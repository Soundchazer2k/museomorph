## ✨ Why MuseoMorph?

MuseoMorph is an open-source desktop app that transforms your photo into artwork inspired by the great artists and movements of history.

This project grew out of months of experimenting with Google’s **NanoBanana** image model. Early attempts with loose prompts (“make me look like Van Gogh”) produced outputs that felt plasticky and modern — closer to filters than paintings. Through trial and error, I learned that:

- **Loose prompts → generic defaults.**
- **Tight, detailed prompts → better authenticity.**
- **Iterative refinement is essential.**

MuseoMorph encodes those lessons into the **Universal Museum-Grade Prompt Framework (v4.2)** — a scaffold designed to respect artists’ materials, methods, and contexts.

MuseoMorph is not about counterfeiting or reproducing real works. No frames, no logos, no signatures. It’s about playful interpretation — a **toy-like art lab** that also invites users to learn about art history.

## 🖼️ Features

- **Museum-inspired UX:** Landing page with collections, gallery-style style pages, and clean detail views.
- **Markdown-driven styles:** Each `.md` file encodes ratios, modes, flags, and educational blurbs. Drop one in → app auto-detects it.
- **Multi-subject support:** Works with single portraits or group photos (manual face detection by default; auto toggle available).
- **Respectful prompts:** Guardrails for age, gender, wardrobe, and IP safety.
- **Local-first:** Runs fully on your computer. No image uploads.
- **Your API key, your control:** Start with Gemini/NanoBanana. Other providers may be added later.

## 📚 Learn as You Play

Each collection and style page includes short educational blurbs:

- When the movement began
- Key figures and themes
- What made it distinctive

Click into an artist for more detail. Think of it as browsing the **Met** or **MoMA** websites — curated and inviting — with the bonus that you can put yourself in the art.

MuseoMorph is a **playful art lab**: fun first, but also a way to appreciate the craft of artists.
