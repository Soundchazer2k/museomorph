# Oskar Kokoschka


## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**
  - *Traditional Painted:* `painterly-contour`, `fresco-matte`, `tempera-precise`, `watercolor-soft`, `acrylic-flat`
  - *Drawing/Illustration:* `pen-crosshatch`, `brush-wash`, `charcoal-smudge`, `gouache-opaque`, `poster-ink`, `litho-wash`
  - *Print/Reproduction:* `engrave-hatch`, `woodblock-carved`, `silkscreen-layered`, `offset-dot`, `halftone-dot`
  - *Mosaic/Decorative:* `mosaic-tessera`, `icon-flat`, `stained-glass-lead`, `byzantine-gold`, `manuscript-miniature`
  - *Digital/Modern:* `vector-crisp`, `pixel-stepped`, `digital-painted`, `3d-rendered`
  - *Photographic:* `diffusion-soft`, `diffusion-glam`, `film-grain-triX`, `hard-flash`, `platinum-plate`, `color-surge`
  - *Stylized:* `geometric-faceted`, `organic-flowing`, `caricature-exaggerated`
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `frontal-rigid`, `contrapposto`, `power-stance`, `candid-motion`, `foreshortened-diagonal`, `erotic-tension`, `gestural-fluid`.
- **Canvas Control Flags (choose one):** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`, `format-native`, `source-respect`.
- **Media Hybrid Flag (optional):** `photo-illustration-collage`, `vector-screenprint`, `cutout-montage`.
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** For historical publication styles (comics, magazines, prints), use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.).
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **4:3 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Viennese Expressionist psychological portraiture** for **oil on canvas with nervous brushwork**.
- Identity via frantic energy/psychological penetration/inner vision manifestation.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original psychological portrait avoiding copyrighted elements appropriate to Viennese Expressionist tradition.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `nervous-animated`
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-penetration`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend`
- **Style Dominance:** Kokoschka's nervous brushwork and psychological vision override physical appearance.
- **Mode Selector:** psychological portrait

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `4:3` (balanced landscape for psychological portraits)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with swirling psychological atmosphere
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject dominance 70% with turbulent environmental context
- **Background Treatment:** Extend nervous, frantic brushstrokes and turbulent color fields to fill 4:3 canvas space
- **Format Justification:** 4:3 ratio serves Kokoschka's balanced psychological portraits with atmospheric context

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** No formal art training leading to intuitive approach, Vienna Secession rebellion, primitive art directness, psychological analysis, Freudian subconscious exploration
- **Medium/Production method:** Oil on canvas with nervous, animated brushwork and frantic energy application
- **Thematic purpose:** Manifestation of inner vision through subconscious, psychological penetration beyond surface appearance, catastrophic premonition
- **5 hallmark motifs:** Nervous, swirling and frantic brushstrokes; turbulent, nihilistic atmospheric backgrounds; psychological rather than optical vision; visible anxiety and scratch marks; catastrophic emotional intensity
- **Period framing:** 1900s-1920s Viennese Expressionist psychological exploration period
- **Tone Tag:** Frantic psychological intensity with catastrophic premonition
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Early 20th century Viennese painting with untrained, intuitive expressionist techniques

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line:** Nervous, animated lines with visible anxiety and scratch marks; frantic, swirling movements
- **Color:** Vibrant and contrasting colors serving psychological rather than naturalistic purposes
- **Texture:** Visible brushstrokes creating anxious, scratch-marked surfaces; nervous energy made tangible
- **Edge:** Agitated, uncertain edges reflecting psychological turbulence
- **Stroke economy:** Frantic, energetic marks following emotional rather than formal logic
- **Surface depth:** Turbulent atmospheric space reflecting inner psychological states
- **Detail hierarchy:** Essential psychological elements emphasized through nervous energy
- **Material simulation:** Authentic oil painting with characteristic nervous brushwork texture
- **Pose Anchors:** Psychological intensity through inner energy representation - hands expressing internal tension, eyes revealing psychological depth
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Proportions serving psychological rather than naturalistic truth
- **Material Authenticity Anchor:** Traditional oil on canvas with distinctive nervous, untrained brushwork
- **Period Consistency Anchor:** 1900s-1920s Viennese painting methods with intuitive expressionist approach
- **Production Method Anchor:** Direct, untrained painting techniques with psychological intensity
- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition designed for 4:3 format balancing psychological subject with turbulent atmospheric context

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**WARDROBE TRACKS:**

- **Adult masculine:** Bourgeois clothing reflecting Kokoschka's portrait subjects - suits, formal wear, intellectual attire
- **Adult feminine:** Elegant dresses, artistic clothing, reflecting Vienna's cultural elite
- **Aristocratic:** Clothing reflecting the tubercular aristocrats and cultural figures he painted

**FABRIC BEHAVIOR:** Clothing rendered with same nervous energy as flesh; fabrics follow psychological rather than gravitational logic

**ACCESSORY CAPS:** Minimalist 1-2 (objects reflecting subject's psychological state or social position)

**COLOR PALETTE:** Vibrant contrasting colors - blues, greens, reds applied for psychological impact rather than naturalistic accuracy

**WARDROBE VARIATION REQUIRED:** Cycle through period-appropriate clothing rendered with psychological rather than fashion emphasis

**PROPS:** Maximum 2 objects serving psychological narrative or social commentary

**COHERENCE FILTER:** All elements support psychological penetration and social observation

**YAML PROP POOLS:**

```yaml
kokoschka_objects:
  psychological_items: [books, musical_instruments, artistic_materials, personal_objects]
  social_symbols: [jewelry, cultural_artifacts, status_objects, letters]
  artistic_tools: [brushes, palette, canvas, creative_materials]
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "smooth academic finish"
- "calm brushwork", "photographic precision", "decorative Art Nouveau elements"
- "peaceful atmosphere", "conventional beauty", "static composition"
- "controlled brushwork", "harmonious colors", "composed surfaces", "careful rendering"

**✅ Canvas Positives:**

- "exactly 4:3", "recomposed for psychological balance", "turbulent atmospheric context"
- "frantically nervous brushwork", "psychological penetration", "visible anxiety scratch marks"
- "authentic oil painting texture", "untrained intuitive energy", "Viennese Expressionist intensity"
- "psychologically disturbing colors", "frantic nervous energy", "anxiety-ridden surface texture"

**Vocabulary warnings:** Avoid "calm," "peaceful," "refined" to prevent academic or decorative qualities

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (4:3 Balanced):**

- **Balanced emphasis:** Subject dominance 70% with significant turbulent atmospheric context 30%
- **Psychological staging:** Nervous energy balanced between figure and environment

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective regime:** Psychological space with turbulent, swirling atmospheric elements
- **Grid/symmetry:** Asymmetrical compositions driven by nervous energy and psychological tension
- **Figure:ground:** 70% figure with 30% frantic atmospheric background
- **Density:** Rich psychological information conveyed through nervous brushwork intensity
- **Lighting logic:** Psychological lighting serving inner vision rather than optical accuracy
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** Nervous energy filling space with psychological significance optimized for 4:3 format

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Oil on canvas with nervous brushwork texture and visible anxiety marks
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely (authentic to painting tradition)
- **Production Context Anchor:** 1900s-1920s Viennese studio painting with untrained, intuitive approach
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for 4:3 format balancing psychological subject with turbulent atmospheric context

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**BINARY:** Omit entirely

**IF ALLOWED:** N/A - Kokoschka's psychological paintings exclude text integration

**HISTORICAL ACCURACY:** Pure painting tradition focused on psychological penetration through brushwork

**PRODUCTION METHOD INTEGRATION:** N/A - emphasis on nervous, animated painting surface
