# Ernst Ludwig Kirchner


## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**
  - *Traditional Painted:* `painterly-contour`, `fresco-matte`, `tempera-precise`, `watercolor-soft`, `acrylic-flat`
  - *Drawing/Illustration:* `pen-crosshatch`, `brush-wash`, `charcoal-smudge`, `gouache-opaque`, `poster-ink`, `litho-wash`
  - *Print/Reproduction:* `engrave-hatch`, `woodblock-carved`, `silkscreen-layered`, `offset-dot`, `halftone-dot`
  - *Mosaic/Decorative:* `mosaic-tessera`, `icon-flat`, `stained-glass-lead`, `byzantine-gold`, `manuscript-miniature`
  - *Digital/Modern:* `vector-crisp`, `pixel-stepped`, `digital-painted`, `3d-rendered`
  - *Photographic:* `diffusion-soft`, `diffusion-glam`, `film-grain-triX`, `hard-flash`, `platinum-plate`, `color-surge`
  - *Stylized:* `geometric-faceted`, `organic-flowing`, `caricature-exaggerated`
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `frontal-rigid`, `contrapposto`, `power-stance`, `candid-motion`, `foreshortened-diagonal`, `erotic-tension`, `gestural-fluid`.
- **Canvas Control Flags (choose one):** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`, `format-native`, `source-respect`.
- **Media Hybrid Flag (optional):** `photo-illustration-collage`, `vector-screenprint`, `cutout-montage`.
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** For historical publication styles (comics, magazines, prints), use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.).
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **German Expressionist urban anxiety** for **oil on canvas with angular modernist style**.
- Identity via angular aggression/metropolitan alienation/geometric distortion.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original urban psychological composition avoiding copyrighted elements appropriate to German Expressionist tradition.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `angular-modernist`
- **Pose Flag:** `urban-alienation`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Kirchner's spiky angular style and urban anxiety override naturalistic representation.
- **Mode Selector:** urban psychological study

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `2:3` (elongated vertical for urban scenes)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with urban vertical emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure dominance 65% with significant urban environmental context
- **Background Treatment:** Extend angular urban elements, street scenes, and metropolitan anxiety to fill 2:3 vertical canvas space
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 elongated vertical ratio serves Kirchner's urban street scenes and metropolitan psychological tension

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Primitivism, African and Oceanic art, medieval German woodcuts, Fauvism color, urban modernist anxiety
- **Medium/Production method:** Oil on canvas with spiky, angular brushwork and bold color application
- **Thematic purpose:** Metropolitan alienation, modern urban anxiety, psychological trauma of war, primitivist rebellion against bourgeois culture
- **5 hallmark motifs:** Spiky, aggressive angular lines; collapsed perspective creating urban claustrophobia; elongated, mask-like faces influenced by primitive art; jarring, contrasting colors; prostitutes as symbols of modern alienation
- **Period framing:** 1905-1925 German Expressionist Die Brücke movement and urban Berlin period
- **Tone Tag:** Urban anxiety with primitivist rebellion
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Early 20th century German painting with Die Brücke group techniques and primitivist influences

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line:** Spiky, aggressive angular lines creating urban tension and psychological anxiety
- **Color:** Jarring, contrasting colors serving emotional rather than naturalistic purposes; bold primitivist palette
- **Texture:** Bold, direct brushwork with angular, aggressive surface treatment
- **Edge:** Sharp, angular edges creating psychological tension and urban claustrophobia
- **Stroke economy:** Direct, aggressive marks serving urban anxiety and primitivist directness
- **Surface depth:** Collapsed perspective creating claustrophobic urban spaces
- **Detail hierarchy:** Essential urban elements emphasized through angular distortion and color contrast
- **Material simulation:** Authentic oil painting with bold, direct German Expressionist techniques
- **Pose Anchors:** Urban alienation through angular positioning, metropolitan anxiety, confrontational stances
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Elongated proportions serving urban psychological truth rather than naturalistic accuracy
- **Material Authenticity Anchor:** Traditional oil on canvas with Die Brücke group angular techniques
- **Period Consistency Anchor:** 1905-1925 German painting methods with primitivist and urban modernist approach
- **Production Method Anchor:** Bold, direct painting techniques influenced by woodcut and primitivist art
- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition designed for 2:3 elongated format emphasizing urban verticality and metropolitan tension

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**WARDROBE TRACKS:**

- **Adult masculine:** Urban bourgeois clothing, military uniforms (reflecting war trauma), artist's clothing
- **Adult feminine:** Street fashion, prostitute attire as symbol of modernity, urban working women's clothing
- **Urban modern:** Clothing reflecting early 20th century metropolitan life and social change

**FABRIC BEHAVIOR:** Clothing rendered with angular distortion reflecting urban psychological states

**ACCESSORY CAPS:** Minimalist 1-2 (objects reflecting urban modern life or war trauma)

**COLOR PALETTE:** Bold, jarring contrasts - acidic greens, electric blues, harsh reds serving psychological rather than naturalistic purposes

**WARDROBE VARIATION REQUIRED:** Cycle through urban modern clothing with angular, distorted rendering emphasizing psychological alienation

**PROPS:** Maximum 2 objects serving urban or war-related narrative

**COHERENCE FILTER:** All elements support urban anxiety and modernist psychological themes

**YAML PROP Pools:**

```yaml
kirchner_objects:
  urban_symbols: [city_streets, electric_lights, modern_architecture, transportation]
  war_trauma: [military_items, medical_objects, broken_objects, letters]
  primitivist_art: [masks, tribal_objects, folk_art_items, woodcut_tools]
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "smooth academic finish"
- "peaceful rural scenes", "classical beauty", "decorative refinement"
- "soft curves", "romantic sentimentality", "bourgeois comfort"
- "naturalistic proportions", "conventional facial features", "harmonious color schemes"
- "spiky hair", "radiating hair", "wild hair", "flowing locks"

**✅ Canvas Positives:**

- "exactly 2:3", "recomposed for urban vertical emphasis", "metropolitan psychological tension"
- "violently angular geometric planes", "African mask-influenced faces", "acidic jarring color assault"
- "authentic oil painting texture", "Die Brücke group techniques", "German Expressionist anxiety"
- "choppy hack-like brushwork", "suffocating collapsed perspective", "primitivist geometric simplification"

**Vocabulary warnings:** Avoid "peaceful," "comfortable," "refined" to prevent bourgeois or rural idyllic qualities

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (2:3 Elongated Vertical):**

- **Vertical emphasis:** Urban scene dominance with figure integration 65% and metropolitan context 35%
- **Urban staging:** Street scenes emphasizing psychological alienation and metropolitan anxiety

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective regime:** Collapsed urban perspective creating claustrophobic metropolitan spaces
- **Grid/symmetry:** Angular, tilted compositions emphasizing urban disequilibrium
- **Figure:ground:** 65% figure-urban integration with 35% metropolitan environmental context
- **Density:** Rich urban information conveyed through angular distortion and color contrast
- **Lighting logic:** Harsh electric lighting serving urban modernist rather than natural illumination
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** Dense urban elements with angular efficiency optimized for 2:3 vertical format

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Oil on canvas with bold angular brushwork texture reflecting urban anxiety
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely (authentic to painting tradition)
- **Production Context Anchor:** 1905-1925 German Die Brücke group painting with primitivist and urban influences
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for 2:3 elongated format emphasizing urban verticality and metropolitan psychological tension

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**BINARY:** Omit entirely

**IF ALLOWED:** N/A - Kirchner's paintings exclude text integration

**HISTORICAL ACCURACY:** Pure painting tradition focused on urban psychological expression through form and color

**PRODUCTION METHOD INTEGRATION:** N/A - emphasis on angular painting surface and urban anxiety expression
