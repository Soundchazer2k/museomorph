# Egon Schiele


## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**
  - *Traditional Painted:* `painterly-contour`, `fresco-matte`, `tempera-precise`, `watercolor-soft`, `acrylic-flat`
  - *Drawing/Illustration:* `pen-crosshatch`, `brush-wash`, `charcoal-smudge`, `gouache-opaque`, `poster-ink`, `litho-wash`
  - *Print/Reproduction:* `engrave-hatch`, `woodblock-carved`, `silkscreen-layered`, `offset-dot`, `halftone-dot`
  - *Mosaic/Decorative:* `mosaic-tessera`, `icon-flat`, `stained-glass-lead`, `byzantine-gold`, `manuscript-miniature`
  - *Digital/Modern:* `vector-crisp`, `pixel-stepped`, `digital-painted`, `3d-rendered`
  - *Photographic:* `diffusion-soft`, `diffusion-glam`, `film-grain-triX`, `hard-flash`, `platinum-plate`, `color-surge`
  - *Stylized:* `geometric-faceted`, `organic-flowing`, `caricature-exaggerated`
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `frontal-rigid`, `contrapposto`, `power-stance`, `candid-motion`, `foreshortened-diagonal`, `erotic-tension`, `gestural-fluid`.
- **Canvas Control Flags (choose one):** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`, `format-native`, `source-respect`.
- **Media Hybrid Flag (optional):** `photo-illustration-collage`, `vector-screenprint`, `cutout-montage`.
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** For historical publication styles (comics, magazines, prints), use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.).
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Viennese Expressionist raw figuration** for **oil on canvas psychological portraiture**.
- Identity via angular distortion/raw vulnerability/psychological exposure.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original psychological figure study avoiding copyrighted elements appropriate to Viennese Expressionist tradition.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `angular-distorted`
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-vulnerability`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Schiele's angular distortion and psychological rawness override conventional beauty standards.
- **Mode Selector:** psychological figure study

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `2:3` (elongated vertical for psychological tension)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with elongated vertical emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure dominance 80% with minimal background context
- **Background Treatment:** Stark, often empty backgrounds with subtle color washes to emphasize psychological isolation
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 elongated vertical ratio serves Schiele's intense psychological focus and angular figure distortion

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Gustav Klimt's linear elegance, Vienna Secession rebellion, medieval manuscript intensity, primitive art directness, psychological analysis
- **Medium/Production method:** Mixed media on paper with gouache, watercolor, and aggressive linear drawing techniques creating drawing-painting hybrid approach
- **Thematic purpose:** Uncompromising psychological truth, raw sexuality, death obsession, moral critique of bourgeois hypocrisy
- **5 hallmark motifs:** Sharp, angular and febrile lines defining form; distorted, elongated body proportions; stark psychological isolation; raw, unidealized sexuality; morbid fascination with decay and death
- **Period framing:** 1910s Viennese Expressionist rebellion against Art Nouveau decoration
- **Tone Tag:** Raw psychological intensity with morbid introspection
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Early 20th century Viennese painting with Expressionist psychological directness

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line:** Sharp, angular, febrile lines that define psychological rather than anatomical truth
- **Color:** Raw, unmodulated colors often applied directly; sickly greens, flesh tones, stark contrasts
- **Texture:** Relatively smooth application with emphasis on linear definition over painterly surface
- **Edge:** Hard, sharp edges creating psychological tension and anatomical distortion
- **Stroke economy:** Economical, precise marks that serve psychological expression over decorative beauty
- **Surface depth:** Flattened space emphasizing figure over environmental context
- **Detail hierarchy:** Hyper-focus on hands, faces, and sexually charged body parts
- **Material simulation:** Authentic oil and gouache techniques with linear precision
- **Pose Anchors:** Psychological tension through contorted poses, introspective gestures, vulnerable positioning
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Distorted proportions serving psychological rather than naturalistic truth
- **Material Authenticity Anchor:** Traditional oil and gouache on canvas with linear clarity
- **Period Consistency Anchor:** 1910s Viennese painting methods with Expressionist psychological approach
- **Production Method Anchor:** Precise brushwork and drawing techniques combined with raw color application
- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition designed for 2:3 elongated format emphasizing psychological verticality and isolation

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**WARDROBE TRACKS:**

- **Adult masculine:** Simple shirts, often partially unbuttoned or removed; minimal, revealing clothing
- **Adult feminine:** Simple undergarments, flowing fabric, often partially draped or removed
- **Androgynous:** Flowing robes or minimal clothing emphasizing vulnerable human form

**FABRIC BEHAVIOR:** Simplified drapery that emphasizes body contours and psychological states rather than fashion

**ACCESSORY CAPS:** Minimalist 0-1 (symbolic objects only)

**COLOR PALETTE:** Muted earth tones, flesh colors, stark whites and blacks, with occasional symbolic reds

**WARDROBE VARIATION REQUIRED:** Cycle through minimal clothing arrangements emphasizing psychological vulnerability rather than fashion

**PROPS:** Maximum 1 symbolic object serving psychological narrative (mirror, flower, book, personal item)

**COHERENCE FILTER:** All elements support psychological intensity and raw human truth

**YAML PROP POOLS:**

```yaml
schiele_objects:
  psychological_symbols: [mirror, wilted_flower, personal_letter, artistic_materials]
  intimacy_objects: [simple_jewelry, fabric_draping, personal_clothing]
  mortality_symbols: [dried_flowers, skull_studies, medical_items]
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "decorative Art Nouveau elements"
- "idealized beauty", "classical proportions", "ornate details"
- "cheerful colors", "romantic sentimentality", "bourgeois propriety"
- "soft curves", "harmonious color relationships", "pleasant compositions", "naturalistic anatomy"

**✅ Canvas Positives:**

- "exactly 2:3", "recomposed for elongated psychological tension", "vertical figure dominance"
- "brutally sharp febrile lines", "psychological distortion", "raw uncompromising truth"
- "authentic oil and gouache techniques", "brutal linear precision", "Viennese Expressionist rebellion"
- "stark psychological isolation", "anatomical destruction", "tortured emotional intensity"

**Vocabulary warnings:** Avoid "beautiful," "decorative," "elegant" to prevent idealized or ornamental qualities

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (2:3 Elongated Vertical):**

- **Vertical emphasis:** Figure dominance 85% of vertical space with minimal environmental context
- **Cropping strategy:** Crop at unexpected points - mid-thigh, mid-torso, or cutting through limbs to create visual anxiety
- **Positioning specifications:** Eyes positioned 1/3 higher than normal portrait placement; figures positioned to violate comfortable viewing expectations

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective regime:** Dramatically flattened space with figure pressed against picture plane
- **Grid/symmetry:** Asymmetrical compositions that create psychological unease through off-balance positioning
- **Figure:ground:** 85% figure dominance with 15% stark, psychologically oppressive empty background
- **Density:** Concentrated psychological intensity with complete elimination of decorative elements
- **Lighting logic:** Harsh, unforgiving lighting that reveals every psychological flaw and physical imperfection
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** Intense focus on elongated necks (150% normal), unnaturally long bony fingers, jutting shoulder blades, visible rib cages through skin optimized for 2:3 vertical format

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Paper substrate with pencil foundation visible through transparent watercolor washes
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely (authentic to drawing-painting hybrid tradition)
- **Production Context Anchor:** 1910s Viennese mixed media technique with aggressive pencil work as foundation
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for 2:3 elongated format with 85% vertical figure dominance and strategic cropping creating psychological discomfort

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**BINARY:** Omit entirely

**IF ALLOWED:** N/A - Schiele's psychological paintings exclude text integration

**HISTORICAL ACCURACY:** Pure painting tradition focused on psychological figure studies

**PRODUCTION METHOD INTEGRATION:** N/A - emphasis on raw psychological expression through form and color
