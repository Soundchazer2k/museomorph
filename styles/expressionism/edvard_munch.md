  Edvard Munch externalized anxiety through swirling colour bands, elongated
  silhouettes, and scraped impasto that vibrates like sound. MuseoMorph keeps
  that haunted charge while enforcing modern safety rules so the homage stays
  respectful and original.

# Edvard Munch


## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**
  - *Traditional Painted:* `painterly-contour`, `fresco-matte`, `tempera-precise`, `watercolor-soft`, `acrylic-flat`
  - *Drawing/Illustration:* `pen-crosshatch`, `brush-wash`, `charcoal-smudge`, `gouache-opaque`, `poster-ink`, `litho-wash`
  - *Print/Reproduction:* `engrave-hatch`, `woodblock-carved`, `silkscreen-layered`, `offset-dot`, `halftone-dot`
  - *Mosaic/Decorative:* `mosaic-tessera`, `icon-flat`, `stained-glass-lead`, `byzantine-gold`, `manuscript-miniature`
  - *Digital/Modern:* `vector-crisp`, `pixel-stepped`, `digital-painted`, `3d-rendered`
  - *Photographic:* `diffusion-soft`, `diffusion-glam`, `film-grain-triX`, `hard-flash`, `platinum-plate`, `color-surge`
  - *Stylized:* `geometric-faceted`, `organic-flowing`, `caricature-exaggerated`
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `frontal-rigid`, `contrapposto`, `power-stance`, `candid-motion`, `foreshortened-diagonal`, `erotic-tension`, `gestural-fluid`.
- **Canvas Control Flags (choose one):** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`, `format-native`, `source-respect`.
- **Media Hybrid Flag (optional):** `photo-illustration-collage`, `vector-screenprint`, `cutout-montage`.
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** For historical publication styles (comics, magazines, prints), use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.).
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Norwegian Symbolist-Expressionist painting** for **oil on canvas psychological portrait**.
- Identity via psychological gesture/tormented expression/symbolic distortion.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original psychological composition avoiding copyrighted elements appropriate to Symbolist-Expressionist tradition.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `painterly-contour`
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend`
- **Style Dominance:** Munch's symbolic distortion and color psychology override naturalistic representation.
- **Mode Selector:** psychological portrait

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `3:4` (classical portrait)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with atmospheric psychological space
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject dominance 70% with symbolic environmental elements
- **Background Treatment:** Extend swirling, undulating patterns and non-naturalistic color fields to fill vertical canvas space
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 portrait ratio serves Munch's intimate psychological inquiry and symbolic intensity

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Van Gogh's expressive brushwork, Gauguin's symbolic color, Norwegian folk art, medieval spirituality
- **Medium/Production method:** Oil on canvas with thick impasto and flowing, undulating brushstrokes
- **Thematic purpose:** Externalization of internal psychological states, universal human anxiety, death, love, isolation
- **5 hallmark motifs:** Swirling, wavy lines mirroring emotional turbulence; non-naturalistic color expressing psychological states; simplified, mask-like faces; diagonal compositions creating visual anxiety; symbolic landscapes reflecting inner torment
- **Period framing:** 1890s-1910s Norwegian Symbolist-Expressionist transition period
- **Tone Tag:** Existential melancholy with spiritual intensity
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Traditional oil painting techniques with Post-Impressionist color innovation and Symbolist psychological content

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line:** Flowing, undulating contours that mirror psychological states; wavy, unstable horizons; diagonal tension lines
- **Color:** Non-naturalistic psychological palette - fiery orange-reds for anguish, sickly greens for psychological distress, deep blues for melancholy
- **Texture:** Visible brushstrokes with moderate impasto; smooth psychological transitions between color fields
- **Edge:** Soft, dissolved edges for psychological uncertainty; sharp contrasts for emotional intensity
- **Stroke economy:** Deliberate, flowing brushwork that follows emotional rather than anatomical logic
- **Surface depth:** Flattened perspective with symbolic rather than realistic spatial relationships
- **Detail hierarchy:** Simplified forms focusing on essential psychological elements over naturalistic detail
- **Material simulation:** Authentic oil painting surface with visible canvas texture
- **Pose Anchors:** Psychological tension expressed through body language - hands to head, distant gaze, angular positioning
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Symbolic scale - figures may be enlarged or diminished based on psychological significance
- **Material Authenticity Anchor:** Traditional oil on canvas techniques with visible brushwork and paint texture
- **Period Consistency Anchor:** 1890s Norwegian painting methods with Symbolist color theory
- **Production Method Anchor:** Hand-mixed oil pigments applied with traditional brushes on primed canvas
- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition designed for 3:4 vertical format emphasizing psychological verticality

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**WARDROBE TRACKS:**

- **Adult masculine:** Simple dark suits, white shirts, minimal bourgeois clothing reflecting Munch's own style
- **Adult feminine:** Flowing white or red dresses, simplified forms emphasizing symbolic rather than fashionable elements
- **Androgynous:** Flowing robes or simplified garments that emphasize universal human form

**FABRIC BEHAVIOR:** Simplified drapery that follows emotional rather than gravitational logic; fabrics may appear to flow with psychological energy

**ACCESSORY CAPS:** Minimalist 0-1 (symbolic objects only)

**COLOR PALETTE:** Restricted to psychological primaries - white for innocence/death, red for passion/blood, black for despair, with Munch's characteristic non-naturalistic hues

**WARDROBE VARIATION REQUIRED:** Cycle through white, red, and black primary garments with simplified, flowing forms

**PROPS:** Maximum 1 symbolic object (skull, flower, mirror, book) that serves psychological narrative

**COHERENCE FILTER:** All elements support symbolic-psychological narrative; eliminate decorative details

**YAML PROP POOLS:**

```yaml
symbolic_objects:
  death_symbols: [skull, wilted_flower, empty_chair, mirror]
  psychological_items: [letter, book, medicine_bottle, cigarette]
  relationship_symbols: [ring, photograph, broken_object]
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "photographic realism"
- "decorative Art Nouveau elements", "ornate details", "Vienna Secession gold"
- "bright cheerful colors", "naturalistic lighting", "academic precision"
- "stable horizontal lines", "realistic depth", "detailed naturalistic features"

**✅ Canvas Positives:**

- "exactly 3:4", "recomposed for portrait intensity", "psychological vertical emphasis"
- "flowing undulating brushwork", "symbolic color psychology", "existential melancholy"
- "authentic oil painting techniques", "visible canvas texture", "Norwegian Symbolist tradition"
- "dramatically simplified archetypal forms", "unstable tilted perspectives", "visual anxiety through diagonal discord"

**Vocabulary warnings:** Avoid "ornate," "decorative," "cheerful" to prevent generation of inappropriate stylistic elements

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (3:4 Portrait):**

- **Vertical emphasis:** Subject dominance ≥70% with psychological environmental context
- **Hierarchical staging:** Central figure with symbolic background elements supporting psychological narrative

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective regime:** Flattened, symbolic space with wavy, unstable horizon lines
- **Grid/symmetry:** Diagonal tension creating psychological unease
- **Figure:ground:** 70% figure dominance with 30% symbolic atmospheric background
- **Density:** Simplified forms with essential psychological elements only
- **Lighting logic:** Non-naturalistic, expressive lighting serving psychological mood
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** Minimal detail, maximum psychological impact optimized for 3:4 vertical format

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Oil on canvas with visible weave texture and traditional priming
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely (authentic to painting tradition)
- **Production Context Anchor:** 1890s Norwegian studio painting on traditional canvas support
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for 3:4 portrait format emphasizing psychological verticality and intimacy

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**BINARY:** Omit entirely

**IF ALLOWED:** N/A - Munch's psychological paintings exclude text integration

**HISTORICAL ACCURACY:** Pure painting tradition without typographic elements

**PRODUCTION METHOD INTEGRATION:** N/A - focus remains on painted surface
