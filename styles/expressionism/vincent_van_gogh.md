# Vincent van Gogh


## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**
  - *Traditional Painted:* `painterly-contour`, `fresco-matte`, `tempera-precise`, `watercolor-soft`, `acrylic-flat`
  - *Drawing/Illustration:* `pen-crosshatch`, `brush-wash`, `charcoal-smudge`, `gouache-opaque`, `poster-ink`, `litho-wash`
  - *Print/Reproduction:* `engrave-hatch`, `woodblock-carved`, `silkscreen-layered`, `offset-dot`, `halftone-dot`
  - *Mosaic/Decorative:* `mosaic-tessera`, `icon-flat`, `stained-glass-lead`, `byzantine-gold`, `manuscript-miniature`
  - *Digital/Modern:* `vector-crisp`, `pixel-stepped`, `digital-painted`, `3d-rendered`
  - *Photographic:* `diffusion-soft`, `diffusion-glam`, `film-grain-triX`, `hard-flash`, `platinum-plate`, `color-surge`
  - *Stylized:* `geometric-faceted`, `organic-flowing`, `caricature-exaggerated`
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `frontal-rigid`, `contrapposto`, `power-stance`, `candid-motion`, `foreshortened-diagonal`, `erotic-tension`, `gestural-fluid`.
- **Canvas Control Flags (choose one):** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`, `format-native`, `source-respect`.
- **Media Hybrid Flag (optional):** `photo-illustration-collage`, `vector-screenprint`, `cutout-montage`.
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** For historical publication styles (comics, magazines, prints), use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.).
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **4:5 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Post-Impressionist expressive painting** for **oil on canvas with thick impasto**.
- Identity via emotional brushwork/vivid color intensity/swirling energy.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original expressive composition avoiding copyrighted elements appropriate to Post-Impressionist tradition.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `painterly-contour`
- **Pose Flag:** `emotional-intensity`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend`
- **Style Dominance:** Van Gogh's expressive brushwork and emotional color override naturalistic representation.
- **Mode Selector:** expressive painting

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `4:5` (van Gogh's preferred proportions)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with swirling atmospheric elements
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject dominance 65% with energetic environmental context
- **Background Treatment:** Extend characteristic swirling patterns and vibrant color fields to fill 4:5 canvas space
- **Format Justification:** 4:5 ratio serves van Gogh's dynamic compositions and emotional intensity

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Japanese woodblock prints, Impressionist color theory, Pointillist technique, peasant life realism, Symbolist spirituality
- **Medium/Production method:** Oil on canvas with distinctive thick impasto application and visible brushwork
- **Thematic purpose:** Emotional expression through color and movement, spiritual connection to nature, psychological self-examination
- **5 hallmark motifs:** Frenzied, rhythmic brushstrokes following form; intense, often non-naturalistic color; swirling, energetic patterns in sky and landscape; thick impasto creating tactile surface; cypress trees and sunflowers as spiritual symbols
- **Period framing:** 1880s-1890s Post-Impressionist innovation period
- **Tone Tag:** Passionate intensity with spiritual yearning
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Traditional oil painting with innovative brushwork and color application techniques

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line:** Dynamic, rhythmic brushstrokes following form and emotion; swirling, energetic contours
- **Color:** Intense, often complementary contrasts; pure pigment application; emotional rather than naturalistic color choices
- **Texture:** Heavy impasto creating sculptural paint surface; visible brushwork defining form and movement
- **Edge:** Bold, confident edges with paint applied directly from tube; minimal blending
- **Stroke economy:** Deliberate, energetic marks that serve both form and emotional expression
- **Surface depth:** Maintained three-dimensional perspective with expressive spatial distortion
- **Detail hierarchy:** Essential forms emphasized through color and brushwork intensity
- **Material simulation:** Authentic oil painting with characteristic paint thickness and texture
- **Pose Anchors:** Emotional gesture - hand to head in contemplation, direct intense gaze, working postures
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Naturalistic human proportions with occasional symbolic emphasis
- **Material Authenticity Anchor:** Traditional oil on canvas with distinctive thick paint application
- **Period Consistency Anchor:** 1880s-1890s French painting methods with Post-Impressionist innovations
- **Production Method Anchor:** Hand-mixed pigments applied with palette knife and brush techniques
- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition designed for 4:5 format emphasizing van Gogh's characteristic dynamic energy

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**WARDROBE TRACKS:**

- **Adult masculine:** Simple peasant clothing, artist's smocks, working-class jackets and hats reflecting van Gogh's subjects
- **Adult feminine:** Rural peasant dresses, simple shawls, working women's attire
- **Working class:** Emphasis on laborers, farmers, and humble rural inhabitants

**FABRIC BEHAVIOR:** Simplified forms emphasizing the dignity of labor; fabrics follow brushwork rhythm

**ACCESSORY CAPS:** Minimalist 0-2 (working tools, simple hats, basic jewelry)

**COLOR PALETTE:** Van Gogh's characteristic palette - yellows, blues, oranges, with bold complementary contrasts

**WARDROBE VARIATION REQUIRED:** Cycle through earthy working colors, bright sunflower yellows, deep blues, avoiding bourgeois elegance

**PROPS:** Maximum 2 objects - sunflowers, books, pipes, artist materials, rural working tools

**COHERENCE FILTER:** All elements support themes of labor, nature, and spiritual seeking

**YAML PROP POOLS:**

```yaml
van_gogh_objects:
  nature_symbols: [sunflowers, cypress_trees, wheat_sheaves, irises]
  working_life: [pipes, books, artist_brushes, farming_tools]
  spiritual_items: [bible, letters, candles, simple_crosses]
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "smooth academic finish"
- "muted colors", "invisible brushwork", "photographic precision"
- "bourgeois elegance", "decorative refinement", "salon painting style"

**✅ Canvas Positives:**

- "exactly 4:5", "recomposed for van Gogh proportions", "dynamic emotional composition"
- "thick impasto", "visible energetic brushwork", "intense complementary colors"
- "authentic oil painting texture", "sculptural paint surface", "Post-Impressionist innovation"

**Vocabulary warnings:** Avoid "refined," "elegant," "smooth" to prevent academic or salon painting characteristics

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (4:5):**

- **Balanced emphasis:** Subject dominance 65% with significant environmental context creating dynamic energy flow
- **Rhythmic staging:** Energetic compositions with swirling movements and rhythmic brushwork patterns following 4:5 format

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective regime:** Maintained three-dimensional space enhanced by thick paint creating physical surface relief
- **Grid/symmetry:** Dynamic asymmetry with rhythmic brushwork patterns following form direction
- **Figure:ground:** 65% figure with 35% expressive environmental context both rendered with equal paint thickness
- **Density:** Rich visual information achieved through thick paint application and directional brushwork intensity
- **Lighting logic:** Emotional lighting serving expressive goals - paint thickness creating actual shadows and highlights
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** Dense visual information through paint physicality balanced with rhythmic movement optimized for 4:5 format

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Oil on canvas with 3-5mm thick impasto creating sculptural relief surface with visible tool marks
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely (authentic to painting tradition)
- **Production Context Anchor:** 1880s-1890s French Post-Impressionist studio painting with thick paint application techniques
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for 4:5 format emphasizing van Gogh's dynamic energy and physical paint presence

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**BINARY:** Omit entirely

**IF ALLOWED:** N/A - Van Gogh's paintings exclude text integration

**HISTORICAL ACCURACY:** Pure painting tradition focused on color and brushwork expression

**PRODUCTION METHOD INTEGRATION:** N/A - emphasis on painted surface qualities
