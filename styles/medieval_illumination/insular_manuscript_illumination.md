**Version:** 4.2
 **Purpose:** A forensically-researched scaffold for generating authentic Insular manuscript illumination (c. 700-800 AD) based on visual evidence analysis of the Lindisfarne Gospels, Book of Kells, Book of Durrow, and Tara Brooch metalwork techniques. Emphasizes Celtic/Germanic/Mediterranean synthesis with microscopic precision and theological light symbolism.

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Maintain historical stylistic conventions while preserving core facial structure, bone geometry, and distinctive features through period-appropriate representation methods.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("0.15-0.35mm wire-equivalent lines", "4-6 beads per 0.9mm") override descriptive language ("fine", "intricate").
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied (glair binder, hand-placed dots, craquelure formation) supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Insular Material Authenticity:** No lapis lazuli blue (woad only), no modern metallic effects, authentic orpiment cracking characteristics required.
- **Anti-Naturalistic Bias:** Authority to reject individual facial expression and embrace stereotyped evangelist differentiation when historically accurate.
- **Synthesis Requirement:** Balance Celtic interlace, Germanic filigree precision, and Mediterranean iconography in every composition.
- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**
  - `insular-stereotyped`: Period-appropriate representation maintaining individual bone structure and distinctive features within theological conventions
  - `evangelist-theological`: Reading vs. divine vision hierarchy adapted to individual facial geometry, hair characteristics from source
  - `manuscript-symbolic`: Large eyes as light sources while preserving distinctive eye shape, minimal facial modeling maintaining core facial structure
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `frontal-divine-vision`, `reading-contemplative`, `attribute-holding`, `theological-hierarchy`, `manuscript-contained`.
- **Canvas Control Flags (choose one):** `manuscript-proportioned`, `carpet-page-format`, `initial-integrated`, `portrait-framed`.
- **Material Physics Authority:** 8th-century substrate, pigment, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Filigree-equivalent precision affects line weight hierarchy and dot placement accuracy.
- **Theological Program Authority:** Patristic commentary-based iconography takes precedence over generic Christian imagery.
- **Text policy:** Typography as decoration - letters become patterns, words become images (Chi-Rho standard).
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no modern logos/watermarks/signatures.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Religious figures = 8th-century ecclesiastical vestments with accurate textile behavior.
- **Composition boundaries:** Decorative borders integral to composition, no external modern frames.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid Renaissance naturalism, Gothic pointed arches, lapis lazuli blue, flying gallop horses.
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Insular Manuscript Illumination** for **illuminated manuscript page format**.
- Identity via symbolic attributes, theological hierarchy, and manuscript containment rather than facial individualization.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original Celtic/Germanic/Mediterranean synthesis avoiding copyrighted interpretations of medieval art.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag**: `insular-stereotyped`.
- Declare **Pose Flag**: `frontal-divine-vision` or `reading-contemplative`.
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag**: `manuscript-proportioned`.
- **Style Dominance line:** Insular synthesis of Celtic interlace precision, Germanic filigree organization, and Mediterranean theological iconography dominates over naturalistic representation.
- **Mode Selector:** carpet page, evangelist portrait, initial page, narrative cycle.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION (choose one exact specification):**

**INSULAR MANUSCRIPT FORMATS:**

- `2:3` (standard manuscript page proportion)
- `3:4` (deluxe manuscript format / Book of Kells original)
- `1:1` (carpet page / initial letter medallion)
- `4:5` (portable gospel format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** theological-architectural-division with interlace border integration
- **Spatial Allocation:** hierarchical zones respecting filigree-panel organization translated to manuscript scale
- **Background Treatment:** faux metalwork visual language with sunken compartment effect simulation
- **Format Justification:** manuscript proportions serve Celtic interlace complexity with Germanic precision requirements

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Celtic interlace mathematics, Germanic filigree craftsmanship (Tara Brooch standard), Mediterranean patristic iconography, theological light doctrine (Bede's commentaries).
- **Medium/Production method:** Glair (egg white) tempera on calf vellum with iron gall ink script, authentic 8th-century pigment palette with characteristic aging effects.
- **Thematic purpose:** Sacred text transformation, theological instruction through symbolic programs, ecclesiastical prestige display.
- **3–5 hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**
  - Filigree-equivalent line precision: 0.15-0.35mm wire-thickness hierarchy, 4-6 beads per 0.9mm pattern density
  - Hand-placed dot stippling: thousands of individual marks (Lindisfarne Gospels 1,939 red dots documented)
  - Interlace knotwork: mathematical precision with Celtic proportional relationships, zoomorphic integration
  - Evangelist differentiation: stereotyped through attributes/hair color (salt-pepper, ash-blond, chestnut), not facial expression
  - Orpiment craquelure: characteristic age-related crack networks on thick yellow applications
- **Period framing:** c. 700-800 AD, peak Insular monastery production, Celtic/Germanic cultural synthesis period.
- **Tone Tag:** Synthesis-Precision-Theological.
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Monastic scriptorium with access to Continental metalworking techniques, luxury materials indicating royal/episcopal patronage.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

- **Wardrobe tracks:** Ecclesiastical vestments (episcopal, monastic, clerical), secular nobility (Continental influence), evangelist symbolic garments (color-coded theological programs).
- **Fabric behavior:** Geometric drapery with manuscript-appropriate fold patterns, textile weight suggested through precise outline definition, ecclesiastical vestment accuracy for 8th-century standards.
- **Accessory caps:** Minimalist 1-2 theological attributes (gospel book, stylus, scroll, chalice), maximum focus on symbolic clarity and manuscript integration.
- **Color palette restrictions:** Authentic 8th-century pigments only - woad blue, orpiment yellow, verdigris/vergaut greens, toasted lead red/orange, lamp black, iron gall ink.
- **Wardrobe variation required:** Evangelist-specific color programs (John=green, Mark=blue, documented hair colors), theological coordination across manuscript set.
- **Props:** 1 primary theological attribute + optional 1 secondary (total ≤2) with iconographic clarity and manuscript-scale appropriateness.
- **Coherence filter:** All elements support Insular synthesis presentation; fallback = interlace border emphasis with theological clarity.

**YAML prop pools:**

```yaml
