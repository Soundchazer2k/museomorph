- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via photorealistic enhancement and commercial illustration sophistication.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("muscle definition 85-95%", "shadow gradation 15-25 values") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Commercial illustration methodology and painterly pencil techniques supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `photorealistic-painterly` - commercial illustration rendering with painterly pencil values and sophisticated anatomical accuracy
- **Pose Flag:** `adams-signature-staging` - low-angle upward perspectives making characters monumentally imposing, extreme 25-45 degree foreshortening with figures breaking panel boundaries, asymmetrical compositions with 2-3 overlapping characters in complex physical relationships, tilted camera angles creating off-balance tension
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` - extend realistic environments to fill new canvas dimensions
- **Material Physics Authority:** Commercial printing specifications and painterly pencil techniques override aesthetic preferences.
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Comic cover impact viewing distance affects detail hierarchy and muscular definition rendering.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1970s four-color printing with expanded color palette and sophisticated registration techniques.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to completely reject simplified "bigfoot" cartoon anatomy in favor of realistic proportions.
- **Revolutionary Techniques Flag:** `photorealism-mandatory` - complete abandonment of traditional comic book stylization.

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

The artwork must be created in **Neal Adams' signature Bronze Age style** (1967-1972), capturing the aesthetic principles of the artist who revolutionized comics through photorealistic illustration. Channel Adams' background in commercial advertising, syndicated strips, and his innovative approach to bringing sophisticated realism to superhero comics.

**Intended medium**: Four-color process printing on newsprint, pushed to maximum realism and sophisticated color reproduction possible within early 1970s format capabilities.

**Purpose**: Comic book cover demonstrating sophisticated artistic technique and mature visual storytelling that elevated the medium's artistic credibility.

**Key influences**:

- Commercial advertising illustration and agency work (Johnstone & Cushing)
- Syndicated newspaper strip sophistication (Ben Casey)
- Classical fine art anatomy and figure drawing techniques
- Hollywood cinematography and dramatic lighting
- Fashion photography and commercial portrait work
- Painterly illustration techniques applied to comics medium

**Thematic purpose**: Elevate comic book art to compete with commercial illustration and fine art through photorealistic sophistication and mature storytelling.

**5 hallmark motifs with quantified specifications**:

1. **Photorealistic anatomy** with 85-95% accuracy to human muscular structure and proportions
2. **Painterly pencil values** using 15-25 gradation levels with sophisticated tonal modeling
3. **Cinematic lighting effects** with 45-degree key lighting and dramatic rim lighting creating 3D form
4. **Dynamic action poses** with 15-35 degree foreshortening and realistic weight distribution
5. **Commercial illustration finish** with advertising-quality precision and sophisticated detail hierarchy

**Period framing**: Bronze Age realism revolution (1967-1972) bringing commercial illustration sophistication to superhero comics.

**Tone Tag**: Photorealistic sophistication, cinematic drama, commercial illustration quality, mature artistic credibility.

**Production Era Authenticity**: Early 1970s four-color printing with expanded 64-color palette, period-limited halftone screens with visible dot patterns, and characteristic registration imperfections creating authentic newsprint reproduction quality with paper grain texture.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work / Rendering:**

- **Photorealistic precision** with commercial illustration clarity and advertising art sophistication
- **Painterly pencil technique** using side of pencil with varied pressure creating 15-25 value gradations preserved through sophisticated inking interpretation
- **Psychological facial expression** - characters show genuine stress, determination, fear, or exhaustion with subtly furrowed brows, tightened jaw muscles, worried eyes conveying internal emotional states
- **Three-dimensional form modeling** with sophisticated understanding of light, shadow, and volume using classical fine art techniques
- **Anatomically accurate construction** with 85-95% realistic human proportions showing actual physical stress and weight distribution in poses
- **Multiple-figure interaction emphasis** - compositions featuring 2-3 characters in overlapping physical relationships (supporting, grabbing, falling together)
- **Commercial illustration methodology** designed for period-limited four-color reproduction with characteristic newsprint limitations and visible printing artifacts

**Coloring:**

- **Period-authentic 1970s four-color process** using mechanical color separations with visible 65-85 LPI halftone dot patterns, especially in flesh tones and gradated areas
- **Adams color revolution** - expanded 64-color palette with restored "tone yellow" (25%, 50% screens) enabling natural flesh tones instead of flat pink
- **Hard color separations** - distinct boundaries between color areas with minimal blending, characteristic registration drift of 0.5-1mm creating period-authentic imperfections
- **High contrast chiaroscuro** - deep solid blacks (100% K) contrasted with bright highlight areas using stark 80-20 light/dark ratios
- **Environmental color logic** - warm interior building lighting (yellows 50-75% + magentas 25%), cool moonlight/sky (cyans 75% + magentas 25%), authentic material colors
- **Visible printing artifacts** - slight color misregistration, dot gain in shadow areas, paper show-through in highlight areas typical of newsprint reproduction
- **Limited gradient transitions** - color changes occur in 3-4 discrete steps maximum, never smooth digital blending, using mechanical screen patterns only

**Texture:**

- **Commercial illustration surface quality** with advertising-level finish and sophisticated reproduction
- **Painterly pencil texture** with graphite gradations and sophisticated tonal modeling preserved in inking
- **Photorealistic material representation** distinguishing different surface qualities through texture rendering
- **Period-authentic halftone sophistication** with 85-100 LPI screens enabling realistic gradations
- **Sophisticated color registration** maximizing 1970s four-color printing capabilities
- **Three-dimensional texture modeling** using light and shadow to create convincing surface reality

**Pose Anchors:**

- **Low-angle heroic perspectives** - viewpoint positioned below character looking upward at 15-30 degree angle, making figures appear monumentally imposing and larger-than-life
- **Multiple-character compositions prioritized** - feature 2-3 characters minimum in complex overlapping relationships: one character supporting/catching another, figures physically connected through grabbing, pulling, or falling together
- **Panel-breaking extensions mandatory** - cape edges, extended arms, weapons, or flowing hair must extend beyond traditional frame boundaries by 10-20% into white space or margin areas
- **Asymmetrical character arrangements** - reject centered compositions, place main figure at 1/3 rule positioning with supporting characters creating triangular or diagonal compositional flow
- **Tilted horizon compositions** - rotate entire scene 10-20 degrees off vertical axis to create psychological tension and dynamic energy
- **Environmental integration** - characters interacting with architectural elements (leaning on buildings, swinging from structures) with accurate perspective and scale relationships
- **Emotional authenticity** - faces showing genuine fear, determination, exhaustion, or pain with specific micro-expressions: furrowed brows, clenched jaw, worried eyes, stressed facial muscles

**Scale Hierarchy:** Photorealistic proportions emphasizing anatomical accuracy over stylized exaggeration (realistic anatomy 85-95%, dramatic lighting 70%, sophisticated detail 60%)

**Material Authenticity:** Authentic 1970s commercial printing techniques with painterly pencil methodology - no modern digital effects

**Period Consistency:** All elements coherent with 1970s commercial illustration revolution and Bronze Age sophistication

**Production Method:** Four-color process printing with expanded color palette and sophisticated halftone screens enabling realistic gradations

**Canvas Adaptation:** Composition designed for 2:3 comic cover format with cinematic staging and photorealistic presentation
