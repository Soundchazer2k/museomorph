## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via graphic design sophistication and cinematic staging.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("op-art pattern density 80-90%", "3D typography depth 15-25mm") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Graphic design methodology and printing techniques supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `graphic-design-precision` - clean commercial illustration rendering with advertising art sophistication and geometric stylization
- **Pose Flag:** `dynamic-action-laws` - extreme dynamic positioning following Steranko's codified "laws of action" with over-the-top movement
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` - radical composition redesign for maximum visual impact
- **Material Physics Authority:** Commercial printing techniques and advertising design specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Comic cover impact viewing distance affects graphic element sizing and typography integration.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1960s four-color printing pushed to maximum sophistication with innovative layout experimentation.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to completely break traditional comic book layout conventions.
- **Revolutionary Techniques Flag:** `conventional-comic-prohibition` - mandatory rejection of standard superhero comic approaches.

## Jim Steranko

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

Analyze the provided portrait(s). Redraw the subject entirely from scratch in **Jim Steranko's distinctive Silver Age comic cover style**.

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Preserve likeness with **pop art glamorization** - recognizable but transformed through Steranko's psychedelic, poster-art influenced design sensibility.
- **Timeframe**: Steranko's revolutionary Marvel period (1966-1968) including Nick Fury, Strange Tales, and X-Men work.
- **Degree of likeness**: Pop art stylized - maintain features but interpret through graphic design and advertising art influences.
- **Emotional tone**: Psychedelic sophistication, spy thriller coolness, pop art energy, avant-garde experimentation.
- **Pose conventions**: Graphic design influenced poses, extreme dynamic action, pop art compositions, advertising layout arrangements.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original VERTEX COMICS character design avoiding Marvel copyrighted elements.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `graphic-design-precision`
- **Pose Flag:** `dynamic-action-laws`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Graphic design innovation and visual experimentation dominate over traditional comic book conventions.

The final result must capture Steranko's unique fusion of comics art with graphic design and advertising sophistication.
