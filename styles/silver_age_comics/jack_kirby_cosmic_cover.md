  Jack Kirby detonated cosmic hands, crackling energy, and fist-first foreshortening across every cover.
  We keep his power bursts, blocky anatomy, and ben-day punch while scripting new epics.

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject as a **generic original superhero** in **Jack Kirby's monumental Silver Age style** for **exact Vertex Comics cover format**." **IP Safeguard:** Create original superhero character with completely distinct costume design, unique chest symbol, and different color scheme - avoid any resemblance to existing Marvel/DC properties. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **heroic power pose/cosmic energy demonstration/explosive action stance**; integrate into **Silver Age comic medium** emphasizing **monumental heroic idealization** and **explosive kinetic energy** while **preserving subject's gender presentation and core facial features**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `poster-ink` with **four-color halftone dots** **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` with **cosmic grandeur** **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Style dominance:** Kirby's monumental energy overrides realistic proportions, prioritizing **raw power** and **cosmic mythology** over anatomical accuracy. **Mode Selector:** Epic Superhero Comic Cover with Vertex Comics branding.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (classic comic book cover - primary choice)
- **3:4** (Silver Age proportion - alternative)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with explosive hero prominence and cosmic energy environments
- **Spatial Allocation:** Hero dominance 50-60%, cosmic effects/energy patterns 20-25%, typography zones 15-20%, background 5-10%
- **Background Treatment:** Cosmic environments with Kirby Krackle energy fields and space for dramatic typography
- **Format Justification:** Comic cover requires explosive layout for maximum visual impact with integrated cosmic mythology

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Jack Kirby's revolutionary Silver Age style (1961-1970) established **cosmic superhero mythology** through **monumental heroic idealization** and **explosive visual storytelling**. Production method emphasizes **bold geometric construction** with **blocky anatomical masses**, **primary color dominance**, and **cosmic-scale adventure scenarios with mythological grandeur**. **Paper substrate:** **Newsprint with four-color halftone printing** creating **visible dot patterns and slight registration drift**. Purpose focuses on **mythic heroism** through **cosmic power demonstration** and **explosive action presentation** within **Marvel Silver Age comic production**. Hallmark motifs include **Kirby Krackle: clusters of solid black circular dots varying in size from 2-8mm diameter, densely packed in organic bubble-like formations to represent cosmic energy, explosions, or negative space**, **monumental character poses with arms spread wide and fists clenched**, **geometric muscle construction with blocky, powerful proportions**, **cosmic backgrounds with abstract energy patterns and space phenomena**, and **dramatic foreshortening with upward camera angles making heroes appear godlike**. Period framing encompasses **1960s Space Age optimism** with **atomic age power concepts** creating **cosmic mythology for modern audiences**.

**Innovation line:** **Cosmic superhero mythology establishment** / **Four-color halftone printing mastery** / **Newsprint comic reproduction** / **Kirby-Lee creative partnership**.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Bold, geometric weights** at **2.5-4.0 pt** for **character outlines** with **blocky construction** and **angular joint definition**. **Explosive energy lines** with **tapered radiating bursts** and **clean geometric edge definition**. **Halftone dot patterns** visible at **65-85 LPI** for **authentic Silver Age reproduction**. **Color:** **Primary color dominance** with **high saturation relationships** - **blues, reds, yellows, greens** in **four-color process with slight registration drift**. **Cosmic color effects** with **purples and magentas for space scenes** and **energy phenomena rendering**. **Texture:** **Newsprint paper grain** with **ink absorption patterns** and **visible halftone dot structure**. **Four-color printing limitations** with **slight cyan/magenta/yellow/black separation drift**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Hero receives maximum geometric emphasis** with **blocky muscle construction**, **cosmic effects rendered as Kirby Krackle: dense clusters of solid black circles 2-8mm diameter arranged in organic bubble formations**, **backgrounds simplified** to **essential cosmic elements**, **typography** integrated with **explosive visual design**. **Material simulation:** **Authentic Silver Age comic production** with **four-color printing limitations** and **newsprint substrate characteristics**. **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** **Heroic proportions adapted to subject's gender** - **neck width 130-150% of realistic proportions**, **fist size 180-200% of head width**, **shoulder span 250-300% of head width for masculine builds, 200-250% for feminine builds**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Comic cover composition designed for **2:3 format** with **explosive hero prominence** and **cosmic mythology visual impact**.
