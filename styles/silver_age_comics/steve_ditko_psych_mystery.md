  Steve Ditko warped perspective into mystic portals, split screens, and paranoid figurework.
  We keep his nervous line, spiral vistas, and asymmetric compositions while conjuring new villains.

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject as a **generic original superhero** in **Steve Ditko's distinctive Silver Age style** for **exact Vertex Comics cover format**." **IP Safeguard:** Create original superhero character with completely distinct costume design, unique power set, and different visual elements - avoid any resemblance to existing Marvel/DC properties, especially Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, or Question elements. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **angular expressive pose/neurotic intensity/awkward heroic stance** while **preserving subject's gender presentation and core facial features**; integrate into **Silver Age comic medium** emphasizing **psychological complexity** and **expressive distortion**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` with **angular construction** **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` with **expressive distortion** **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Style dominance:** Ditko's expressive intensity overrides conventional heroic poses, prioritizing **emotional authenticity** and **psychological depth** over idealized presentation. **Mode Selector:** Psychologically Complex Superhero Comic with Vertex Comics branding.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (classic comic book cover - primary choice)
- **3:4** (Silver Age proportion - alternative)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with angular hero prominence and psychologically charged environments
- **Spatial Allocation:** Hero dominance 50-60%, environmental/abstract elements 20-25%, typography zones 15-20%, negative space 5-10%
- **Background Treatment:** Dual-mode environments - either hyper-real urban settings OR abstract psychedelic dimensions with minimal right angles
- **Format Justification:** Comic cover requires psychological layout for maximum emotional impact with integrated surreal or urban elements

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Steve Ditko's revolutionary Silver Age style (1962-1966) established **psychological superhero storytelling** through **angular expressive distortion** and **neurotic character intensity**. Production method emphasizes **precise pen and ink technique** with **geometric angular construction**, **imperfect anatomical proportions**, and **dual-reality visual approaches combining gritty urban realism with surreal psychedelic abstraction**. **Paper substrate:** **Standard newsprint with four-color printing creating distinctive color separations and slight registration drift**. Purpose focuses on **internal character conflict** through **psychological visual storytelling** and **expressive emotional presentation** within **Marvel Silver Age comic production**. Hallmark motifs include **expressively gesticulating hands with fingers pointing in all directions, splayed wide or forming dramatic poses**, **angular geometric body construction with deliberately imperfect, neurotic proportions for males, fuller-figured but still angular construction for females**, **distinctive female features: prominent eyes with heavy eyelashes 150-200% normal size, wavy/curly hair rendered with individual strand definition, rounded but geometric facial construction**, **dual environmental approaches: hyper-real New York urban settings with detailed architecture OR abstract psychedelic dimensions with curved, squiggly design elements and no right angles**, **webbing and cobweb patterns as recurring visual motifs in geometric or organic arrangements**, and **close-up panels focusing on intense, calm yet penetrating eyes with dramatic emotional emphasis**. Period framing encompasses **1960s psychological complexity** with **counterculture mysticism** creating **neurotic but authentic superhero drama**.

**Innovation line:** **Psychological complexity integration** / **Expressive distortion mastery** / **Dual-reality visual storytelling** / **Ditko-Lee Marvel Method collaboration**.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Angular, geometric weights** at **1.0-2.0 pt** for **character outlines** with **precise pen construction** and **deliberately awkward anatomical proportions**. **Expressive distortion technique** with **angular joint definition** and **neurotic edge quality**. **Superior pen and ink reproduction** optimized for **Silver Age printing**. **Color:** **Distinctive Silver Age palette** with **psychological color relationships** - **blues, reds, greens, purples** in **four-color process with visible registration separation**. **Contrasting approaches: realistic urban colors OR psychedelic mystical combinations with otherworldly palettes**. **Texture:** **Standard newsprint** with **four-color halftone patterns** and **slight registration drift**. **Pen and ink surface quality** with **crosshatching patterns** and **angular texture treatment**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Hands receive maximum expressive emphasis** with **individual finger definition and dramatic gesticulation**, **faces focus on intense eye contact** with **angular facial construction**, **bodies constructed from geometric shapes** with **deliberately imperfect proportions**, **environments shift between hyper-detailed urban accuracy and abstract psychedelic minimalism**. **Material simulation:** **1960s Silver Age comic production** with **pen and ink precision** and **four-color printing characteristics**. **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** **Psychological proportions adapted to subject's gender** - **deliberately imperfect anatomy: elongated limbs 110-125% realistic length, angular joints emphasized, hands enlarged 120-140% for expressive gesticulation**; **Male figures: scrawny, awkward build with prominent angular joints, neurotic intensity**; **Female figures: distinctive Ditko approach - fuller figured but still angular construction, prominent eyes with heavy eyelashes 150-200% normal size, wavy/curly hair rendered with individual strand definition, rounded but geometric facial features, avoiding both glamour idealization and complete awkwardness**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Comic cover composition designed for **2:3 format** with **psychological character prominence** and **dual-reality environmental approach**.
