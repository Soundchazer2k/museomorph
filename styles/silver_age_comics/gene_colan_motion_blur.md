## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via atmospheric mood and cinematic gesture unless photographic.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("shadow coverage 60-70%", "pencil weight 2H-4B range") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `atmospheric-pencil` - soft pencil rendering with dramatic shadow modeling and film noir lighting influence
- **Pose Flag:** `cinematic-flow` - dynamic movement captured mid-action with flowing, organic positioning
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` - extend atmospheric backgrounds to fill new canvas dimensions
- **Material Physics Authority:** Pencil graphite density and newsprint absorption characteristics override aesthetic preferences.
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Comic cover viewing distance affects shadow weight and atmospheric detail hierarchy.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1960s-1970s four-color printing with characteristic dot patterns and registration drift.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to prioritize atmospheric mood over traditional superhero clarity.
- **Revolutionary Techniques Flag:** `comfort-violation-authorized` for psychologically intense shadow work.

## Gene Colan

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

Analyze the provided portrait(s). Redraw the subject entirely from scratch in **Gene Colan's distinctive Silver Age comic cover style**.

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Preserve likeness with **atmospheric moodiness** - recognizable but enhanced through Colan's signature shadowy, film noir-influenced rendering.
- **Timeframe**: Colan's Marvel Silver Age period (1966-1979) including Daredevil, Iron Man, Captain America, and Tomb of Dracula.
- **Degree of likeness**: Atmospherically enhanced - maintain features but interpret through dramatic lighting and shadow play.
- **Emotional tone**: Film noir moodiness, psychological depth, urban sophistication, romantic tension.
- **Pose conventions**: Dynamic movement, flowing action, dramatic lighting effects, cinematic angles.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original VERTEX COMICS character design avoiding Marvel copyrighted elements.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `atmospheric-pencil`
- **Pose Flag:** `cinematic-flow`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend`
- **Style Dominance:** Atmospheric storytelling and cinematic sophistication dominate over traditional comic book clarity.

The final result must capture Colan's unique cinematic vision and atmospheric storytelling mastery.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `2:3` (standard comic cover format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** extend-atmospheric-background
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject placement in dynamic 40-60% coverage with atmospheric environment integration
- **Background Treatment:** Fill canvas with swirling shadows, urban environments, or cosmic atmospheric effects
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 ratio serves Colan's preference for cinematic vertical compositions with dramatic staging

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

The artwork must be created in **Gene Colan's signature Silver Age style** (1966-1979), capturing the aesthetic principles of "The Dean" - the artist who brought cinematic sophistication to comics. Channel Colan's background in advertising illustration and his innovative approach to atmospheric storytelling.

**Intended medium**: Four-color process printing on newsprint, designed for cinematic impact and sophisticated visual narrative.

**Purpose**: Comic book cover emphasizing mood, atmosphere, and sophisticated visual storytelling through lighting and composition.

**Key influences**:

- Film noir and Hollywood cinematography (especially 1940s black and white films)
- Advertising illustration techniques and commercial art sophistication
- European art cinema and jazz music improvisational approaches
- Norman Rockwell's humanistic character portrayal
- Milton Caniff's shadow work and dramatic contrast

**Thematic purpose**: Elevate comic book art through cinematic storytelling and psychological depth.

**5 hallmark motifs with quantified specifications**:

1. **Swirling shadow patterns** covering 60-70% of composition with organic, flowing movement
2. **Atmospheric gradation** using 2H-4B pencil weight range for subtle tonal transitions
3. **Cinematic lighting angles** with 45-degree key light positioning and dramatic rim lighting
4. **Flowing organic linework** with 3-5mm line weight variation suggesting movement and life
5. **Urban environmental integration** with 40% background atmospheric detail supporting narrative mood

**Period framing**: Marvel Silver Age sophistication (1966-1979) bringing adult cinematic sensibilities to superhero comics.

**Tone Tag**: Sophisticated moodiness, psychological complexity, cinematic atmosphere.

**Production Era Authenticity**: 1960s-1970s newsprint four-color printing with characteristic halftone dots, slight color registration drift, and paper grain texture affecting shadow reproduction.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work / Rendering:**

- **Flowing, organic linework** suggesting movement and life with 3-5mm weight variation
- **Atmospheric shadow play** covering 60-70% of composition with dramatic lighting effects
- **Pencil-first approach** treating pencil as primary artistic tool rather than preliminary sketch
- **Cinematic composition** with sophisticated camera angle simulation and depth staging
- **Soft gradation technique** using 2H-4B pencil range for subtle atmospheric transitions
- **Jazz-like improvisation** in mark-making with spontaneous, intuitive line placement

**Coloring:**

- **Moody, atmospheric color palette** emphasizing shadows and highlights with muted sophistication
- **Film noir color sensibility** - limited warm/cool palette with maximum atmospheric impact
- **Sophisticated color relationships** serving narrative mood over decorative appeal
- **Subtle gradation effects** within four-color printing limitations using dot pattern variation
- **Urban color schemes** - deep blues, warm yellows, muted reds reflecting city lighting
- **Romantic and mysterious combinations** supporting emotional narrative content

**Texture:**

- **Atmospheric, filmic surface quality** simulating cinematic lighting effects
- **Newsprint absorption characteristics** affecting shadow density and line weight rendering
- **Period-authentic halftone patterns** with 65-85 LPI dot screens typical of 1960s-1970s comic printing
- **Subtle registration drift** of 0.5-1mm creating characteristic Silver Age printing artifacts
- **Paper grain texture** affecting fine detail reproduction and shadow gradation

**Pose Anchors:**

- **Dynamic flow positioning** with 15-25 degree torso angles suggesting movement
- **Cinematic gesture economy** with expressive hand positioning and dramatic staging
- **Atmospheric integration** where figure and environment flow together seamlessly
- **Film noir influenced** dramatic angle choices and sophisticated framing

**Scale Hierarchy:** Proportional measurements emphasizing atmospheric mood over anatomical precision (shadow coverage 60-70%, highlight definition 20-30% of total composition)

**Material Authenticity:** Authentic pencil-on-paper techniques with newsprint printing characteristics - no digital simulation

**Period Consistency:** All elements historically coherent with 1960s-1970s Marvel production methods and artistic sophistication

**Production Method:** Four-color process printing with period-appropriate halftone screens, color separation limitations, and newsprint absorption effects

**Canvas Adaptation:** Composition optimized for 2:3 comic cover format with cinematic staging principles
