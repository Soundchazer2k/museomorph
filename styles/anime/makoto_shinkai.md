about: >
  Makoto Shinkai paints luminous skies and hyper-detailed streets where light
  meets emotion. Filmic lens flares, blue-orange palettes, and realistic weather
  make every frame feel like a photograph touched by wonder. MuseoMorph keeps
  that atmosphere while ensuring props and stories remain original and safe.

# Makoto Shinkai Style - Photorealistic Poetry


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **16:9 environmental panorama** or **2:3 character-environment** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject in **Makoto Shinkai's photorealistic poetry** style for **exact format specification**." **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **realistic silhouette/natural gesture/subtle expression**; integrate into **photorealistic background** with **anime character** hybrid medium emphasizing **environmental storytelling**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `diffusion-soft` **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style dominance:** Shinkai's photorealistic environmental approach overrides conventional anime backgrounds while maintaining **subtle anime character stylization**. **Gender respect:** Honor presented gender while maintaining Shinkai's **realistic human proportions** and **natural character design**. **IP guardrail:** Archetypes only; no direct references to Your Name, Weathering With You, 5 Centimeters per Second, or other Shinkai properties. **Mode Selector:** Choose [Environmental Portrait] or [Atmospheric Scene] per image.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **16:9** (environmental storytelling emphasis)
- **2:3** (character-environment integration)
- **21:9** (ultra-wide atmospheric panorama)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with photorealistic environmental expansion
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned within vast environmental context (environmental dominance with character integration)
- **Background Treatment:** Extend 4K-8K photorealistic environments (skies, urban landscapes, natural settings) with atmospheric depth
- **Format Justification:** Shinkai's environmental poetry philosophy supports wide formats for atmospheric storytelling while maintaining character connection to setting

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Makoto Shinkai's distinctive approach (1996-present) combines **photorealistic backgrounds** with **subtle anime character integration** through **meticulous environmental detail** and **atmospheric lighting mastery**. Production method emphasizes **4K-8K background resolution** later downsampled, using **photo referencing** with **heavy digital painting overlay** and **custom brush creation** from **desaturated, inverted photographs**. Purpose focuses on **environmental storytelling** through **atmospheric mood** and **natural light behavior**. Hallmark motifs include **signature lens flares, blue-orange color contrasts, atmospheric glow effects, detailed cloud rendering,** and **natural light simulation following realistic physics**. Period framing encompasses **contemporary Japanese settings** with **idealized natural beauty** creating **aspirational environmental realism**.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Minimal character outlining** at **0.3-0.7 pt** with **soft, organic curves** following **natural form**; **environmental elements** use **photorealistic edge definition** without **hard line work**. **Character integration** through **subtle outline work** that **doesn't break environmental realism**. **Color:** **Blue-orange dominated palette** at **70-80% saturation** with **signature color combinations**: **atmospheric blues (#6e7f80, #304451, #708090)**, **warm sunset oranges (#ff8c42, #ffa726)**, **natural skin tones** with **subtle pink undertones**. **Environmental color temperature shifts** following **realistic atmospheric perspective**. **Texture:** **Photorealistic background rendering** with **atmospheric glow effects** using **15-30% opacity layers** and **soft round brush techniques**. **Natural light simulation** with **rim lighting on clouds** and **color temperature gradients**. **Character skin** with **subtle realistic texture** avoiding **anime flatness**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Environmental backgrounds** receive **maximum photorealistic detail**, **character faces** with **realistic proportions** but **slightly enlarged eyes**, **clothing** with **realistic fabric behavior** and **environmental light reflection**. **Material simulation:** **4K-8K background detail** with **digital painting overlay**. **Screen blending modes** for **additive glow effects** along **horizons and light sources**. **Atmospheric perspective** through **color temperature shifts** and **detail reduction** with **distance**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Environmental photorealism extends seamlessly within declared aspect ratio, with character naturally integrated into atmospheric storytelling. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 60-75%, chaos to 10-20%, CFG scale 8-11 for **realistic-anime balance**.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **Contemporary Japanese fashion** with **realistic proportions**, **practical hemlines** for **daily activities**, **natural necklines** without **anime exaggeration**, **seasonal appropriateness**, ornament scale **0-2** (realistic accessories, natural jewelry); hair & makeup scale **0-1** (natural, realistic styling); **practical footwear** appropriate to **environmental setting**.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Contemporary casual** or **business casual** wear with **realistic fit**, **seasonal appropriateness**, **minimal formal elements** unless **environmentally justified**; jewelry **0-1** pieces (realistic, understated); **natural styling** throughout.
- **Youth (girls/boys):** **School uniforms** or **age-appropriate casual wear** with **realistic proportions**; **no stylized anime elements**; **practical footwear**; **no makeup**; **age-appropriate environmental interaction**.
- **Fabric behavior:** **Realistic drape physics** following **actual material properties**. **Environmental interaction** showing **wind effects**, **weather influence**, and **realistic wear patterns**. **Natural material textures** with **photorealistic rendering**.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [smartphone, shoulder bag, umbrella, bicycle, camera, book]
  occasional: [musical instrument, art supplies, sports equipment, travel gear]
  rare: [professional equipment, specialized hobby gear]
  micro: [keychain, small accessory, personal item, seasonal object]
  exclusions:
    - "no fantasy or supernatural items"
    - "no anime-specific objects"
    - "no unrealistic proportions"
  dependencies:
    - "all props must match realistic contemporary Japanese life"
    - "seasonal items require appropriate environmental context"
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:** "original aspect ratio", "conventional anime exaggerations", "fantasy elements"; **NO unrealistic hair or eye colors**; **NO anime-specific clothing styles**; **NO hard cel-shading that breaks environmental realism**. **✅ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "photorealistic environmental integration"; **Natural atmospheric lighting** with **identifiable sources**; **Realistic human proportions**; **Natural color harmony**; **Atmospheric depth effects**.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 16:9 Environmental:** Maximum environmental storytelling with character naturally integrated
- **For 2:3 Character-Environment:** Balanced character-environment relationship with atmospheric context
- **For 21:9 Ultra-wide:** Panoramic atmospheric storytelling with vast environmental scope

**Staging:** Subjects positioned within **highly detailed photorealistic environments** showing **natural interaction** with **atmospheric conditions**. **Camera/perspective:** **Natural eye-level perspectives** with **slight environmental drama** through **atmospheric effects**. **Background density:** **Maximum photorealistic detail** with **atmospheric perspective** and **environmental storytelling priority**. **Surface Context Anchor:** Photorealistic digital painting surface appropriate to environmental poetry **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Environmental storytelling extends naturally within declared ratio while maintaining character-environment connection.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit - **Not authentic** to Shinkai's cinematic approach for static images; **omit all embedded text**. Shinkai emphasizes **pure visual environmental storytelling**.
