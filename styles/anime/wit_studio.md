# Wit Studio Style - Dynamic Action Cinematography

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **16:9 action cinematic** or **3:4 dynamic portrait** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL CLEAN ANIMATION DOMINANCE:** Wit Studio's kinetic animation excellence overrides ALL comic book illustration, superhero art, and over-rendered action effects. **COMPLETE CLEAN CEL ANIMATION WITH SPATIAL MASTERY REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Wit Studio clean kinetic animation** for **exact format specification** - NOT comic book illustration, superhero art, or over-rendered action effects." **Anti-Comic-Book Priority:** **NO comic book illustration effects, superhero gradient rendering, or over-rendered action sequences that break animation aesthetic.** **Completely redraw using clean cel animation medium with spatial depth mastery and multi-plane environmental integration.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `anime-precision` **Pose Flag:** `foreshortened-diagonal` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Animation Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must look like clean animation character with spatial awareness and kinetic potential, not comic book or illustration art.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Action Portrait] or [Kinetic Scene] per image.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **16:9** (action cinematography standard)
- **3:4** (dynamic character emphasis)
- **2:3** (vertical action composition)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with kinetic spatial emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for maximum spatial depth and kinetic energy (multi-plane positioning, environmental interaction)
- **Background Treatment:** Multi-plane environments with clean animation depth and spatial relationship clarity
- **Format Justification:** Wit Studio's spatial mastery requires dynamic ratios supporting movement potential and environmental integration within clean animation framework

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Wit Studio's distinctive approach (2012-present) pioneered **kinetic animation excellence** through **clean spatial depth mastery** and **multi-plane environmental integration**. Production method emphasizes **clean cel animation** with **3D space utilization**, **multi-plane background depth**, **realistic spatial relationships**, and **kinetic energy potential** within **traditional animation framework**. Purpose centers on **action storytelling** through **spatial dynamics** and **environmental interaction** using **clean animation techniques**. Hallmark motifs include **multi-plane scrolling depth**, **clean spatial relationship clarity**, **kinetic energy visualization through animation**, **environmental interaction emphasis**, **realistic spatial scaling**, and **clean animation movement potential**. Period framing encompasses **action-driven narratives** with **spatial visual language** creating **kinetic animation storytelling** within **clean cel animation medium**.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Clean animation precision weights** ranging **0.8-1.8 pt** based on **spatial depth** and **kinetic emphasis** while maintaining **clean animation line quality**. **No comic book illustration line work or over-rendered action effects**. **Environmental line work** shows **spatial precision** with **clean geometric construction**. **Color:** **Clean cel animation color schemes** at **75-85% saturation** with **spatial depth color coding** and **multi-plane atmospheric perspective**. **Clean color separation boundaries** without **comic book gradient effects** or **superhero illustration rendering**. **Environmental color layering** for **spatial depth clarity**. **Texture:** **Clean cel animation surface** with **spatial texture variation** and **multi-plane environmental detail**. **NO comic book illustration textures, superhero effects, or over-rendered action sequences**. **Clean animation fabric behavior** and **environmental surface accuracy**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Clean anime character proportions** with **athletic action-ready emphasis** and **spatial relationship awareness**. **Multi-plane environmental backgrounds** with **clean animation precision** and **spatial depth clarity**. **Character positioning** shows **natural environmental interaction**. **Material simulation:** **Clean cel animation production** with **spatial depth mastery** and **multi-plane environmental integration**. **Clean animation lighting** with **spatial logic** - **NO comic book effects or illustration rendering**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Clean animation composition utilizes spatial depth principles optimized for declared aspect ratio with kinetic energy emphasis within animation framework. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 75-85%, chaos to 15-25%, CFG scale 10-14 for **clean animation precision** with **spatial depth mastery**.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **Action-ready clothing** with **clean animation rendering**, **movement-friendly cuts** and **practical styling**, **athletic proportions** supporting **dynamic activity** within **clean animation aesthetic**, ornament scale **1-2** (practical accessories, action gear); hair & makeup scale **0-1** (practical styling for **movement potential**); **athletic footwear** rendered in **clean animation style**.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Action-oriented fashion** with **clean animation precision**, **athletic styling** and **practical design elements** within **animation framework**; accessories **0-2** pieces (action gear, practical items); **athletic readiness aesthetic** using **clean animation techniques**.
- **Youth (girls/boys):** **Active wear** or **movement-friendly clothing** with **clean animation color application**; **athletic footwear** appropriate for **dynamic activity**; **practical styling** supporting **kinetic potential**.
- **Fabric behavior:** **Clean animation fabric logic** with **realistic movement physics** and **athletic fabric behavior** rendered in **animation style**.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [action equipment, athletic gear, dynamic tool, movement accessory, kinetic device]
  occasional: [specialized action equipment, dynamic technology, athletic enhancement gear]
  rare: [advanced action gear, kinetic mastery tool, dynamic specialization equipment]
  micro: [action detail, movement indicator, athletic accessory, dynamic element]
  exclusions:
    - "no comic book superhero props inappropriate to clean animation"
    - "no over-rendered objects that break animation aesthetic"
  dependencies:
    - "all props must be rendered in clean animation style"
    - "action readiness and movement potential required"
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:** "comic book illustration effects", "superhero gradient rendering", "over-rendered action sequences"; **NO comic book art style that breaks animation aesthetic**; **NO superhero illustration techniques inappropriate to animation medium**; **NO over-rendered effects that eliminate clean animation clarity**. **✅ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "clean kinetic animation"; **Clean cel animation precision** with **spatial depth mastery**; **Multi-plane environmental integration** within **animation framework**; **Kinetic energy potential** through **clean animation techniques**; **Spatial relationship clarity** with **environmental interaction**.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 16:9 Action:** Kinetic horizontal emphasis with multi-plane action potential and clean animation depth
- **For 3:4 Dynamic:** Dynamic vertical action with spatial depth integration and clean animation precision
- **For 2:3 Vertical:** Vertical action emphasis with kinetic energy focus within animation framework

**Staging:** Subjects positioned with **kinetic spatial emphasis** showing **action potential** and **environmental interaction** within **clean multi-plane animation environments**. **Background density:** **Multi-plane animation backgrounds** with **spatial depth precision** and **clean environmental integration**. **Surface Context Anchor:** Clean animation production surface appropriate to kinetic spatial storytelling **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Clean animation spatial dynamics extend naturally within declared ratio while maintaining kinetic character focus and environmental integration.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit - **Not authentic** to Wit Studio's clean animation approach; **omit all embedded text**. Wit Studio emphasizes **spatial storytelling** through **clean kinetic composition** and **multi-plane environmental integration**.
