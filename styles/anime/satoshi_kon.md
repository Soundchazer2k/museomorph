# Satoshi Kon Style - Hyperrealistic Animation Psychology


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **16:9 cinematic frame** or **2:3 psychological study** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL ANIMATION MEDIUM DOMINANCE:** Satoshi Kon's hyperrealistic 2D animation aesthetic overrides ALL photorealistic rendering and digital painting approaches. **COMPLETE 2D ANIMATION WITH LIVE-ACTION DETAIL REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Satoshi Kon hyperrealistic 2D animation character** for **exact format specification** - NOT photorealistic digital painting or 3D rendering." **Anti-Photorealism Priority:** **NO photorealistic 3D rendering, digital painting smoothness, or gradient lighting effects.** **Completely redraw using 2D cel animation medium with hyperrealistic detail within animation framework.** Identity through **psychological depth and cinematic composition only, NOT photographic accuracy.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `painterly-contour` **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Animation Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must look like hyperdetailed 2D animation cel, not digital painting or photograph.** **Complete conversion to cel animation medium with live-action quality detail.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Psychological Portrait], [Cinematic Study], or [Urban Context] per image.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **16:9** (cinematic psychological framing)
- **2:3** (psychological character study)
- **3:4** (traditional with psychological depth)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with cinematic psychological emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for psychological narrative impact (match-cut potential, reality-blend integration)
- **Background Treatment:** Hyperdetailed urban environments using flat color layering maintaining animation medium integrity
- **Format Justification:** Kon's cinematic animation requires precise framing that supports psychological storytelling and match-cut composition potential

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Satoshi Kon's revolutionary approach (1963-2010) achieved **"hyperrealistic animation"** through **2D cel animation with live-action detail levels** and **psychological depth integration**. Production method emphasizes **clean animation line work** with **flat cel shading containing hyperrealistic detail**, **cinematic lighting within animation constraints**, and **psychological color coding**. Purpose centers on **adult psychological storytelling** through **cinematic composition** and **reality-fantasy visual integration**. Hallmark motifs include **clean animation lines with live-action detail, deep saturated psychological colors, flat cel backgrounds with architectural complexity, match-cut composition potential,** and **reality-blend visual layering within animation medium**. Period framing encompasses **contemporary urban Japanese settings** with **psychological complexity** creating **2D animation with cinematic sophistication**.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Clean animation line weights** at **0.4-1.0 pt** with **precise cel animation quality** and **consistent outline definition**; interior details **0.2-0.6 pt** for **hyperrealistic detail within animation framework**. **Sharp, clean animation strokes** with **technical precision** but **NO photorealistic blending or soft gradients**. **Color:** **Deep saturated palette** at **80-95% intensity** with **psychological color coding** - **emotional reds for psychological tension (#dc143c)**, **urban blues for reality anchoring (#1e3a8a)**, **warm yellows for memory/fantasy (#ffd700)**. **Flat cel-shading** with **bold color temperature contrasts** and **clear color separation boundaries**. **NO gradient effects or realistic lighting simulation**. **Texture:** **Clean cel animation surface** with **hyperrealistic detail rendering within flat color areas**. **NO gradient smoothness or digital painting effects** - maintain **strict animation medium integrity** while achieving **live-action detail quality**. **Urban atmospheric complexity** through **strategic flat color layering**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Realistic bone structure and aging effects** within **animation character design**, **psychological expression complexity** through **cel animation techniques**, **hyperdetailed urban backgrounds** using **flat color layering**, **clothing** with **realistic wear patterns** rendered in **clean cel animation style**. **Material simulation:** **Pure cel animation production** with **hyperrealistic detail integration**. **Clean color fills** with **precise registration**. **Cinematic lighting effects** achieved through **strategic flat color placement** rather than **realistic gradient rendering**. **Urban environmental complexity** through **layered animation backgrounds only**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Hyperrealistic 2D animation composition optimized for declared aspect ratio with cinematic psychological storytelling emphasis. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 70-85%, chaos to 5-15%, CFG scale 10-13 for **animation medium precision** with **hyperrealistic detail integration**.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **Contemporary Japanese professional wear** with **realistic aging and wear patterns**, **practical urban clothing** for **adult city life**, **sophisticated color coordination** supporting **psychological narrative**, ornament scale **1-2** (realistic accessories, urban professional items); hair & makeup scale **1-2** (realistic urban styling with **psychological significance**); **practical urban footwear** showing **realistic wear**.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Urban professional clothing** with **realistic fabric behavior** and **environmental wear**, **contemporary Japanese business or casual wear**, **color choices** reflecting **psychological state**; jewelry **0-1** pieces (realistic, psychologically significant); **mature urban professional aesthetic**.
- **Youth (girls/boys):** **Contemporary Japanese school** or **casual wear** with **age-appropriate realism**; **practical urban footwear**; **minimal makeup** appropriate to **urban contemporary context**; **age-appropriate psychological complexity**.
- **Fabric behavior:** **Realistic drape and wear patterns** rendered in **cel animation style**. **Environmental interaction** showing **urban life effects** on **clothing condition**. **Psychological color significance** in **fabric choices**.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [cell phone, urban transit card, coffee cup, cigarette pack, personal notebook]
  occasional: [camera, psychological artifact, mirror, photograph, urban technology]
  rare: [symbolic object, memory trigger, reality-blend item, psychological symbol]
  micro: [small personal item, urban detail, psychological anchor, reality marker]
  exclusions:
    - "no fantasy or supernatural items unless psychologically motivated"
    - "no cute or decorative objects inappropriate to urban adult themes"
    - "choose-one based on psychological narrative relevance"
  dependencies:
    - "all props must support psychological narrative depth"
    - "urban contemporary context required for authenticity"
    - "props should suggest character psychological state"
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:** "photorealistic 3D rendering", "digital painting smoothness", "gradient lighting simulation"; **NO cute or moe aesthetic elements inappropriate to adult psychological themes**; **NO fantasy elements without psychological justification**; **NO soft digital blending or photographic textures**. **✅ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "hyperrealistic 2D animation"; **Clean animation line work** with **hyperrealistic detail integration**; **Flat cel-shading** with **deep color saturation**; **Psychological depth through animation techniques**; **Cinematic composition**.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 16:9 Cinematic:** Cinematic framing supporting psychological narrative and match-cut potential
- **For 2:3 Psychological:** Character psychological study with urban environmental context
- **For 3:4 Traditional:** Classic format with Kon's hyperrealistic animation treatment

**Staging:** Subjects positioned within **cinematic framing** supporting **psychological narrative** and **match-cut composition potential**. **Camera/perspective:** **Cinematic angles** including **close-ups for psychological intensity**, **medium shots for character interaction**, **wide shots for urban environmental context**. **Background density:** **Hyperdetailed urban environments** using **flat color layering** maintaining **animation medium integrity** supporting **psychological narrative**. **Surface Context Anchor:** Hyperrealistic 2D animation production surface appropriate to psychological storytelling **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Cinematic psychological environments extend naturally within declared ratio while maintaining animation medium integrity.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit - **Not authentic** to Kon's cinematic animation approach for static portraits; **omit all embedded text**. Kon emphasizes **pure visual psychological storytelling** through **cinematic animation composition**.
