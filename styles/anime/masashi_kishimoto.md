  Weekly Shonen Jump battle art thrives on bold line work, kinetic poses, and
  emotional stakes. Masashi Kishimoto's Naruto-era approach pairs confident inks
  with chakra-charged color and symbolic auras. MuseoMorph channels that
  intensity while keeping violence stylized and wardrobe functional.

# Naruto/Shonen Style - Dynamic Energy


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 poster format** or **3:4 portrait** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject in **Naruto/Weekly Shonen Jump** battle manga animation style for **exact format specification**." **Face-Treatment Flag:** `poster-ink` **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Mode Selector:** Choose [Action Portrait] or [Power-Up Scene] per image.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (manga cover/poster format)
- **3:4** (character portrait)
- **16:9** (action sequence)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with dynamic action emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for maximum heroic impact (lower-third for title space in poster mode)
- **Background Treatment:** Simplified energy backgrounds, speed lines extending to canvas edges
- **Format Justification:** Shonen manga cover traditions require vertical emphasis for dynamic character presentation

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Weekly Shonen Jump's influential aesthetic (1968-present) emphasizes **bold character designs** supporting **dynamic action sequences** and **emotional intensity**. Production method combines **hand-drawn key animation** with **digital coloring and compositing**, maintaining manga's high-contrast line art translated to motion. Hallmark motifs include **gravity-defying hair designs, oversized eyes expressing determination, speed lines and impact frames, transformation sequences,** and **symbolic power auras**.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** Bold outer contours **2.5-3.5 pt** with confident, angular strokes; interior details **0.8-1.5 pt** emphasizing feature definition. Sharp, geometric accent lines for impact moments. **Color:** High-saturation palette at **90-95% intensity** with maximum brightness reserved for power/emotional moments. Shonen signature colors: determination orange (#ff6b35), power blue (#4169e1), energy yellow (#ffd700). **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Dynamic composition optimized for declared aspect ratio with speed lines and energy effects extending to canvas boundaries.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** Practical combat wear or modified traditional garments, hemlines practical for movement, fitted but non-revealing tops with mesh/armor accents, functional accessories.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** Combat-ready clothing with layered complexity, high-collar jackets or open vests, cargo pants or wrapped leg gear, asymmetrical design elements.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [kunai knife, shuriken, scroll, headband, training weight]
  occasional: [chakra-infused weapon, summoning contract, soldier pill]
  rare: [legendary artifact, special clan weapon, tailed beast item]
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:** "original framing", "passive expressions", "modern civilian clothing"; **NO photorealistic rendering**; **NO melancholy expressions**. **✅ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "dynamic action composition"; **Bold color contrasts**; **Sharp shadow definition**; **Energetic hair movement**.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 2:3 Poster:** Vertical action emphasis with title space consideration
- **For 3:4 Portrait:** Character dominance with simplified energy background
- **For 16:9 Action:** Horizontal dynamic movement with environmental context

**Staging:** Subjects positioned in **dynamic action poses** showing readiness for challenge. **Background density:** Simplified to support character prominence with motion blur effects.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit - **Not typically authentic** to anime portraits; **omit embedded text** unless creating manga-style panel.
