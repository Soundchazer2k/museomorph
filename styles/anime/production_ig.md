  Production I.G perfected cyberpunk cel animation where characters and
  architecture breathe together. Clean outlines, flat colour fills, and
  multi-plane depth keep the world cohesive. MuseoMorph honors that precision
  while insisting on original iconography and modern safety.

# Production I.G Style - Cyberpunk Precision

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **16:9 environmental integration** or **2:3 character-environment** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL CEL ANIMATION DOMINANCE:** Production I.G's 2D cel animation with environmental integration overrides ALL digital painting, 3D rendering, and photorealistic approaches. **COMPLETE 2D CEL ANIMATION WITH ARCHITECTURAL PRECISION REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Production I.G 2D cel animation character** for **exact format specification** - NOT digital painting, 3D rendering, or photorealistic illustration." **Anti-Digital-Painting Priority:** **NO digital painting smoothness, 3D rendered lighting, or photorealistic surface effects.** **Completely redraw using 2D cel animation medium with flat color fills and clean line work.** Identity through **character-environment integration and spatial awareness only, NOT photographic accuracy.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `anime-precision` **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto` **Canvas Control Flag:** `format-native` **Animation Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must look like 2D cel animation character naturally embedded in architectural environment, not digital art or 3D render.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Environmental Integration] or [Architectural Scene] per image.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **16:9** (environmental integration emphasis)
- **2:3** (character-environment unity)
- **21:9** (ultra-wide architectural cityscape)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** format-native with character-environment unity emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject naturally embedded within architectural environments (no figure/background separation)
- **Background Treatment:** Multi-plane cel animation backgrounds with architectural precision and flat color layering
- **Format Justification:** Production I.G's character-environment philosophy requires seamless integration where character feels naturally part of the animated world

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Production I.G's influential approach (1987-present) pioneered **2D cel animation with architectural environmental integration** through **character-background unity** and **multi-plane animation techniques**. Production method emphasizes **traditional cel animation line work** with **flat color fills**, **architectural background research** with **photographic location reference translated to animation**, and **character-environment interaction** where figures naturally inhabit their animated spaces. Purpose focuses on **cyberpunk storytelling** through **environmental narrative** and **character spatial integration**. Hallmark motifs include **clean cel animation outlines**, **flat color backgrounds with architectural complexity**, **multi-plane scrolling depth**, **character environmental interaction**, **atmospheric perspective through color temperature only**, and **seamless figure-ground integration**. Period framing encompasses **cyberpunk animation** with **architectural authenticity** creating **2D animation environmental storytelling**.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Clean cel animation weights** at **0.8-1.2 pt** for character outlines with **consistent animation line quality**; **architectural line work** at **0.3-0.8 pt** showing **precise geometric construction** but **maintaining cel animation aesthetic**. **NO variable line weights that suggest 3D depth or digital painting**. **Color:** **Flat cel animation color fills** at **75-85% saturation** with **clear color separation boundaries**. **Cool architectural blues** (#2e4057, #1a252f) for structural elements, **warm interior lighting** (#f4a261, #e76f51) for inhabited spaces, **character skin tones** within **anime color ranges** (#fdbcb4, #f8ad9d). **NO gradient effects, digital painting blending, or 3D lighting simulation**. **Texture:** **Pure cel animation surface** with **flat color areas** and **architectural detail through line work only**. **NO digital painting textures, 3D surface effects, or photorealistic material simulation**. **Environmental complexity** achieved through **flat color layering** and **line work precision**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Character integration priority** - figures must **feel naturally part of the animated environment** with **consistent lighting** and **spatial logic**. **Large anime eyes** with **flat color iris rendering**, **architectural backgrounds** with **cel animation line precision**, **character clothing** with **flat fabric colors** and **animation-appropriate folds**. **Material simulation:** **Traditional cel animation production** with **flat color fills** and **clean registration**. **Environmental depth** through **color temperature shifts** and **multi-plane arrangement** - **NO 3D depth simulation or digital painting effects**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Character-environment unity maintained through cel animation techniques within declared aspect ratio, emphasizing architectural storytelling. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 85-95%, chaos to 5-15%, CFG scale 12-16 for **maximum cel animation authenticity** with **architectural precision**.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **Cyberpunk professional wear** with **clean cel animation color fills**, **structured blazers** in **flat color rendering**, **practical urban clothing** showing **animation fabric behavior**, ornament scale **1-2** (cel animation accessories, clean geometric jewelry); hair & makeup scale **1-2** (anime styling with **flat color application**); **professional footwear** rendered in **cel animation style**.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Corporate cyberpunk clothing** with **flat color fills** and **animation line work**, **structured professional wear** showing **cel animation fabric logic**; jewelry **0-1** pieces (geometric, animation-appropriate); **urban professional aesthetic** within **cel animation medium**.
- **Youth (girls/boys):** **School uniforms** or **casual wear** with **cel animation color fills**; **animation-appropriate styling**; **flat color rendering** throughout.
- **Fabric behavior:** **Cel animation fabric logic** with **flat color fills** and **animation-appropriate fold patterns**. **NO realistic fabric physics or digital material simulation**.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [communication device, ID badge, technical tablet, urban transport card, simple tool]
  occasional: [cyberpunk gadget, professional equipment, architectural element]
  rare: [advanced technology, environmental interface, cyberpunk artifact]
  micro: [access card, small device, personal item, urban detail]
  exclusions:
    - "no fantasy items inappropriate to cyberpunk setting"
    - "no 3D rendered or digitally painted objects"
    - "choose-one: [device, tool, accessory]"
  dependencies:
    - "all props must be rendered in cel animation style with flat colors"
    - "cyberpunk contemporary context required"
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:** "digital painting effects", "3D rendered lighting", "photorealistic materials"; **NO gradient lighting that breaks cel animation aesthetic**; **NO character-background isolation or figure separation**; **NO digital art smoothness or 3D surface rendering**; **NO realistic material physics inappropriate to animation medium**. **✅ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "authentic cel animation with environmental integration"; **Clean cel animation line work** with **flat color fills**; **Character-environment unity** through **animation techniques**; **Architectural precision** within **cel animation framework**; **Multi-plane background depth** through **color temperature and line work only**.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 16:9 Environmental:** Maximum character-environment integration with architectural cel animation storytelling
- **For 2:3 Character-Environment:** Character naturally embedded within cel animation architectural context
- **For 21:9 Ultra-wide:** Cyberpunk cityscape with character seamlessly integrated in animation style

**Staging:** Subjects **naturally embedded** within **cel animation architectural environments** showing **spatial integration** and **environmental belonging**. **Camera/perspective:** **Animation camera angles** emphasizing **character-environment relationship** within **cyberpunk urban contexts**. **Background density:** **Multi-plane cel animation backgrounds** with **architectural line precision** and **flat color complexity**. **Surface Context Anchor:** Traditional cel animation production surface appropriate to cyberpunk environmental storytelling **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Environmental cel animation extends naturally within declared ratio while maintaining character integration and animation medium authenticity.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit - **Not authentic** to Production I.G's cel animation approach; **omit all embedded text**. Production I.G emphasizes **environmental storytelling** through **character-environment integration** within **cel animation medium**.
