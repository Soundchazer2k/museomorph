# Gainax Style - Experimental Dynamism (Yoshiyuki Sadamoto Focus)


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 technical portrait** or **16:9 professional scene** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL STYLE DOMINANCE:** Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's character design mastery overrides ALL photographic likeness and conventional anime simplification. **COMPLETE TECHNICAL PRECISION TRANSFORMATION REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Yoshiyuki Sadamoto character design** for **exact format specification** - NOT photorealistic styling or generic anime." **Anti-Likeness Priority:** **NO photographic skin textures, bone structure proportions, or facial geometry.** **Completely redraw using Sadamoto's realistic anime proportions and technical precision.** Identity through **confident gesture and psychological depth only, NOT facial accuracy.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `poster-ink` **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Maximum Technical Precision:** **Subject must look like hand-drawn Sadamoto character design, not person with anime filter.** **Complete medium conversion to technical anime realism with psychological depth.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Sadamoto Character Design], [Technical Portrait], or [Psychological Study] per image.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (technical character design emphasis)
- **16:9** (professional environmental context)
- **3:4** (traditional with technical precision)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with technical precision emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for professional competence display (confident positioning, technical environment integration)
- **Background Treatment:** Lived-in technical environments with personal touches and realistic wear patterns
- **Format Justification:** Sadamoto's professional character design requires precise framing that emphasizes technical competence and psychological authenticity

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's character design mastery (1962-present) established **realistic anime proportions** through **technical precision** and **psychological depth**. Production method emphasizes **hand-drawn technical accuracy** with **detailed anatomical understanding**, **sophisticated line control**, and **realistic human imperfection integration**. Purpose focuses on **mature character development** through **confident presentation** and **psychological authenticity**. Hallmark motifs include **sharp angular facial features with subtle asymmetries, realistic 7-8 head proportions, complex iris detail work, individual hair strand definition,** and **lived-in environmental integration**. Period framing encompasses **contemporary Japanese settings** with **technical precision** and **psychological realism** creating **authentic mature anime character design**.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Technical precision weights** ranging **0.8-1.5 pt** for **sharp character definition** with **controlled, confident strokes** and **hand-drawn variation ±0.2pt** for organic authenticity; interior details **0.4-0.8 pt** emphasizing **angular facial structure** and **anatomical accuracy**. **Sharp, geometric accent lines** for **feature definition** with **subtle imperfection integration**. **Color:** **Realistic skin tone palette** at **75-85% saturation** with **subtle temperature variations** and **natural color shifts** across facial planes. Sadamoto signature approach: **complex iris coloring with multiple color rings and detailed radial patterns**, **realistic hair color variation**, **sophisticated clothing color coordination**. **Natural lighting interaction** with **realistic shadow casting**. **Eyes (ENHANCED SADAMOTO SPECIFICATIONS):** **Subtle almond shapes with realistic corners** - not rounded anime eyes. **Complex iris internal structure** with **multiple color rings** and **detailed radial patterns**. **3-4 strategic highlights** positioned at **different angles** for depth. **Realistic eye socket shadowing** with **subtle asymmetry**. **Hair Physics (CRITICAL):** **Individual strand definition** with **natural separation patterns**. **Realistic weight distribution** causing **slight asymmetrical fall**. **Hand-drawn texture irregularities** - not digital smoothness. **Natural movement suggesting** recent head movement. **Subtle messiness** and **realistic imperfection**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Technical precision composition optimized for declared aspect ratio, emphasizing professional competence within appropriate format. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 75-85%, chaos to 15-25%, CFG scale 9-12 for **technical precision** with **organic authenticity**.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **Sophisticated contemporary clothing** with **technical design precision**, **practical hemlines** for **confident professional movement**, **structured necklines** with **collar or technical details**, **fitted sleeves** showing **natural arm definition**, ornament scale **1-2** (technical accessories, sophisticated jewelry, professional items); hair & makeup scale **1-2** (defined features with **natural imperfection**, technical precision); **practical sophisticated footwear**.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Sharp tailoring** with **geometric design elements** and **realistic wear patterns**, **high-collar technical shirts** or **structured jackets**, **fitted pants** with **technical precision** and **natural fabric behavior**, **confident design choices** with **subtle asymmetrical elements**; jewelry **0-2** pieces (technical accessories, sophisticated items); **professional competence styling**.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [technical device, professional manual, communication equipment, analytical tool, personal item]
  occasional: [advanced interface, control device, research equipment, specialized gear]
  rare: [prototype technology, command insignia, advanced technical device]
  micro: [ID badge, personal token, technical accessory, cultural item]
  exclusions:
    - "no cute or childish items"
    - "no generic sci-fi without realism"
    - "choose-one: [technical device, professional tool, personal item]"
  dependencies:
    - "technical items require functional design logic"
    - "personal items must reflect character psychology"
    - "professional items match character competence and specialization"
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:** "photorealistic preservation", "generic anime simplification", "sterile perfection"; **NO passive or weak character presentation**; **NO conventional anime tropes without psychological justification**; **NO uniform lighting or perfect environments**. **✅ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "technical precision character design"; **Sharp angular facial features** with **realistic asymmetries**; **Technical precision** with **human authenticity**; **Confident character presentation** with **psychological depth**.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 2:3 Portrait:** Technical character design emphasis with professional competence focus
- **For 16:9 Scene:** Professional environmental integration with character psychological authenticity
- **For 3:4 Traditional:** Classic format with Sadamoto's technical precision treatment

**Staging:** Subjects positioned in **confident, technically precise poses** showing **professional competence** and **psychological authenticity** with **natural human warmth**. **Background density:** **Lived-in technical environments** with **personal touches** and **usage wear patterns**. **Atmospheric lighting variation** - not uniform corporate illumination. **Surface Context Anchor:** Technical animation production surface appropriate to professional character design **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Professional technical environments extend naturally within declared ratio while maintaining character psychological focus.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit - **Not authentic** to Sadamoto's character design approach for static portraits; **omit all embedded text**. Sadamoto emphasizes **pure technical character design** and **psychological visual storytelling**.
