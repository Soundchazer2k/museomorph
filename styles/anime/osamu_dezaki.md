about: >
  Osamu Dezaki pioneered the postcard memory technique, freezing animation into
  painterly stills drenched in chiaroscuro. Dutch angles, glass-rose symbolism,
  and dramatic lighting turn every frame into a psychological tableau.
  MuseoMorph honors that theatrical mood while keeping wardrobes modest and
  stories original.

# Osamu Dezaki Style - Dramatic Expressionism


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 dramatic portrait** or **16:9 cinematic postcard** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject in **Osamu Dezaki's dramatic postcard memory** style for **exact format specification**." **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via silhouette/intense emotional gesture/dramatic expression; integrate into painted-cel hybrid medium emphasizing psychological depth. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `painterly-contour` **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style dominance:** Dezaki's theatrical expressionism overrides naturalistic proportions, emphasizing emotional impact through visual drama. **Gender respect:** Honor presented gender while maintaining Dezaki's mature, psychologically complex character designs. **IP guardrail:** Archetypes only; no direct references to Ashita no Joe, Space Cobra, or other Dezaki properties. **Mode Selector:** Choose [Dramatic Portrait] or [Postcard Memory] per image.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (dramatic portrait emphasis)
- **16:9** (cinematic postcard memory)
- **3:4** (traditional dramatic composition)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with dramatic atmospheric expansion
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned using dramatic lighting angles (off-center, chiaroscuro emphasis)
- **Background Treatment:** Extend architectural shadows and atmospheric effects to fill dramatic canvas space
- **Format Justification:** Dezaki's postcard memory technique adapts to any ratio through atmospheric extension and dramatic lighting

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Osamu Dezaki's revolutionary approach (1963-2011) pioneered **"postcard memories" (tome-e)** technique, creating **pastel freeze-frames** lasting several seconds, transitioning from traditional cel animation to **detailed painted still images**. Production method emphasizes **dramatic camera work** with **Dutch angle compositions**, **multilayer scrolling backgrounds**, and **8fps limited animation** compensated by artistic still compositions. Purpose focuses on **psychological character exploration** through **visual metaphor** and **emotional symbolism**. Hallmark motifs include **dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, glass rose symbolism, split-screen internal monologues, architectural shadows,** and **atmospheric perspective shifts**. Period framing encompasses **adult-oriented drama** with **film noir influences** creating sophisticated visual storytelling.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** Variable dramatic weights ranging **0.5-2.0 pt** based on lighting conditions and emotional intensity; interior details **0.3-0.8 pt** following form-defining shadows. **Angular, geometric accent lines** for dramatic emphasis. Selective **cross-hatching 18-28 lines/inch** for shadow work and psychological texture. **Color:** **Controlled palette** transitioning between **muted dramatic tones (40-60% saturation)** and **intense emotional peaks (80-95% saturation)**. Dezaki signature techniques: **warm/cool temperature contrasts**, **spotlight isolation effects**, **gradient washes** for atmospheric depth. **Postcard memory mode:** **desaturated pastels (30-50% saturation)** with **gouache-like opacity**. **Texture:** **Painterly surface treatment** with **visible brush stroke simulation**. **Atmospheric stippling 1-3 px** for mood establishment. **Glass and reflection effects** with **specular highlights** and **environmental reflections**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Bone structure and facial planes** receive maximum attention, **hands as emotional expression tools**, clothing simplified to **dramatic silhouette elements**, backgrounds **impressionistic but architecturally sound**. **Material simulation:** **Traditional-digital hybrid** with **painted overlay effects**. **Selective focus depth** with **±2-4 px blur gradients**. **Film grain texture 0.5-1%** for cinematic quality. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Dramatic composition extends atmospheric elements seamlessly within declared aspect ratio, emphasizing emotional storytelling. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 70-85%, chaos to 20-35%, CFG scale 8-11 for dramatic contrast balance.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** Sophisticated silhouettes with **dramatic collar/neckline elements**, hemlines varying for **visual flow and wind effects**, fitted sleeves showing **arm gesture definition**, ornament scale **1-3** (statement jewelry, scarves, artistic accessories); hair & makeup scale **1-2** (defined but not theatrical); **elegant heels or sophisticated flats**.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Structured tailoring** with **strong shoulder lines**, **high-contrast collar treatments**, **fitted but not restrictive cuts**, **dramatic coat/jacket elements**; jewelry **1-2** pieces (significant accessories, watches); **formal or artistic styling preferred**.
- **Youth (girls/boys):** **Age-appropriate formal wear** with **clean lines**; **no adult sophistication mimicry**; **practical footwear**; **minimal makeup**; **props supporting character development themes**.
- **Fabric behavior:** **Natural drape** with **attention to wind and movement effects**. **Realistic fabric physics** supporting **dramatic gesture emphasis**. **Texture variety** from smooth to roughly woven.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [glass rose, cigarette case, pocket watch, leather-bound book, wine glass]
  occasional: [vintage camera, classical instrument, art brush, chess piece]
  rare: [symbolic artifact, family heirloom, artistic masterpiece]
  micro: [match, coin, letter, small photograph]
  exclusions:
    - "no cute or childish items"
    - "no modern casual technology"
  dependencies:
    - "symbolic items require thematic relevance to character psychology"
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:** "original aspect ratio", "conventional anime proportions", "bright cheerful colors"; **NO cute or moe aesthetic elements**; **NO casual contemporary clothing**; **NO simplified rendering during emotional peaks**. **✅ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "dramatic atmospheric extension"; **Strong directional lighting** with **dramatic shadow play**; **Architectural backgrounds** supporting psychological mood; **Mature character proportions**; **Sophisticated color temperature control**.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 2:3 Portrait:** Dramatic vertical emphasis with chiaroscuro lighting, subject positioned for maximum emotional impact
- **For 16:9 Cinematic:** Postcard memory treatment with atmospheric depth and architectural context
- **For 3:4 Traditional:** Classic dramatic composition with psychological architectural support

**Staging:** Subjects positioned within **dramatic lighting scenarios** emphasizing **psychological state through environmental interaction**. **Camera/perspective:** **Dutch angles 15-45 degrees** for psychological tension; **low angles for character empowerment**; **high angles for vulnerability or contemplation**. **Background density:** **Architecturally detailed** but **atmospherically simplified** to support character psychology. **Surface Context Anchor:** Painted cel animation surface appropriate to dramatic artistic expression **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Dramatic atmospheric elements extend naturally to fill declared ratio while maintaining psychological focus.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit - **Not authentic** to Dezaki's cinematic approach for static portraits; **omit all embedded text**. Dezaki's technique relies on **pure visual storytelling** and **atmospheric composition**.
