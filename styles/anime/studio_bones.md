about: >
  Studio Bones draws characters with living body language, expressive eyes, and
  environments that breathe alongside them. Yutaka Nakamura's crystalline debris
  and dynamic camera shifts keep scenes energetic even in stills. MuseoMorph
  leans into that personality-first ethos while keeping wardrobe practical and
  iconography original.

# Studio Bones Style - Character-Driven Animation Excellence


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 character study** or **16:9 dynamic scene** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject in **Studio Bones' character-driven animation excellence** style for **exact format specification**." **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **distinctive character proportions/personality-driven gesture/emotionally authentic expression**; integrate into **high-quality animation** medium emphasizing **organic character life** and **dimensional personality**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `painterly-contour` **Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style dominance:** Bones' character-focused approach prioritizes **individual personality expression** and **organic animation feel** over **generic anime conventions**. **Gender respect:** Honor presented gender while maintaining Bones' **personality-driven design** and **dimensional character philosophy**. **IP guardrail:** Archetypes only; no direct references to Fullmetal Alchemist, My Hero Academia, Soul Eater, or other Bones properties. **Mode Selector:** Choose [Character Study] or [Dynamic Scene] per image.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (character personality focus)
- **16:9** (character-environment interaction)
- **3:4** (traditional with personality emphasis)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with organic character life emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned to express individual character personality through body language and environmental interaction
- **Background Treatment:** Atmospheric environments that live and breathe with character presence, supporting individual expression
- **Format Justification:** Bones' character-driven philosophy adapts to any ratio while maintaining individual personality authenticity and organic life representation

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Studio Bones' distinctive approach (1998-present) emphasizes **character personality through design** with **organic animation principles** creating **dimensional characters** that feel **alive and individual**. Production method centers on **Yutaka Nakamura's dynamic impact sequences** featuring **crystalline geometric debris**, **personality-driven character proportions** varying by **individual character needs**, **fluid organic movement** even in **static compositions**, and **environmental atmospherics** that **breathe with character emotion**. Purpose focuses on **individual character authenticity** through **proportional personality expression** and **organic life representation**. Hallmark motifs include **Yutapon cube debris during action**, **organic character silhouettes**, **personality-driven proportional choices**, **atmospheric environmental integration**, **emotional micro-gesture emphasis**, and **living animation quality** in **static frames**. Period framing encompasses **character-driven narratives** where **individual personality** shapes **visual presentation** rather than **genre conventions**.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Organic variable weights** reflecting **character personality**: **soft, flowing lines (1.0-1.5 pt)** for **gentle characters** versus **sharp, defined lines (1.5-2.5 pt)** for **strong personalities**. **Yutapon impact sequences** exploding into **geometric crystal debris** with **sharp angular fragments (3.0-5.0 pt)**. **Character-specific line quality** matching **individual personality traits**. **Color:** **Character-driven palettes** with **organic harmony**: **warm, lived-in tones (60-75% saturation)** creating **authentic atmosphere**. **Character colors** reflecting **personality depth** rather than **generic anime schemes**. **Environmental colors** that **breathe with character emotion** and **support individual presence**. **Texture:** **Organic animation texture** showing **life and dimensionality**. **Yutapon crystalline debris** creating **sharp geometric contrast** against **organic character forms**. **Atmospheric environmental texture** that **lives and breathes** rather than **static background rendering**. **Character clothing** showing **authentic wear patterns** and **personality-driven styling choices**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Large expressive anime eyes** with **individual character personality**. **Organic proportional systems** adapted to **character personality**: **elongated proportions** for **elegant characters**, **compact proportions** for **energetic characters**, **distinctive silhouettes** that **read clearly** from **distance**. **Personality-driven facial structure** over **generic anime templates**. **Material simulation:** **Living animation quality** where **characters feel organic** and **dimensional**. **Environmental elements** that **interact naturally** with **character presence**. **Clothing and hair** that **moves naturally** even in **static representations**. **Geometric debris effects** providing **dynamic contrast** to **organic character forms**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Character personality expression maintains organic authenticity within declared aspect ratio with living environmental integration. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 75-90%, chaos to 15-30%, CFG scale 10-14 for **organic character life** with **dynamic action potential**.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **Personality-driven clothing choices** reflecting **individual character traits**, **organic fabric behavior** showing **natural wear patterns**, **practical styling** supporting **character activities** and **personal expression**, **distinctive color choices** matching **character personality**, ornament scale **1-3** (character-meaningful accessories, personal items); hair & makeup scale **1-2** (personality-authentic styling); **footwear reflecting character lifestyle**.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Character-specific clothing** showing **individual taste** and **personality expression**, **authentic fabric interaction** with **character movement**, **personal styling choices** over **generic anime conventions**; accessories **1-2** pieces (personality-meaningful items); **individual character aesthetic** over **template designs**.
- **Youth (girls/boys):** **Age-appropriate** but **personality-driven** clothing; **individual character expression** within **appropriate boundaries**; **practical choices** reflecting **character activities**; **personal styling** over **generic youth templates**.
- **Fabric behavior:** **Natural material interaction** with **character movement** and **environmental conditions**. **Realistic wear patterns** showing **character lifestyle** and **personality traits**. **Organic fabric flow** that **feels alive** rather than **static**.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [character tool, personal weapon, meaningful object, activity gear, identity marker]
  occasional: [specialized equipment, unique item, character artifact, story object]
  rare: [signature weapon, legendary tool, character-defining object]
  micro: [personal token, character charm, meaningful detail, identity piece]
  exclusions:
    - "props must reflect individual character personality"
    - "no generic items without character connection"
    - "choose-one based on character identity"
  dependencies:
    - "all props require character personality connection"
    - "individual character authenticity mandatory"
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:** "source image proportions", "generic anime templates", "static lifeless composition"; **NO character designs that could apply to anyone**; **NO environmental elements that feel lifeless or decorative**. **✅ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "organic character personality expression"; **Individual character personality** expressed through **proportions and design**; **Organic animation quality** even in **static images**; **Yutapon geometric debris** during **dynamic moments**; **Living environmental atmospherics**.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 2:3 Character:** Individual personality study with organic environmental support
- **For 16:9 Dynamic:** Character-environment interaction with personality-driven spatial relationships
- **For 3:4 Traditional:** Classic format with Bones' organic character life emphasis

**Staging:** Subjects positioned to **express individual character personality** through **body language** and **environmental interaction**. **Character-environment relationship** showing **authentic connection** rather than **decorative placement**. **Camera/perspective:** **Character-serving angles** that **enhance personality expression** and **individual authenticity**. **Background density:** **Atmospheric environments** that **live and breathe** with **character presence**, **supporting individual personality** rather than **overwhelming** or **generic decoration**. **Surface Context Anchor:** High-quality animation production surface appropriate to character-driven storytelling **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Character personality environments extend organically within declared ratio while maintaining individual authenticity and living atmospheric quality.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit - **Not authentic** to Bones' character-focused animation approaches; **omit all embedded text**. Bones emphasizes **individual character expression** through **organic visual storytelling** and **personality-driven design**.
