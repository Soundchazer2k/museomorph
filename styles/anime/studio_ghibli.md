about: >
  Studio Ghibli blends pencil linework, watercolor atmospheres, and quiet
  storytelling to make nature and characters feel lived in. Pastoral palettes,
  hand-painted cels, and gentle motion celebrate craft over spectacle.
  MuseoMorph treats the studio's look as a study in warmth and humility while
  honoring modern safety policies.

# Studio Ghibli Style - Naturalistic Poetry


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 portrait** or **16:9 landscape** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject in **Studio Ghibli's naturalistic animation** style for **[exact format specification]**." **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression; integrate fully into hand-drawn cel animation medium; avoid photorealistic faces. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `painterly-contour` **Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style dominance:** Ghibli's organic, flowing aesthetic rules override generic anime conventions. **Mode Selector:** Choose [Portrait] or [Environmental Scene] per image.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (character portrait focus)
- **16:9** (environmental storytelling)
- **3:4** (traditional illustration)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with atmospheric background expansion
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned within natural environmental context (rule-of-thirds)
- **Background Treatment:** Extend watercolor-influenced atmospheric elements (sky, foliage, distant landscapes) to fill new canvas space
- **Format Justification:** Ghibli's environmental storytelling tradition supports both intimate portraits and panoramic scenes

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Studio Ghibli's signature approach (1985-present) combines **watercolor-influenced backgrounds** with **soft cel animation**, drawing from European fairy tale illustration and Japanese nature worship. Production method emphasizes **85-90% hand-drawn content** with minimal digital smoothing, maintaining organic imperfections that create warmth. Purpose spans environmental storytelling through intimate character portraits within **naturalistic fantasy settings**. Hallmark motifs include **flowing fabric physics, atmospheric perspective, detailed food rendering, architectural integration with nature,** and **Ma philosophy negative space**. Period framing encompasses **timeless pastoral aesthetics** with subtle technological anachronisms creating dreamlike temporal ambiguity.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** Outer contours **0.8-1.2 pt** with gentle, organic curves; interior details **0.3-0.6 pt** following natural form flow. No harsh geometric angles except for architectural elements. Line density **8-15 lines/inch** for texture work, primarily in hair and fabric. **Color:** Earth-tone dominated palette at **70-85% saturation** comprising 60-70% total composition. Ghibli signature colors: sky blues (#176a90, #a3c5e0), forest greens (#74cc66), sunset oranges (#e2dd3f), warm browns (#8b4513). Avoid pure blacks or whites; use warm grays and cream tones. **Texture:** Watercolor-mimicking gradients with soft edge bleeding **2-4 px**. Atmospheric stippling **1-2 px** for distant elements. Natural fabric drape with gravity-influenced flow patterns. **Detail hierarchy:** Faces and hands receive highest detail attention, environmental elements simplified to impressionistic suggestions, food and mechanical objects rendered with loving precision. **Material simulation:** Traditional cel production artifacts with **±0.5 px registration** variance. Paint bucket fills with slight texture grain **85-95 LPI equivalent**. Subtle color vibration **±3-5% hue shift** mimicking hand-painted cels. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition flows naturally within declared aspect ratio; background elements extend seamlessly to canvas edges.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** Flowing A-line silhouettes, hemlines mid-calf to ankle length, modest necklines (crew, boat, high collar), three-quarter to full sleeves, ornament scale **0-2** (simple jewelry, hair accessories); hair & makeup scale **0-1** (natural only); comfortable flats or low boots.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** Relaxed tailoring with natural drape, button-up shirts or vests, straight-leg trousers, minimal lapels if jackets present, simple caps or bare head; jewelry **0-1** pieces (watch, simple ring); **no formal business attire**.
- **Youth (girls/boys):** Simple dresses, overalls, or comfortable separates; **no form-fitting or revealing cuts**; sturdy shoes or bare feet; **no makeup**; **age-appropriate props only**.
- **Fabric behavior:** Natural drape emphasizing cotton, linen, wool textures; matte surfaces with minimal synthetic sheen. Gentle wrinkle patterns following body movement.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [wicker basket, watering can, simple book, clay pot, wooden spoon]
  occasional: [telescope, music box, hand mirror, seed packet]
  rare: [magical amulet, floating crystal, spirit mask]
  micro: [flower sprig, butterfly, acorn, small stone]
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:** "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "photorealistic preservation"; **NO photorealistic skin textures/pores**; **NO sharp digital artifacts**; **NO neon or synthetic colors**; **NO oversaturated vivid colors**. **✅ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "recomposed for naturalistic storytelling"; **Complete transformation into hand-painted Ghibli aesthetic**; **Natural atmospheric lighting**; **Organic line variation with hand-drawn imperfection**.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 2:3 Portrait:** Vertical emphasis with subject positioned lower-third, atmospheric background filling upper portion
- **For 16:9 Landscape:** Environmental panorama with character integrated naturally, Ma philosophy negative space
- **For 3:4:** Classical illustration balance with environmental context

**Staging:** Subjects positioned within **environmental context** showing relationship to natural world. **Background density:** Detailed but not competing with subject; **atmospheric perspective** with distant elements becoming softer and cooler. **Surface Context Anchor:** Traditional illustration paper or canvas surface appropriate to hand-drawn animation **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for declared ratio, extending Ghibli's environmental philosophy

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit - **Not authentic** to Ghibli animation style for static portraits; **omit all embedded text**. Ghibli films rely on pure visual storytelling.
