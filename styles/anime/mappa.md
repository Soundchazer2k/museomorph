# MAPPA Style - Modern Cinematic Animation

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **16:9 modern cinematic** or **2:3 contemporary portrait** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL MODERN ANIMATION DOMINANCE:** MAPPA's modern cinematic animation overrides ALL digital illustration, over-rendered art, and realistic painting approaches. **COMPLETE MODERN CEL ANIMATION WITH SHARP DIGITAL PRECISION REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **MAPPA modern cinematic animation** for **exact format specification** - NOT digital illustration, realistic rendering, or over-polished art." **Anti-Digital-Illustration Priority:** **NO digital painting smoothness, over-rendered surfaces, or realistic illustration techniques that break animation aesthetic.** **Completely redraw using modern cel animation medium with sharp digital coloring and clean line work.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `anime-precision` **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Animation Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must look like modern cel animation character with sharp digital precision, not digital art or illustration.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Modern Portrait] or [Cinematic Scene] per image.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **16:9** (modern cinematic standard)
- **2:3** (contemporary character focus)
- **3:4** (modern portrait emphasis)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with modern cinematic language
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned using contemporary film techniques (character prominence with cinematic support)
- **Background Treatment:** Clean, modern backgrounds that support character without competing for attention
- **Format Justification:** MAPPA's modern approach requires cinematic framing that emphasizes contemporary character excellence with sophisticated but supportive environments

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

MAPPA's innovative approach (2011-present) represents **modern anime evolution** through **contemporary cinematic animation** and **sharp digital production excellence**. Production method emphasizes **clean modern cel animation** with **sharp digital coloring**, **contemporary character proportions**, **modern lighting design**, and **cinematic visual language**. Purpose focuses on **modern storytelling** through **contemporary animation techniques** and **cinematic character presentation**. Hallmark motifs include **sharp, clean line work**, **modern digital color precision**, **contemporary character proportions**, **cinematic framing techniques**, **sophisticated modern lighting**, and **clean animation aesthetics**. Period framing encompasses **contemporary settings** with **modern animation production values** creating **next-generation anime aesthetics**.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Sharp modern animation weights** at **0.8-1.5 pt** with **clean digital precision** and **contemporary line quality**. **No over-rendering or illustration techniques** - maintain **sharp cel animation aesthetic**. **Character facial features** with **modern anime precision** and **clean geometric definition**. **Color:** **Modern digital palettes** at **80-90% saturation** with **sharp color separation** and **contemporary digital color grading**. **Clean color fills** with **modern anime color harmony**. **Sharp color boundaries** without **digital painting blending** or **over-rendered gradients**. **Texture:** **Clean modern cel animation surface** with **sharp digital precision** and **contemporary animation texture work**. **NO digital illustration textures or over-rendered surface effects**. **Modern fabric rendering** with **clean animation fold patterns**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Contemporary anime facial proportions** with **sharp feature definition** and **modern character design precision**. **Clean background rendering** that **supports without competing**. **Modern animation detail distribution** prioritizing **character excellence**. **Material simulation:** **Modern digital cel animation production** with **sharp color registration** and **clean animation techniques**. **Contemporary lighting models** within **animation framework** - **NO realistic material simulation that breaks animation aesthetic**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Modern animation composition optimized for declared aspect ratio with contemporary cinematic character focus. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 80-90%, chaos to 5-15%, CFG scale 11-15 for **modern animation precision** with **sharp digital clarity**.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **Contemporary fashion** with **modern styling trends** and **clean animation rendering**, **current silhouettes** with **sharp digital color application**, ornament scale **1-2** (modern accessories, contemporary items); hair & makeup scale **1-2** (contemporary styling with **clean animation application**); **modern footwear** rendered in **sharp animation style**.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Contemporary masculine fashion** with **modern tailoring** and **clean animation rendering**, **current styling** appropriate to **modern character design**; accessories **0-2** pieces (contemporary, animation-appropriate); **modern urban aesthetic** within **clean animation medium**.
- **Youth (girls/boys):** **Contemporary youth fashion** with **modern styling** and **clean animation color application**; **modern footwear** rendered in **animation style**.
- **Fabric behavior:** **Modern animation fabric logic** with **clean fold patterns** and **contemporary material rendering** within **animation framework**.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [smartphone, modern headphones, contemporary bag, current technology, modern lifestyle item]
  occasional: [modern professional equipment, current hobby gear, contemporary tool, modern device]
  rare: [cutting-edge technology, modern specialized equipment, contemporary professional tool]
  micro: [modern accessory, current small tech, contemporary personal item, modern detail]
  exclusions:
    - "no over-rendered objects that break animation aesthetic"
    - "no realistic illustration elements inappropriate to animation medium"
  dependencies:
    - "all props must be rendered in clean modern animation style"
    - "contemporary technological accuracy required within animation framework"
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:** "digital illustration smoothness", "over-rendered surfaces", "realistic painting techniques"; **NO digital art over-polish that breaks animation aesthetic**; **NO environmental detail overwhelming character presence**; **NO illustration techniques inappropriate to modern animation**. **✅ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "modern cinematic animation"; **Sharp digital animation precision** with **clean color separation**; **Contemporary character excellence** with **modern animation proportions**; **Cinematic composition techniques** within **animation framework**; **Clean modern backgrounds** that **support character prominence**.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 16:9 Cinematic:** Modern cinematic framing with contemporary character prominence and clean background support
- **For 2:3 Contemporary:** Character focus with modern animation precision and clean environmental context
- **For 3:4 Modern:** Portrait emphasis with MAPPA's contemporary animation excellence

**Staging:** Subjects positioned using **modern cinematic techniques** showing **contemporary character presentation** within **clean, sophisticated environments**. **Background density:** **Clean modern environments** that **enhance character presence** without **competing for attention** or **overwhelming character excellence**. **Surface Context Anchor:** Modern digital animation production surface appropriate to contemporary storytelling **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Modern animation excellence maintains character focus within declared ratio while clean environments provide sophisticated support without competition.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit - **Not authentic** to MAPPA's cinematic animation approach; **omit all embedded text**. MAPPA emphasizes **modern visual storytelling** through **contemporary animation techniques** and **cinematic character presentation**.
