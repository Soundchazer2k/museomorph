# Madhouse Style - Precision Animation Excellence

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 character study** or **3:4 portrait focus** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL CHARACTER DOMINANCE:** Madhouse's character-focused excellence overrides ALL environmental storytelling and background dominance approaches. **COMPLETE CHARACTER PRECISION WITH ATMOSPHERIC SUPPORT REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Madhouse character-focused animation** for **exact format specification** - NOT environmental integration or Production I.G-style background dominance." **Anti-Environmental-Dominance Priority:** **NO environmental storytelling that competes with character focus, architectural precision that overwhelms character presence, or background complexity that reduces character impact.** **Completely prioritize character excellence with supportive but simplified backgrounds.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `painterly-contour` **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Animation Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must dominate composition as sophisticated anime character with film-quality detail, not environmental integration piece.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Character Excellence] or [Psychological Portrait] per image.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (character psychological study)
- **3:4** (portrait excellence focus)
- **16:9** (cinematic character scene - character still dominates)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with character dominance emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for maximum character impact (central prominence, psychological focus)
- **Background Treatment:** Simplified atmospheric environments that support but never compete with character excellence
- **Format Justification:** Madhouse's character-centric philosophy requires framing that emphasizes individual character sophistication and psychological depth over environmental storytelling

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Madhouse's legendary approach (1972-present) established **character-focused animation excellence** through **individual character sophistication** and **psychological depth presentation**. Production method emphasizes **character detail priority** with **film-quality facial animation**, **sophisticated character proportions**, **mature character design**, and **atmospheric backgrounds that support without competing**. Purpose centers on **character psychological exploration** through **individual excellence** and **sophisticated character presentation**. Hallmark motifs include **mature character proportions with realistic anime anatomy**, **sophisticated facial detail and expression work**, **psychological depth in character design**, **film-quality character animation potential**, **atmospheric environmental support**, and **character-centric composition dominance**. Period framing encompasses **character-driven narratives** with **sophisticated visual presentation** creating **animation as character art medium**.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Character-focused precision weights** ranging **0.6-1.5 pt** for **character definition with sophisticated detail control**. **Environmental line work** at **0.3-0.8 pt** maintaining **supportive but simplified approach**. **Character facial features** receive **maximum line precision** with **psychological expression emphasis**. **Color:** **Character-centric palettes** at **70-85% saturation** with **sophisticated character color harmony** and **environmental color support**. **Character skin tones** with **realistic anime color ranges** and **sophisticated shading**. **Background colors** remain **atmospherically supportive** without **competing for attention**. **Texture:** **Character surface excellence** with **sophisticated anime texture work** and **film-quality character detail**. **Environmental texture** kept **atmospheric and supportive** rather than **architecturally precise**. **Character clothing** with **realistic fabric behavior** and **sophisticated material rendering**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Character faces receive maximum attention** with **sophisticated anime facial proportions**, **psychological expression complexity**, **mature character anatomy**, and **film-quality character detail**. **Backgrounds simplified** to **atmospheric support** maintaining **character visual dominance**. **Material simulation:** **Character-focused rendering** with **sophisticated anime character techniques** and **film-quality character surface work**. **Environmental elements** kept **atmospherically supportive** without **competing material complexity**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Character excellence maintains dominance within declared aspect ratio with atmospheric environmental support that never competes. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 70-80%, chaos to 10-20%, CFG scale 9-12 for **character excellence** with **atmospheric support**.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **Sophisticated contemporary styling** with **mature fashion sensibility**, **realistic contemporary silhouettes** supporting **character personality expression**, ornament scale **1-2** (sophisticated accessories supporting character depth); hair & makeup scale **1-2** (mature styling with **character personality reflection**); **sophisticated footwear** appropriate to **character psychology**.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Mature contemporary fashion** with **sophisticated tailoring** and **character personality expression**, **authentic contemporary styling** appropriate to **individual character depth**; accessories **0-2** pieces (psychologically meaningful, character-supporting); **sophisticated character aesthetic**.
- **Youth (girls/boys):** **Age-appropriate contemporary wear** with **character personality expression** and **sophisticated but appropriate styling**; **character-appropriate footwear**; **styling supporting individual character development**.
- **Fabric behavior:** **Sophisticated fabric physics** with **realistic contemporary material behavior** and **character personality support through clothing choices**.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [character-meaningful object, personal item, lifestyle tool, psychological artifact, identity marker]
  occasional: [specialized equipment, character hobby item, personal technology, meaningful accessory]
  rare: [character-defining object, narrative significance item, personal treasure]
  micro: [personal detail, character charm, psychological anchor, individual marker]
  exclusions:
    - "no environmental objects that compete with character focus"
    - "no complex mechanical items that distract from character excellence"
  dependencies:
    - "all props must support character psychology and individual depth"
    - "character authenticity and psychological relevance mandatory"
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:** "environmental storytelling dominance", "architectural precision competing with character", "background complexity overwhelming character presence"; **NO Production I.G-style environmental integration**; **NO environmental detail that reduces character impact**; **NO background elements competing for visual attention**. **✅ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "character excellence dominance"; **Sophisticated character detail** with **psychological depth**; **Film-quality character animation potential**; **Mature character proportions** with **realistic anime anatomy**; **Atmospheric environmental support** that **enhances rather than competes**.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 2:3 Character:** Character psychological study with maximum character focus and atmospheric support
- **For 3:4 Portrait:** Character excellence emphasis with sophisticated environmental context that supports
- **For 16:9 Cinematic:** Character-dominated scene with environmental context supporting character presence

**Staging:** Subjects positioned for **character excellence display** with **psychological depth emphasis** and **sophisticated character presentation**. **Background density:** **Atmospheric environmental support** that **enhances character presence** without **competing for attention** or **overwhelming character excellence**. **Surface Context Anchor:** Character-focused animation production surface appropriate to individual excellence **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Character excellence maintains dominance within declared ratio while atmospheric environments provide supportive context without competition.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit - **Not authentic** to Madhouse's character-focused animation approach; **omit all embedded text**. Madhouse emphasizes **character excellence** through **sophisticated individual presentation** and **psychological character depth**.
