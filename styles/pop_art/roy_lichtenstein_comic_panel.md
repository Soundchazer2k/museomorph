# Roy Lichtenstein (Pop Art Period, 1961-1966)

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.

**Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.

**Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette, gesture, and expression through comic book stereotypes.

**Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language.

**Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials simulate commercial printing supersedes visual appearance.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `halftone-dot-mechanical`

**Pose Flags:** `candid-motion`, `frontal-rigid`, `theatrical-archetype`

**Canvas Control Flags:** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`

**Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.

**Text policy:** Optional - follows Section 8 authorization.

**Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; no copyrighted comic book characters or recognizable superhero iconography.

**Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral attire.

**Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters; surface must exhibit authentic mechanical printing simulation with Ben Day dots.

**Period Production Authenticity:** Simulate cheap 1960s comic book printing - newsprint texture, mechanical halftone dots, flat offset color.

**Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, or credits.

**Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid painterly brushwork, color gradients, atmospheric shading, perspective depth, sensitive line variation.

**Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Redraw in **Roy Lichtenstein's American Pop Art style (1961-1966 classic period)** for **single-panel comic book enlargement**.

Identity via silhouette, gesture, emotional archetype, and comic book stereotyped features.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original character design avoiding copyrighted comic book characters, superhero iconography, recognizable logos, or trademarked costume elements. No existing comic book character names, symbols, or distinctive design elements.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `halftone-dot-mechanical` - skin rendered with uniform red/pink Ben Day dots over white ground creating optical flesh tone.

**Pose Flag:** Selected from `theatrical-archetype` (romance comic emotional poses), `candid-motion` (action sequences), or `frontal-rigid` (confrontational direct address).

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` for dramatic cropping emphasis.

**Style Dominance:** Commercial printing aesthetic dominates over photographic likeness; comic book archetype convention supersedes naturalism.

**Mode Selector:** Single-panel enlargement - extracted comic frame presented as monumental painting.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

### Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

**PRIMARY FORMATS:**

- `1:1` (square - iconic single subject)
- `4:5` (portrait - close emotional drama)
- `3:4` (classical portrait - figure dominance)
- `5:4` (near-square landscape - two-figure interaction)
- `4:3` (landscape - action/narrative scene)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

**Reframing Method:** Aggressive cropping with figure-to-edge contact - forms press against canvas boundaries to flatten pictorial space and assert two-dimensionality.

**Spatial Allocation:**

- Single figure: occupies 75-85% of canvas area
- Two figures: combined 80-90% of canvas area
- Background: reduced to minimal flat color fields or uniform dot patterns

**Background Treatment:** Radically simplified - solid primary color field, uniform Ben Day dot pattern, or minimal geometric elements. No environmental detail, no atmospheric perspective, no depth cues.

**Format Justification:** Mimics single comic book panel extracted and monumentalized. Ratio chosen enhances emotional impact of frozen narrative moment - portrait for intimacy, landscape for action, square for iconic isolation.

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

### Artistic Style & Context

**Core Influences:**

- 1950s-1960s romance comic books (DC Comics romance titles, Charlton romance comics)
- War comic books (DC war titles, action comics)
- Commercial advertising graphics
- Yellow Pages telephone directory layouts
- Bubble gum wrapper graphics
- Direct reaction against Abstract Expressionism's gestural emotionalism

**Medium/Production Method:** Oil and Magna acrylic on canvas, executed to precisely simulate mechanical offset printing on cheap newsprint. Ben Day dot patterns hand-created using custom stencils, dog-grooming brush, or wire screen frottage to achieve perfectly uniform mechanical appearance. Goal is to eliminate all evidence of artist's hand and replicate industrial reproduction process.

**Thematic Purpose:** Elevation of "low" commercial mass-media imagery to "high" art status through ironic parody of representational linear drawing. Transformation of disposable comic book clichés into monumental cultural icons. "Cool," detached, depersonalized aesthetic replacing subjective emotional expression.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Ben Day Dot System:** Mechanically uniform circular dots in single primary colors creating optical tone mixing. Red/pink dots over white = flesh tones. Blue dots = background atmosphere. Yellow dots = highlights. Dot density controls perceived saturation - no gradation within single dot field.
2. **Heavy Black Enclosure Lines:** Thick, unmodulated black contour lines with characteristic blunt terminals ending in ink "blobs." Lines enclose all forms creating discrete cells. No sensitive line variation, no calligraphic quality - deliberately awkward and depersonalized.
3. **Emotional Archetypes:** Theatrical poses derived from romance comic clichés - crying girls with hand to face, passionate embraces, vulnerable gazes, clenched fists of aggression. Figures frozen in peak emotional moments extracted from narrative context.
4. **Simplified Stylized Anatomy:** Comic book stereotype features - large oval eyes, minimal nose indication, full lips with white highlight, hair rendered as parallel curved line clusters. Anti-naturalistic proportions serve emotional archetype over anatomical accuracy.
5. **Typography Integration (Optional):** Speech bubbles, thought bubbles, sound effect onomatopoeia, caption boxes - fully integrated as graphic compositional elements when present. Hand-lettered uppercase sans-serif mimicking commercial comic lettering.

**Period Framing:** 1961-1966 classic Pop Art period - height of Lichtenstein's comic book appropriation phase. Authentic production era when cheap commercial printing aesthetic was central conceptual strategy.

**Tone Tag:** Cool, detached, ironic, confrontational, anti-sentimental. Mechanical reproduction aesthetic creating emotional distance from subject matter.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Simulate 1960s four-color offset printing process on newsprint - hard-edged flat color registration, visible halftone dot structure, no color bleed, industrial finish eliminating painterly surface.

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

### Technical Execution

**Core Technical Anchors:**

1. **Ben Day Dot Rendering (Primary Surface Treatment):**
   - Dot diameter: 2-3mm equivalent at viewing scale
   - Dot spacing: uniform 4-5mm center-to-center
   - Dot color: single pure primary per area - red/pink for skin, blue for backgrounds/shadows, yellow for highlights/hair
   - Dot density: consistent 50% or 75% coverage per zone - no gradation
   - Dot perfection: mechanically circular, precise spacing, zero hand-drawn irregularity
   - White ground visible: dots always over white, never over other colors
   - Application zones: skin tones universally red/pink dots, backgrounds often blue or yellow dots, hair can be solid or dotted
2. **Line Quality (Enclosure Drawing System):**
   - Line weight: heavy uniform black, 3-5mm equivalent thickness
   - Line character: blunt, unmodulated, deliberately awkward
   - Terminal treatment: emphatic ink blob at line endings - visible 2-3mm circular blot that appears as if pen was lifted while ink pooled
   - Enclosure mandate: every form completely outlined creating discrete closed cells
   - Interior lines: minimal - hair strands (3-7 parallel curves), fabric folds (1-3 lines maximum), facial features (extreme simplification)
   - No sensitive variation: zero calligraphic quality, zero tapering, constant width
   - Edge quality: hard, crisp - simulating printed ink edge
3. **Color System (Absolute Primary Restriction):**
   - Palette: red, yellow, blue, black, white ONLY
   - No mixing: colors applied at full intensity, unmixed, straight from conceptual "can"
   - No gradation: each color zone is flat uniform application
   - No intermediate colors: no orange, green, purple, no desaturated or muted tones
   - Hard edges: all color boundaries are sharp, no feathering
   - Opaque coverage: simulate offset printing ink density
   - Saturation: maximum intensity always
4. **Facial Rendering (Stereotype Convention):**
   - Eyes: large ovals or circles, smaller circular pupils, 3-5 eyelash marks for female figures, minimal detail for male figures
   - Nose: profile = single curved line; frontal = two small marks or omitted entirely; three-quarter = L-shaped mark
   - Mouth: female = full lips with white highlight on lower lip, red fill; male = thin simplified outline; open mouth = simple white tooth shapes
   - Skin: uniform red/pink Ben Day dots over entire face area creating optical flesh tone
   - Expression: wide eyes = drama, closed eyes = distress, narrow eyes = determination; simplified emotional archetypes
5. **Hair Treatment:**
   - Structure: parallel curved line clusters, 3-7 strands per group
   - Color: large solid yellow, blue, or black areas with line overlay
   - Highlights: white negative space creating shine effect
   - Flow: directional lines following hair movement
   - Detail hierarchy: major directional masses, minimal individual strand indication
   - Female vs male: females have flowing dramatic strands, males have simpler shorter treatment
6. **Spatial Flattening (Anti-Illusionism):**
   - Zero atmospheric perspective
   - Zero linear perspective
   - Overlapping planes maintain discrete boundaries
   - No depth cues, no modeling, no chiaroscuro
   - Aggressive cropping presses forms to canvas edge
   - Background = flat color field or uniform dot pattern with no recession
7. **Pose Anchors (Emotional Archetype):**
   - Distress: hand to face, tilted head, wide eyes, tears indicated by small blue lines
   - Passion: embracing figures, tilted heads touching, closed eyes
   - Aggression: clenched fist, squared shoulders, narrow eyes
   - Vulnerability: open palm gestures, direct gaze, parted lips
   - Action: dynamic diagonal body axis, speed lines, foreshortened limbs
   - All poses simplified to essential gesture - no complex articulation
8. **Production Method Anchor (Printing Simulation):**
   - Surface: hard, flat, non-painterly - simulate offset printing on paper
   - Finish: matte, industrial, machine-made appearance
   - Registration: precise color edge alignment mimicking printing press
   - Texture: eliminate all canvas texture, brushstroke evidence, paint facture
   - Goal: painting that appears to BE a printed comic panel, not a painting OF one

**Scale Hierarchy:** Figure elements proportional unless serving emotional emphasis - eyes can be enlarged for vulnerability, hands enlarged for gesture significance. Proportional accuracy secondary to emotional archetype clarity.

**Material Authenticity:** Surface exhibits authentic mechanical printing simulation - perfect dot uniformity, industrial line quality, flat opaque color application with zero painterly characteristics.

**Period Consistency:** All technical elements match 1961-1966 classic Pop period - pre-Brushstroke series, pure comic book appropriation phase.

**Canvas Adaptation:** Composition aggressively reformatted for declared ratio - figures cropped and repositioned to maximize edge contact and flatten space within target format.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

### Fashion & Attire - Wardrobe Matrix + Prop Selector

**Wardrobe Tracks:**

**Female Attire (Adult):**

- Simple sleeveless dresses (red, blue, yellow solid colors)
- Blouses with minimal collar detail (1-3 curved lines indicating structure)
- Sweaters with simple neckline indication
- Color: primary colors only - red, blue, yellow; occasionally black or white
- Detail: 1-3 lines maximum per garment indicating seams, necklines, or structure
- Fit: simplified to body contour - no complex drapery
- Accessories: pearl earrings (white circles), minimal jewelry

**Male Attire (Adult):**

- Business suits (blue most common, also black)
- Military uniforms (blue or green with minimal insignia)
- Casual shirts with collars (red, blue, yellow)
- Ties (solid color rectangle with single diagonal line)
- Color: blue dominates male wardrobe; also red, black, white
- Detail: collar lines, lapel indication with 2-3 lines, minimal beyond structure
- No pattern complexity - solid colors only

**Fabric Behavior:**

- No realistic drape or fold complexity
- Garments conform to body as simple color zones
- Folds indicated by 1-3 black lines maximum

- Glass/cup (simple geometric vessel for domestic scenes)

**Color Palette Restrictions:**

- Primary colors ONLY: red, yellow, blue
- Neutrals: black, white
- NO intermediate colors, NO patterns except rare simplified leopard print (black spots on yellow), NO complex decorative elements

**Wardrobe Variation Required:** Cycle through color combinations: red dress with blue background, yellow dress with red background, blue dress with yellow background. Vary garment type: dress, blouse, sweater, suit. Change accessory presence: with earrings, without earrings. Avoid identical color schemes in sequential iterations.

**Props - YAML Pool:**

```yaml
hero_props:
  - telephone_handset_black_coiled_cord
  - coffee_cup_simplified_geometric
  - glass_cylindrical_simple
  - compact_mirror_circular
  - cigarette_simplified_cylinder
  - book_rectangular_minimal
  - letter_white_rectangle

micro_props:
  - pearl_earring_white_circle
  - ring_simplified_band
  - watch_geometric_face
  - pen_simple_cylinder
  - lipstick_tube_red
```

**Total Props:** 1 hero maximum OR 1-2 micro accessories; fallback = clean scene with zero props.

**Coherence Filter:** All elements support 1960s middle-class American consumer culture context as filtered through romance and action comics. If period-inappropriate or culturally incoherent, fallback = simplified attire with no props. NO modern technology, NO contemporary fashion elements, NO anachronistic objects.

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

### Constraints

**Canvas Negatives (Anti-Patterns - Minimum 2 Required):**

Ratio-Specific:

- "original aspect ratio"
- "source dimensions"
- "unmodified framing"

Frame/Border-Specific (CRITICAL):

- "black border frame"

- "desaturated tones"
- "color gradation"
- "harmonious palette"

**Canvas Positives (Required Constraints - Minimum 2 Required):**

Ratio Enforcement:

- "exactly [declared ratio]"
- "recomposed for [format name]"

Border/Edge Treatment (CRITICAL):

- "extends to physical canvas edge"
- "borderless composition"
- "no external borders"
- "image bleeds to edge"

Technique-Specific:

- "mechanical Ben Day dot pattern"
- "uniform circular halftone dots"
- "flat two-dimensional space"
- "thick black enclosing outlines"
- "blunt line terminals with ink blobs"
- "primary colors only - red, yellow, blue, black, white"
- "hard-edged color boundaries"

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

### Composition & Background

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

**For Square (1:1):**

- Central subject placement with radial emphasis
- Figure dominance 75-80% of canvas
- Symmetrical or near-symmetrical balance
- Background = simple flat color field or uniform dot pattern
- Iconic isolation emphasis

**For Portrait Ratios (3:4, 4:5):**

- Vertical emphasis with figure extending to top and bottom edges
- Subject dominance 80-85% of canvas
- Aggressive cropping at shoulders or mid-torso
- Background minimal - compressed to thin zones at edges or top
- Hierarchical staging: face > gesture > costume > background

**For Landscape Ratios (4:3, 5:4):**

- Horizontal flow for two-figure interaction or action sequence
- Combined figure dominance 80-90% of canvas
- Panoramic staging: figures side-by-side or overlapping
- Background = horizontal color bands or uniform dot field
- Action emphasis: speed lines, explosion effects, or environmental minimal geometry

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**Perspective Regime:** Strict flattened non-perspectival system. Zero linear perspective, zero atmospheric perspective. All forms exist on frontal picture plane with overlapping but never receding into space.

**Grid/Symmetry:** Centralized organization with heavy forms extending to touch framing edges. Bilateral near-symmetry common for single figures; asymmetrical but balanced for two-figure compositions.

**Figure:Ground Ratio:** 75-90% figure dominance. Background compressed to minimal zones, eliminated entirely, or reduced to flat color/dot pattern fields.

**Density:** High figure density, minimal background density. All visual interest concentrated in subject - background provides contrast, not information.

**Lighting Logic:** No naturalistic lighting. Form defined entirely by black outline and flat color fill. Highlights indicated by white shapes, shadows indicated by dot patterns - both non-directional and non-atmospheric.

**Detail:Negative Space Ratio:** Minimal detail in figures (simplified features, minimal interior lines), maximum negative space in backgrounds. Simplification serves clarity of emotional archetype and graphic impact.

**Composition Optimized for Declared Ratio:**

- Square: central iconic subject
- Portrait: vertical figure emphasis with top-to-bottom edge contact
- Landscape: horizontal action or two-figure interaction
- All ratios: aggressive cropping pressing forms to edges

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:** Canvas simulating printed comic book panel on newsprint - flat, matte, industrial surface with no painterly texture.

**Frame/Band Anchor:** CRITICAL - Absolutely NO black borders, frames, or rectangular outlines around the image. Composition must extend to the physical canvas edge with no buffer zone. Image appears as if comic panel extracted directly from page with no added framing elements. This is a fundamental characteristic of Lichtenstein's work and non-negotiable for authenticity.

**Production Context Anchor:** 1960s four-color offset printing on cheap newsprint - characteristic Ben Day dot patterns, hard-edged color registration, flat opaque inks, mechanical reproduction aesthetic.

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for declared ratio, not adapted from different format. Figure placement, cropping strategy, and background treatment all serve target aspect ratio's dramatic potential.

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Text OPTIONAL - can omit entirely or include as integrated graphic element.

**If Text Allowed:**

**Ratio-Appropriate Zones:**

- Square (1:1): text confined to upper 20% or lower 15%, never centered
- Portrait (3:4, 4:5): text in upper 25% as thought bubble or speech bubble emerging from top edge
- Landscape (4:3, 5:4): text in left or right 30% zone, or spanning upper 20% as caption box

**Copy Limits:**

- Speech/thought bubbles: maximum 15 words per bubble, ideally 8-12 words
- Caption boxes: maximum 20 words, broken into 2-3 lines
- Sound effects: single word, maximum 6 letters (e.g., WHAAM!, POW!, VICKI!)
- Dialogue punctuation: periods, exclamation points, question marks only - no ellipses or complex punctuation

**Period-Appropriate Typography:**

- Hand-lettered uppercase sans-serif mimicking 1960s comic book lettering
- Bold uniform stroke weight
- Generous letter spacing for high legibility
- Left-aligned in speech/thought bubbles
- Centered in caption boxes
- Italic for emphasis or interior monologue

**Font Recommendation:** Closest Google Font: **Anton** (bold compressed sans-serif, 70% match to comic lettering conventions) Better professional match: **Comicraft fonts** (professional comic lettering), **Blambot fonts** (authentic comic typography), or hand-lettered uppercase sans-serif with slight irregularity suggesting manual creation.

**Text Integration Elements:**

**Speech Bubbles:**

- Organic cloud-like outline with pointed tail directing to speaker
- White fill with black outline (2-3mm thick line)
- Text in bold black uppercase
- Bubble integrated as compositional element - can touch canvas edge
- Tail placement indicates speaker clearly

**Thought Bubbles:**

- Cloud-like form connected to thinker by chain of small circles (descending size)
- Same treatment as speech bubbles but with bubble-chain connector
- Indicates interior monologue

**Caption Boxes:**

- Rectangular yellow box with black outline
- Black italic text on yellow ground
- Typically upper left or upper right corner
- Contains narrative text setting scene or providing context

**Sound Effects (Onomatopoeia):**

- Large stylized letters as graphic element
- Yellow or red with black outline, or white with black outline
- Scale competes with figures for visual dominance
- Integrated into action/explosion imagery
- Examples: WHAAM!, POW!, BLAM!, VROOM!

**Format-Specific Text Rules:**

**Single Portrait Print Mode (No Masthead):**

- Text optional but if included, must be speech bubble, thought bubble, or sound effect integrated INTO image
- NO caption boxes, NO title text, NO credits
- Text serves dramatic emphasis, not publication function

**Period Accuracy:** All typography must match 1960s comic book lettering conventions - hand-lettered quality, bold sans-serif, high-contrast black on white (or black on yellow for captions).

**Historical Accuracy:** Text content, if present, should reflect 1960s dialogue patterns - period-appropriate language, emotional directness, melodramatic phrasing typical of romance or action comics.
