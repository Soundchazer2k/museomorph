  Andy Warhol treated mass culture like a printing press—appropriating publicity
  photos and supermarket packaging, then blasting them into lurid color
  separations. This scaffold recreates his 1962–1969 silkscreen process with flat
  pop palettes, deliberate registration drift, and machine-like detachment.

# Andy Warhol Pop Art Illustration

**Based on visual analysis of 1962-1969 Factory era silkscreen works**

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via appropriated media imagery flattened to graphic shapes.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("registration drift 2-3mm", "ink coverage 85-95%") override descriptive language ("slightly misaligned", "uneven").
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How silkscreen process is simulated supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** Warhol-specific flags permitted when standard options fail authenticity requirements.
- **Material Physics Authority:** Silkscreen ink properties, canvas substrate, and printing mechanics override aesthetic preferences.
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real celebrity likenesses; no actual copyrighted brand logos or trademarked characters.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral (21+).
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics silkscreen; surface must exhibit authentic mechanical reproduction characteristics.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Use 1960s Factory-era silkscreen printing methods with characteristic registration drift, uneven ink coverage, and halftone dot patterns - avoid modern digital perfection.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid painterly autopilot, HDR smoothing, perfect digital gradients.
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

**Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**

- *Print/Reproduction (Warhol-appropriate):* `silkscreen-layered`, `offset-dot`, `halftone-dot`, `four-color-process`, `registration-drift`
- *Other options (for reference):* `engrave-hatch`, `woodblock-carved`, `lithographic-psychological`

**Pose Flags (choose one):**

- *Appropriated Media (Warhol-appropriate):* `appropriated-media-pose`, `frontal-rigid`, `power-stance`
- *Other options (for reference):* `contrapposto`, `candid-motion`, `hieratic-formal`

**Canvas Control Flags (choose one):**

- *Warhol-appropriate:* `strict-reframe`, `format-native`
- *Other options (for reference):* `adaptive-extend`, `source-respect`

**Conceptual Anchor:** Art as commodity. The artist as machine. Everything is on the surface. Mass production as artistic philosophy.

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to declared aspect ratio for 1960s Pop Art presentation. Ignore source dimensions.

Redraw subject in **Andy Warhol 1960s Pop Art silkscreen style** for gallery canvas or print reproduction.

**CRITICAL APPROPRIATION MANDATE:** Subject must be sourced from popular culture, mass media, or consumer products. Do NOT create original poses or compositions. Appropriate the visual language of advertising, publicity photography, or commercial packaging.

**IP Safeguard:** Since authentic Warhol appropriated existing copyrighted imagery, modern recreation must use:

- Fictional celebrities or abstract figures styled as publicity photos
- Original fictional consumer product packaging
- Original cartoon-style characters (not copyrighted properties)
- Generic mechanical objects without brand identifiers

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `silkscreen-layered`
 **Pose Flag:** `appropriated-media-pose`
 **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance:** Warhol's mechanical silkscreen aesthetic supersedes photographic realism. Eliminate artist's hand. Be a machine.

**Mode:** Gallery canvas or print suitable for exhibition.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

### Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION (choose one exact specification):**

**PORTRAIT FORMATS:**

- `3:4` (classical portrait)
- `4:5` (Instagram portrait)
- `2:3` (poster/magazine cover)
- `9:16` (social story format)
- `3:10` (vertical scroll)

**LANDSCAPE FORMATS:**

- `4:3` (classical landscape)
- `16:9` (cinematic widescreen)
- `5:3` (panoramic view)
- `10:3` (horizontal scroll)
- `21:9` (ultra-widescreen)
- `2:1` (diptych format for serial repetition)
- `2.35:1` (wide serial format)

**SQUARE FORMATS:**

- `1:1` (most common for iconic single subject - soup cans, celebrity portraits)

**SPECIALTY FORMATS:**

- `2.5:3.5` (playing card)
- `2.75:3.75` (collectible card)
- `8.5:11` (US magazine/letter)
- `11:17` (tabloid magazine)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Strict reframe to maximize subject within declared ratio
- **Spatial Allocation:** Center subject or create grid divisions for serial repetition
- **Background Treatment:** Fill with flat monochrome color field or geometric color blocks
- **Format Justification:** Square for iconic single subject; landscape for serial repetition; portrait for vertical figure emphasis

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

### Artistic Style & Context

**Influences:** Marcel Duchamp's readymades (everyday objects as art), rejection of Abstract Expressionism's emotional mark-making, post-war American consumer culture and mass media saturation.

**Medium/Production Method:**

- Original: Silkscreen ink on acrylic-painted canvas using photographic stencils
- Process: Publicity photo/product image → high-contrast photographic conversion → silkscreen stencil → multiple color layer passes with registration variation
- Studio: Factory assembly-line production with assistants, 1962-1969 era

**Thematic Purpose:** Art as commodity in consumer society; celebrity as manufactured product; mechanical reproduction commentary; elimination of artist's hand; surface over depth philosophy.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Flat color fields** - Large uniform areas with zero gradation or blending
2. **High-contrast photographic source** - Image reduced to stark black shapes and white highlights
3. **Non-naturalistic pop colors** - Bold saturated hues (hot pink, electric blue, vibrant yellow) chosen for graphic impact
4. **Serial repetition with variation** - Same image repeated with different color treatments
5. **Graphic black outlines** - Bold contours created by high-contrast photography

**Period Framing:** 1962-1969 Factory era when Warhol perfected silkscreen technique for mass-producing art.

**Tone Tag:** Cool, detached, impersonal, mechanical, ironic, surface-focused.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Silkscreen printing on canvas with period-appropriate registration imperfections, uneven ink coverage, and mechanical reproduction artifacts.

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

### Technical Execution

### CRITICAL MECHANICAL REPRODUCTION MANDATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

**MANDATORY SILKSCREEN CHARACTERISTICS:** Image must exhibit authentic silkscreen printing process characteristics. Perfect digital smoothness is INAUTHENTIC. The following "flaws" are REQUIRED authentication elements:

- Registration drift between color layers (slight misalignment)
- Uneven ink coverage within color fields (texture variation)
- Visible halftone dot patterns in photographic areas
- Color layer separation creating dimensional effects

**PROHIBITED:** Any evidence of artist's hand - no brushstrokes, no blending, no painterly marks, no emotional expression through technique.

### Silkscreen Process Anchors (≥5 required):

1. **Flat uniform color fields** - Large areas of single color with NO gradation, blending, or tonal variation; each color zone completely uniform as if printed
2. **High-contrast photographic conversion** - Source image reduced to stark black shapes against white highlights with NO mid-tones; photographic detail simplified to graphic shapes
3. **Bold graphic outlines** - Strong black contour lines defining all forms, created by high-contrast photo process, not hand-drawn
4. **Registration imperfections REQUIRED** - Slight misalignment between color layers creating offset effect; colors not perfectly overlapping
5. **Uneven ink coverage texture** - Visible variation in ink density within color fields; some areas show canvas texture through ink, creating authentic mechanical reproduction character

### Color Treatment Anchors:

1. **Non-naturalistic pop palette** - Bold saturated colors chosen for graphic impact, NOT representational accuracy; hot pink skin, yellow hair, electric blue backgrounds, lime green shadows
2. **Limited color per layer** - Each silkscreen pass applies ONE flat color; typical palette 3-5 colors total including black outlines
3. **High saturation primacy** - Colors at maximum intensity; avoid muddy tones, earth tones, or subtle pastels
4. **Monochrome variations optional** - Single-color or grayscale versions for commentary on image fading/reproduction

### Photographic Source Treatment:

1. **Appropriated media image** - Subject derived from existing publicity photo, advertisement, or product packaging; NOT originally composed
2. **Tight cropping** - Billboard-style framing maximizing subject visibility; face/product fills 70-95% of frame
3. **Flattened perspective** - Zero illusionistic depth; complete rejection of atmospheric modeling or Renaissance space

### Serial Repetition Logic (if applicable):

1. **Grid organization** - Multiple repetitions arranged in strict orthogonal layout (2x2, 1x2, etc.)
2. **Color variation across instances** - Each repetition uses different color combination while maintaining identical composition
3. **Mechanical uniformity** - Repeated elements exactly same size and position, emphasizing assembly-line production

### Pose Anchors (if human subject):

1. **Head tilt 0-15 degrees** - Slight angle from appropriated publicity photo; avoid extreme tilts
2. **Shoulder-hip alignment** - Typically frontal or slight rotation; photographed pose, not staged
3. **Weight distribution** - As captured in source photo; no dynamic athletic poses
4. **Gesture economy** - Minimal hand gestures; poses are static publicity shots

### Canvas Adaptation Anchor:

1. **Composition optimized for declared aspect ratio** - Subject scaled and positioned to fill chosen format; serial repetitions divided evenly if grid layout; tight cropping maximizes subject presence within ratio
2. **Canvas substrate visible** - Silkscreen ink allows canvas texture to show through in areas; not opaque like house paint
3. **Layered transparency effects** - Where colors overlap, slight transparency or color mixing visible from printing process
4. **No digital perfection** - Image must feel mechanically printed, not computer-generated; authentic process artifacts throughout

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

### Fashion & Attire – Subject Matter Matrix

### Subject Categories (Choose One):

**CELEBRITY/FIGURE PORTRAITS:**

- **Source Type:** Appropriated publicity photograph or film still aesthetic
- **Pose Convention:** Pre-existing media pose (publicity shot, film still, performance photo); NOT staged by artist
- **Cropping:** Tight framing on face/upper body, billboard-style intimacy
- **Treatment:** Face flattened to graphic shapes, features defined by high-contrast black outlines
- **Wardrobe:** Period-appropriate 1960s styling; costume should read as "from publicity photo"
- **Fabric Behavior:** Flattened to graphic color fields; no realistic drape or texture modeling; simplified to solid color shapes
- **NO real celebrities:** Use fictional figure styled as iconic celebrity

**CONSUMER PRODUCTS:**

- **Source Type:** Commercial packaging or product design
- **Presentation:** Isolated against flat background with no environmental context
- **Typography:** Brand names/logos integral to composition, reproduced from fictional packaging design
- **Scale:** Product monumentalized to fill canvas like billboard
- **Material Physics:** Packaging rendered as flat graphic reproduction; no dimensional product photography lighting
- **Examples:** Soup can, soda bottle, food box, household item
- **NO real brands:** Create original fictional brand with period-appropriate graphic design

**MECHANICAL OBJECTS:**

- **Source Type:** Mass-produced manufactured items
- **Presentation:** Isolated on flat color field, single viewpoint
- **Treatment:** Serialized repetition emphasizing interchangeable nature
- **Surface Treatment:** Metallic or painted surfaces flattened to graphic color fields
- **Examples:** Cars, tools, machinery, currency
- **NO brand logos:** Generic or fictional manufacturer identifiers only

**CARTOON/POP CULTURE ICONS:**

- **Source Type:** Comic or animation character aesthetic
- **Treatment:** Flat graphic rendering with bold outlines
- **Presentation:** Character isolated on color field
- **Line Quality:** Bold black contours defining all forms
- **NO copyrighted characters:** Create original cartoon-style character

### Wardrobe & Styling (If Human Subject):

- **Period:** 1960s styling for authentic Warhol era
- **Approach:** Costume should suggest "publicity photograph" source
- **Detail Level:** Simplified to graphic shapes by high-contrast process; minimal clothing detail
- **Color Treatment:** Non-naturalistic flat colors per silkscreen aesthetic
- **Fabric Physics:** All fabric rendered as flat color fields; no realistic draping, folding, or texture; clothing exists as bold graphic shapes
- **Accessories:** Minimal; only if integral to iconic image

### Accessory Caps:

**Minimalist (0-2 accessories):** Typical for Warhol portraits - jewelry, glasses, or single iconic element only if essential to image recognition

**Props:**

- **Prop Limit:** Maximum 1 hero element if product/object subject
- **Treatment:** Props flattened to graphic shapes, same high-contrast process as main subject
- **Integration:** Props isolated against flat background, no spatial depth
- **Material Rendering:** All materials (metal, glass, fabric, plastic) rendered as flat graphic color fields with bold outlines

### Color Palette (Non-Naturalistic):

**Primary Pop Colors:** Hot pink, electric blue, vibrant yellow, bright red, lime green, orange
 **Avoid:** Realistic skin tones, natural hair colors, earth tones, muddy colors, subtle pastels
 **Background:** Flat monochrome field OR geometric color blocks (never atmospheric or environmental)

### Wardrobe Variation Required:

Change color treatments between iterations if creating serial work; cycle through non-naturalistic pop palette avoiding identical color repetition across multiple versions.

### Coherence Filter:

All costume and styling elements must support 1960s Pop Art appropriation aesthetic; avoid contemporary fashion or styling that would break period authenticity. Fallback = simplified iconic figure in bold single-color outfit against contrasting flat background.

------

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

### Constraints

### Canvas Negatives (MANDATORY AVOIDANCE):

**Ratio-Specific Anti-Patterns:**

- "original aspect ratio"
- "source dimensions"

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

### Composition & Background

### Ratio-Specific Composition:

**For Square (1:1):**

- Central subject placement with bilateral symmetry
- Subject occupies 75-90% of canvas
- Iconic presentation like product photography

**For Landscape (Serial Repetition):**

- Grid divisions (2, 3, or 4 panels across)
- Each panel contains identical subject with color variation
- Strict orthogonal organization

**For Portrait (Vertical):**

- Vertical emphasis with tight cropping
- Head/shoulders fill frame
- Minimal negative space

### Style-Specific Composition:

- **Perspective regime:** FLAT - complete rejection of illusionistic depth; no atmospheric perspective, no vanishing points, no spatial recession
- **Grid/symmetry:** Bilateral symmetry for iconic subjects; strict orthogonal grid for serial works
- **Figure:ground ratio:** 70-95% subject dominance; background minimal
- **Density:** Subject fills frame with billboard-scale presence
- **Lighting logic:** Flat frontal lighting eliminating dimensional modeling; high-contrast conversion removes all mid-tones
- **Detail:negative space:** Maximum subject visibility, minimal empty space

### Background Treatment:

**Primary Options:**

- Flat monochrome color field (single solid color behind subject)
- Geometric color blocks (two or more flat color zones creating abstract division)
- **NEVER:** Environmental context, landscape, interior space, atmospheric effects, gradated backgrounds

**Background Colors:** Bold saturated hues contrasting with subject - turquoise, pink, yellow, green, blue, red

### Required Anchors:

**Surface Context Anchor:** Canvas with silkscreen ink application; substrate texture visible through ink

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT ENTIRELY - No frames, borders, or decorative bands outside canvas edge

**Production Context Anchor:** 1960s silkscreen printing on canvas with Factory assembly-line production aesthetic; mechanical reproduction with characteristic registration and ink imperfections

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed for declared aspect ratio with subject scaled to fill format; serial repetitions divided evenly across canvas if grid format

### Spatial Logic:

- **Subject isolation:** Remove all environmental context; subject exists in graphic void
- **Commercial advertising logic:** Frame like product photograph or billboard
- **No narrative:** Eliminate storytelling elements; present icon without context
- **Mechanical organization:** Grid-based serial works show assembly-line regularity

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Typography Policy:** CONDITIONAL - Only if subject is consumer product with brand identity

### If Product Subject:

**Typography Treatment:**

- **Ratio-Appropriate Zones:** Text positioned within declared aspect ratio following packaging design hierarchy
- **Copy Limits:** ≤6 words per line for brand names; ≤7 total text elements if complex packaging
- **Source:** Appropriated directly from fictional product packaging design
- **Integration:** Typography is integral part of image, not added caption
- **Style:** Reproduce packaging fonts exactly; script logos, sans-serif brand names, etc.
- **Silkscreen Process:** Text subject to same registration drift and ink variation as image
- **Examples:** "Campbell's" script, "TOMATO SOUP" sans-serif, decorative flourishes from label design

**Period-Appropriate Typography:**

- 1960s commercial typography conventions
- Script fonts for brand names (simulate hand-lettered quality)
- Bold sans-serif for product descriptions
- Typography must appear printed, not hand-drawn

**Font Recommendation Format:**

- Closest Google Font: **[Name]** ([Description], [Similarity %])
- Better (if archival): **[Professional Font Family]**
- Example: "Closest Google Font: Lobster (script logo analog, 80%). Better: House Industries Script"

**Production Method Integration:**

- Typography rendered with silkscreen registration imperfections
- Slight ink bleed or misalignment characteristic of 1960s printing
- Text integrated into color layer sequence

### If Celebrity/Figure Subject:

**Typography Policy:** OMIT ALL TEXT

No captions, no names, no dates, no titles. Image speaks entirely through visual icon.

### If Cartoon Character Subject:

**Typography Policy:** OPTIONAL - May include character name if integral to design

Treat text as graphic element with bold simple letterforms following ≤6 words per line limit.

**Format-Specific Text Rules:**

- **Gallery print mode:** Omit text entirely
- **Product subject mode:** Typography essential and integral
- **Serial repetition mode:** Text may appear once or repeat across all panels

------

**END OF FRAMEWORK**

*This framework is constructed from evidence-based visual analysis of 9 authentic Andy Warhol silkscreen works from his 1962-1969 Factory era, representing his definitive Pop Art style. All technical specifications and compositional rules derived from systematic forensic examination of Campbell's Soup Cans (1962), Marilyn Monroe portraits (1962-1967), Elvis (1963), Mercedes-Benz race cars (1986 style but 60s technique), Mickey Mouse (1981 but representative), and commissioned portrait work showing his characteristic silkscreen process.*
