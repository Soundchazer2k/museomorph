  Johannes Vermeer bathed modest Delft rooms in camera-obscura light‚Äîlapis
  underpaint, pointill√© sparkles, and window-cooled silence. His compositions
  balance everyday gestures with optical magic. MuseoMorph keeps that luminous
  hush while swapping in fresh households, maps, and props.

# Johannes Vermeer Museum-Grade Prompt Framework v1.0

**Version:** 1.0
 **Purpose:** A comprehensive scaffold for generating authentic Vermeer-style paintings based on documented 17th-century Dutch Golden Age techniques, materials, and optical methods.

------

## üîß Vermeer-Specific Renderer Configuration

- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always recompose to exact Vermeer proportions - ignore source dimensions
- **Optical Authority:** Camera obscura effects take precedence over conventional painting logic
- **Material Authenticity:** Hand-ground pigments bound with linseed oil on prepared canvas only
- **Light Dominance:** Northern window light controls all modeling and shadow placement
- **Ultramarine Priority:** Natural lapis lazuli blue (most expensive pigment) used abundantly as underpainting
- **Pointill√© Authorization:** Globular light dots mandatory for specular highlights
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean` with `glazing-layers-buildup`
- **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` or `psychological-tension`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend`
- **Process-Over-Result:** 17th-century Netherlands painting methods supersede visual description

------

## üìã Vermeer Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[ratio]** using Vermeer's documented proportions
- Redraw in **Dutch Golden Age domestic interior style** for **intimate genre painting**
- Identity via gesture, fabric drape, and lighting rather than facial detail
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original 17th-century Dutch domestic scene avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Optical Enhancement:** Camera obscura viewing effects implemented throughout
- Face-Treatment: `oil-fat-over-lean` with `glazing-layers-buildup`
- Pose: `candid-motion` (daily activities) or `psychological-tension` (contemplative moments)
- Canvas Control: `adaptive-extend`
- **Style Dominance:** Vermeer's documented techniques override all contemporary methods

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION (Vermeer-documented formats):**

**PRIMARY VERMEER RATIOS:**

- `3:4` (Woman Holding a Balance, Girl with Pearl Earring) - intimate portrait mode
- `4:5` (The Milkmaid, Girl with Red Hat) - close domestic scenes
- `4:3` (The Art of Painting, Officer and Laughing Girl) - room interiors
- `5:4` (Music Lesson, Lady Standing at Virginal) - horizontal room scenes

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** extend-interior-architecture with period-appropriate elements
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject placement according to Vermeer's documented compositions
- **Background Treatment:** Delft interior walls with warm buff ground visible
- **Format Justification:** Chosen ratio serves intimate Dutch domestic interior tradition

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Northern European naturalism, Utrecht Caravaggisti chiaroscuro, Delft perspective traditions
- **Medium/Production:** Oil on canvas with chalk-lead-white-umber ground preparation, linseed oil binding
- **Thematic Purpose:** Capture transient domestic moments with supernatural luminosity
- **Hallmark Motifs:**
  - Northern window light (single-source illumination from upper left)
  - Ultramarine-blue fabric modeling with 3-5mm paint thickness
  - Pointill√© highlights (2-4mm globular white paint dots on reflective surfaces)
  - Delft floor tiles with 15-20% visible aged ground between pigment areas
  - Maps, musical instruments, and domestic vessels as cultural markers
- **Period Framing:** Dutch Golden Age domestic interior, c. 1650-1670
- **Tone Tag:** Contemplative-luminous with optical precision

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**CANVAS PREPARATION (Required Foundation):**

- Ground layer: chalk + lead-white + linseed oil + raw umber (warm buff tone)
- Canvas weave: medium-weight linen with visible texture through thin paint areas
- Double ground application where color adjustment needed

**UNDERPAINTING SEQUENCE:**

- Initial sketch: transparent dark brown (burnt umber + oil) for composition outline
- Dead coloring: monochrome brown modeling to establish light/shadow structure
- Flesh underpainting: red lake mixture for warm undertones
- Ultramarine undercoating: expensive lapis lazuli blue beneath earth colors for chromatic harmony

**WORKING-UP TECHNIQUE:**

- Fat-over-lean oil application (increasing oil content in successive layers)
- Limited daily palette: 3-5 hand-ground pigments per session
- Wet-into-wet blending for atmospheric effects
- Brush handle scratching to reveal under-layers for texture

**OPTICAL EFFECTS:**

- Camera obscura characteristics: exaggerated size relationships, shallow depth of field
- Circles of confusion: unfocused highlights rendered as soft glowing orbs
- Pointill√© technique: 2-4mm white paint drops applied wet-into-wet for specular highlights
- Halation effects: light diffusion around bright objects

**PIGMENT SPECIFICATIONS:**

- **Natural Ultramarine:** Pure lapis lazuli, hand-ground, used abundantly for underpainting and blue elements
- **Lead-tin Yellow:** Bright, durable yellow for illuminated fabrics
- **Vermilion:** Mercury sulfide red for warm accents
- **Madder Lake:** Transparent red glaze for fabric shadows and flesh warmth
- **Lead White:** Titanium-free historic white for highlights and mixing
- **Raw Umber:** Earth brown for sketching and warm shadows
- **Ivory Black:** Bone char black, limited use

**GLAZING TECHNIQUE:**

- Transparent color layers over dried underpainting
- Madder lake glazes over ultramarine for purple effects
- Natural ultramarine glazes for deepening blues
- Oil-to-pigment ratio optimized for transparency

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**AUTHENTIC PERIOD WARDROBE:**

- **Women:** Linen caps/head coverings, wool bodices with lacing, linen chemises, wool skirts
- **Men:** Doublets, breeches, linen shirts, felt hats, leather shoes
- **Fabric Physics:** Wool drape (heavy vertical fall), linen texture (visible weave), silk sheen (light reflection)
- **Construction Methods:** Hand-sewn seams, bone or wooden buttons, tied lacings
- **Color Palette:** Indigo blues, madder reds, weld yellows, natural white linens, umber browns

**AUTHENTIC DUTCH PROPS (Maximum 2):**

```yaml
Musical_Instruments: [virginal, lute, recorder, sheet_music]
Domestic_Vessels: [ceramic_pitcher, pewter_plates, glass_wine_roemer, delft_blue_bowl]

```

**COLOR AUTHENTICITY:** All pigments must be period-available: no chromium, cadmium, or synthetic colors

------
## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**‚ùå Canvas Negatives (Anti-Modern Elements):**

- "contemporary fashion", "modern lighting", "electric illumination", "synthetic pigments"
- "harsh shadows", "multiple light sources", "photographic depth of field"
- "smooth paint surface", "airbrush effects", "digital perfection"
- "bright primary colors", "saturated hues", "poster paint appearance"

**‚úÖ Canvas Positives (Required Vermeer Elements):**

- "exactly [declared ratio]", "Dutch Golden Age proportions", "intimate domestic scale"
- "northern window light", "camera obscura depth effects", "optical viewing characteristics"
- "hand-ground pigment texture", "visible brush marks in thick passages", "glazing transparency"
- "ultramarine underpainting", "pointill√© highlights", "warm ground tone visible"
- "17th-century Netherlands interior authenticity", "period-accurate materials only"

------
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**VERMEER-SPECIFIC SPATIAL RULES:**

**LIGHTING LOGIC (Mandatory):**

- Single northern window as primary light source (upper left quadrant)
- Gradual light falloff creating atmospheric perspective
- Cast shadows following documented angle (45-60 degrees from window)
- Reflected light from walls creating secondary illumination

**INTERIOR ARCHITECTURE:**

- Delft domestic interior with plastered walls
- Visible structural elements: ceiling beams, window frames, floor tiles
- Wall color: warm buff tone (ground layer visible through thin paint)
- Floor: geometric tile patterns with perspective accuracy
- Windows: leaded glass with realistic light transmission

**FIGURE COMPOSITION:**

- Subject placement respecting camera obscura proportional relationships
- Foreground figures significantly larger than background elements
- Shallow depth of field with selective focus areas
- Balance between figure dominance (60-70%) and environmental context

**OPTICAL PERSPECTIVE:**

- Camera obscura viewing characteristics: compressed tonal range
- Exaggerated size relationships from optical projection
- Subtle optical distortions at frame edges
- Atmospheric perspective through tonal gradation

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context:** Interior plaster walls with warm undertone
- **Light Source:** Northern window with period-accurate glass and leading
- **Floor Treatment:** Geometric tiles with mathematical perspective accuracy
- **Atmospheric Depth:** Gradual tonal compression from foreground to background

------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**TEXT INTEGRATION POLICY:** Minimal and period-authentic only

**IF TEXT PERMITTED:**

- **Historical Accuracy:** Latin inscriptions, Dutch phrases, or musical notation only
- **Period Typography:** Hand-lettered script or carved inscriptions appropriate to 1650-1670
- **Integration Method:** Text as painted elements within the scene (book pages, letters, maps)
- **Placement:** Never dominant, always supporting compositional elements
- **Material Authenticity:** Ink/paint rendering consistent with period methods

**DECORATIVE ELEMENTS:**

- Wall maps with period-accurate cartography and hand-coloring
- Paintings-within-paintings showing contemporary artistic styles
- Musical notation on authentic period compositions
- Ceramic decorations with Delft blue-and-white patterns
- Persian carpet motifs with authentic weaving patterns

**HISTORICAL VALIDATION:**

- All decorative elements documented from 17th-century Netherlands sources
- No anachronistic symbols, text, or imagery
- Cultural authenticity maintained throughout
