about: >
  Rembrandt carved faces out of darkness with impasto light and umber glazes,
  letting every wrinkle broadcast a life lived. His Amsterdam studio prized
  empathy over polish. We follow that chiaroscuro ritual while inventing sitters
  and regalia from the same gilded age.

# Rembrandt van Rijn Oil Painting Prompt - Dutch Golden Age Master
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely. Redraw in **Dutch Golden Age oil painting technique circa 1630-1669** for **classical portrait format**. Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression. **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original portrait design avoiding copyrighted elements appropriate to 17th-century Dutch painting style. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean` **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style Dominance:** Rembrandt's revolutionary chiaroscuro and impasto technique supersedes photographic accuracy. **Mode Selector:** gallery portrait

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `3:4` (classical portrait)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with atmospheric background
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned in upper two-thirds with dramatic lighting from left
- **Background Treatment:** Extend warm, neutral brown-grey atmospheric depth to fill 3:4 ratio
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio matches Rembrandt's preferred portrait proportions, allowing psychological intimacy while accommodating his signature dramatic lighting scheme

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Dutch Golden Age portraiture, Caravaggio's chiaroscuro, Titian's impasto innovations
- **Medium/Production method:** Oil on canvas with double-ground preparation - reddish-brown base layer beneath lighter topcoat of lead white mixed with umber, creating reddish-gray surface optimal for chiaroscuro effects
- **Thematic purpose:** Psychological penetration and emotional truth through masterful light manipulation
- **3-5 hallmark motifs:** Dramatic single-source lighting (150% contrast ratio), thick impasto highlights (3-5mm paint thickness), transparent shadow glazes, warm earth-tone palette dominance, penetrating psychological gaze
- **Period framing:** Dutch Republic 1630-1669, Protestant Reformation context, bourgeois patronage system
- **Tone Tag:** contemplative-intense
- **Production Era Authenticity:** 17th-century Dutch oil painting methods with hand-ground pigments, linseed oil medium, canvas preparation using traditional chalk/quartz grounds

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line quality:** Invisible drawing foundation with brown oil paint underdrawing, fluid brushwork varying from precise detail to loose atmospheric treatment
- **Color mixing methods:** Alla prima in lights, glazing technique in shadows, limited palette of earth tones (burnt sienna, raw umber, yellow ochre) with lead white and vermilion accents
- **Texture thickness:** Heavy impasto in highlights (3-5mm) created with lead white and lead-tin yellow, smooth glazed shadows using transparent browns
- **Edge treatment:** Lost and found edges with soft atmospheric transitions, sharp light-shadow boundaries
- **Stroke economy:** Economic brushwork with loaded bristle brushes, palette knife texture in thick passages
- **Surface depth:** Double-ground canvas preparation creating middle-tone working surface, glazes over dried impasto for optical depth
- **Detail hierarchy:** Sharp focus on facial features and hands (90% detail concentration), atmospheric dissolution in backgrounds (30% detail)
- **Material simulation:** Authentic oil paint characteristics - slow drying, translucent glazes, opaque impastos

**Pose Anchors:** Head tilted 15 degrees, shoulder-hip angle differential 25 degrees, weight distribution 70% to one side, contemplative hand gesture with visible tension

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Natural proportions with subtle psychological emphasis - eyes 110% intensity, hands 105% presence

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Surface exhibits genuine oil paint characteristics - visible brushstrokes in impasto, smooth blending in flesh tones, crackling patterns in aged paint film

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All technical elements match documented 17th-century Dutch methods - ground preparation, pigment selection, application techniques

**Production Method Anchor:** Traditional oil painting methods including fat-over-lean principle, glazing over impasto, heat-bodied oil medium

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 3:4 portrait format with single-source lighting scheme designed for vertical emphasis

------
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks:** 17th-century Dutch adult attire with period-accurate construction **Fabric behavior:** Heavy wool and silk with natural drape, linen collars with crisp folding, rich velvet with deep pile texture showing authentic weaving patterns **Accessory caps:** Minimalist 1-2 items - white linen collar, simple jewelry with period metalwork **Color palette:** Restricted to earth tones and deep jewel colors available in 17th-century Holland - burnt umber, raw sienna, deep crimson, ivory white, charcoal black **Wardrobe variation required:** Rich brown doublet with white linen collar, avoiding repeated color schemes **Props:** Single prop - leather-bound book OR ornate goblet (total ≤1) with authentic 17th-century craftsmanship

**YAML prop pools:**

```yaml
scholarly:
  - leather-bound folio with brass clasps
  - quill pen with ink pot
  - rolled parchment with red wax seal
domestic:
  - silver chalice with engraved surface
  - ornate brass candlestick
  - carved wooden cross
```

------
## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**⌘ Canvas Negatives (≥2):**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "modern photographic lighting", "digital smoothing effects", "contemporary costume elements", "synthetic paint appearance"

**✅ Canvas Positives (≥2):**

- "exactly 3:4 ratio", "recomposed for classical portrait format", "authentic 17th-century Dutch oil technique", "hand-ground pigment appearance", "traditional canvas preparation visible", "period-accurate chiaroscuro lighting"

**Vocabulary warnings:** Avoid "smooth", "perfect", "modern", "photographic", "digital" - emphasize "painterly", "atmospheric", "luminous", "psychological"

------
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**PORTRAIT RATIO COMPOSITION (3:4):** Vertical emphasis with subject dominance ≥75%, hierarchical staging optimized for intimate viewing distance

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective regime:** Single-point perspective with atmospheric perspective in backgrounds, following Dutch Golden Age conventions
- **Grid/symmetry:** Informal triangular composition with psychological weight, avoiding rigid mathematical placement
- **Figure:ground %:** 75% figure presence, 25% atmospheric background with warm brown-grey tones
- **Density %:** 85% detail concentration in upper two-thirds, optimized for 3-foot viewing distance
- **Lighting logic:** Single dramatic light source from upper left at 45-degree angle, creating 60% shadow area with transparent glazes
- **Detail:negative space:** 70% detailed rendering in focal areas, 30% atmospheric dissolution maintaining 3:4 vertical emphasis

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Prepared linen canvas with traditional double-ground surface showing authentic texture
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely - pure painterly surface without decorative borders
- **Production Context Anchor:** 17th-century Dutch studio methods with natural daylight and oil paint medium
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for 3:4 portrait format with vertical lighting emphasis

------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit

Typography omitted entirely - pure painted surface without text elements, following traditional Dutch portrait conventions.
