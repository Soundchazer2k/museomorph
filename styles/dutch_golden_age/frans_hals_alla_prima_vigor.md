about: >
  Frans Hals painted like a jazz solo—loaded brush, one-take bravado, and
  laughter still wet on the canvas. His Haarlem patrons appear mid-toast,
  mid-song, mid-life. MuseoMorph channels that bravura while inventing new
  revelers and tavern props.

# Frans Hals Oil Painting Prompt - Dutch Golden Age Master of Alla Prima
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely. Redraw in **Frans Hals alla prima technique circa 1610-1666** for **classical portrait format**. Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression with characteristic vitality and movement. **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original portrait design avoiding copyrighted elements appropriate to 17th-century Dutch painting style. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `alla-prima-direct` **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style Dominance:** Frans Hals' revolutionary loose brushwork and spontaneous vitality supersedes photographic accuracy. **Mode Selector:** gallery portrait

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `3:4` (classical portrait)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with dynamic atmospheric background
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned dynamically with 15-degree tilt, avoiding static centering
- **Background Treatment:** Extend neutral grey-brown atmosphere with loose, gestural brushwork to fill 3:4 ratio
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio optimal for Hals' animated portrait style, allowing full gestural expression and dynamic pose within traditional proportions

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Dutch Golden Age bourgeois portraiture, revolutionary alla prima technique, Spanish masters encountered in Antwerp (Rubens influence)
- **Medium/Production method:** Oil on canvas with immediate direct painting - minimal underpainting, alla prima execution with quick decisive brushstrokes, chalk/pink grey undercoat for luminosity
- **Thematic purpose:** Capture living personality and social vitality of Dutch merchant class through dynamic brushwork
- **3-5 hallmark motifs:** Lightning-fast visible brushstrokes, warm flesh tones with vivid touches, blue-green shadow passages, candid animated expressions, loose gestural clothing treatment with fabric suggestion rather than detail
- **Period framing:** Dutch Republic Golden Age 1610-1666, Protestant merchant culture, Haarlem civic guard society
- **Tone Tag:** spirited-animated
- **Production Era Authenticity:** 17th-century Dutch alla prima methods with immediate wet-on-wet application, minimal drying time between applications

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line quality:** Minimal initial drawing with brush and thin brown paint, emphasis on direct paint application with loaded brush techniques
- **Color mixing methods:** Wet-on-wet blending, quick color suggestions rather than precise mixing, earth palette with vivid accent touches
- **Texture thickness:** Varied impasto - thin in shadows (1-2mm), moderate loading in lights (2-4mm), visible brush hair marks and directional strokes
- **Edge treatment:** Broken, lost-and-found edges with atmospheric dissolution, sharp accents only in focal areas
- **Stroke economy:** Maximum expression with minimum brushstrokes, loaded brush technique, confident single-pass application
- **Surface depth:** Minimal grey-pink underpainting showing through, immediate paint application creating optical mixing
- **Detail hierarchy:** 95% energy in facial expression and gesture, 40% detail in clothing (suggested fabric rather than rendered), 20% background completion
- **Material simulation:** Authentic alla prima oil characteristics - wet-into-wet blending, spontaneous mark-making, visible painting process

**Pose Anchors:** Head animated tilt 10-20 degrees, shoulder-hip rotation creating dynamic line, hand gestures mid-motion, weight shift suggesting movement

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Natural proportions with emphasis on expressive features - eyes 120% intensity through brushwork energy, hands 110% gestural presence

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Surface exhibits genuine alla prima characteristics - visible brush loading, wet-blend transitions, spontaneous mark confidence

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All technical elements match documented Hals methods - quick execution, minimal underpainting, direct color application

**Production Method Anchor:** Authentic alla prima wet-on-wet technique with single-session energy and paint handling confidence

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Dynamic composition optimized for 3:4 portrait format with animated pose suited to vertical emphasis

------
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks:** 17th-century Dutch merchant class attire with period-accurate construction but loose, lived-in presentation **Fabric behavior:** Natural fabric drape and movement - silk with lustrous highlights, wool with soft texture, linen collars with casual positioning rather than stiff formality **Accessory caps:** Minimalist 1-2 items - white lace collar, simple hat OR modest jewelry with period metalwork **Color palette:** Hals' characteristic range - warm flesh tones, earth browns, vivid accent colors (vermillion, yellow ochre), blue-green shadows, crisp whites **Wardrobe variation required:** Rich costume variety - black doublets with lace, colorful slashed sleeves, casual outdoor wear, avoiding repetitive formal poses **Props:** Single dynamic prop - musical instrument OR glass/cup OR letter (total ≤1) suggesting animation and social activity

**YAML prop pools:**

```yaml
musical:
  - lute with visible strings
  - simple flute or recorder
  - sheet music with visible notes
social:
  - wine glass half-raised
  - ceramic jug or tankard
  - playing cards in hand
scholarly:
  - letter being read
  - small book held casually
  - writing quill in motion
```

------
## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**⌘ Canvas Negatives (≥2):**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "static formal pose", "meticulous detail rendering", "smooth blended finish", "photographic precision", "tight controlled brushwork"

**✅ Canvas Positives (≥2):**

- "exactly 3:4 ratio", "recomposed for classical portrait format", "authentic alla prima technique", "visible confident brushstrokes", "wet-on-wet paint application", "spontaneous energetic execution", "Frans Hals characteristic looseness"

**Vocabulary warnings:** Avoid "polished", "refined", "detailed", "finished" - emphasize "spontaneous", "vigorous", "animated", "confident", "loose"

------
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**PORTRAIT RATIO COMPOSITION (3:4):** Vertical emphasis with dynamic subject placement ≥70%, animated staging avoiding rigid symmetry

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective regime:** Slight foreshortening creating dynamic presence, avoiding flat frontal presentation
- **Grid/symmetry:** Asymmetrical dynamic balance with energetic pose lines
- **Figure:ground %:** 75% figure dominance, 25% atmospheric background with loose neutral tones
- **Density %:** 90% energy in upper two-thirds, optimized for immediate viewing impact at 4-foot distance
- **Lighting logic:** Natural daylight from window source, creating warm flesh modeling with blue-green shadow passages
- **Detail:negative space:** 80% expressive brushwork in focal areas, 20% atmospheric suggestion maintaining 3:4 vertical flow

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Prepared canvas with minimal grey-pink ground showing through paint layers
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely - pure alla prima painted surface without decorative elements
- **Production Context Anchor:** 17th-century Haarlem studio methods with direct daylight and immediate oil technique
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Dynamic composition designed specifically for 3:4 portrait format emphasizing animated character

------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit

Typography omitted entirely - pure alla prima painted surface without text elements, following Hals' portrait conventions focusing on pure painterly expression.
