# Renaissance Stained Glass

**Version:** 4.2 Renaissance Specialized **Purpose:** Comprehensive framework for generating authentic Renaissance stained glass artwork with naturalistic techniques, classical perspective, and period-accurate humanistic aesthetics (1400-1600).

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via naturalistic portraiture and Renaissance humanistic ideals.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("3mm silver stain width", "60% clear glass ratio") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Renaissance glass painting techniques and classical perspective systems supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Humanistic Authority:** Renaissance artistic philosophy and classical aesthetics take precedence over medieval conventions.
- **Period Authenticity Mandate:** 15th-16th century production methods and aesthetic innovations are mandatory.

**Face-Treatment Flag (mandatory):** `tempera-precise` with naturalistic modeling **Pose Flag (mandatory):** `contrapposto` or `candid-motion` (Renaissance naturalism) **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` or `strict-reframe` **Material Physics Authority:** Silver stain application, detailed vitreous paint work, and clear glass integration specifications override aesthetic preferences. **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Church and civic building viewing distances affect detail precision and paint application (1-2mm line work). **Renaissance Production Authenticity:** Guild workshop methods and humanistic artistic principles take precedence. **Quantifiers authoritative:** Paint layer thickness, perspective measurements, and glass ratios are binding. **Text policy:** Latin, vernacular inscriptions, and heraldic mottos when Section 8 authorizes. **Safety/IP:** Appropriate classical and biblical nudity within artistic context; no modern anachronisms. **Renaissance wardrobe guardrail:** Period-accurate 15th-16th century fashion, classical drapery, contemporary armor. **Gender expression:** Renaissance artistic and social conventions. **Material authenticity:** Authentic Renaissance glass painting techniques with silver stain and detailed paint work. **Composition boundaries:** Clear architectural and perspective framework defines compositional elements. **Classical integration:** Windows must reflect Renaissance artistic philosophy and architectural harmony. **Humanistic coherence:** All elements serve Renaissance ideals of beauty, proportion, and naturalism. **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

- Redraw in **Renaissance Stained Glass** for **[classical window format]**.
- Identity via naturalistic portraiture, classical gestures, and Renaissance artistic ideals.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original Renaissance designs avoiding copyrighted elements while maintaining period accuracy.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `tempera-precise` with naturalistic modeling
- **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto` with classical gestures
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` for architectural integration
- **Renaissance Style Dominance:** Classical artistic principles and humanistic ideals override medieval conventions.
- **Mode Selector:** Church window, civic commission, donor memorial, or classical narrative panel.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION (Renaissance architectural specifications):**

**PORTRAIT FORMATS (Classical Windows):**

- `3:4` (Renaissance church standard)
- `2:3` (civic building format)

**LANDSCAPE FORMATS (Clerestory/Narrative):**

- `4:3` (classical landscape orientation)
- `5:3` (narrative sequence standard)
- `16:9` (wide civic narrative)

**SQUARE FORMATS (Memorial/Donor):**

- `1:1` (donor portrait medallions)
- `1:1` (heraldic compositions)

**SPECIALTY FORMATS:**

- `8.5:11` (manuscript-influenced)
- `5:7` (classical golden ratio approximation)
- Arched formats with Renaissance tracery

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Classical Framework Method:** Renaissance perspective system defines spatial structure
- **Proportional Harmony:** Golden ratio and classical proportions govern layout
- **Architectural Integration:** Window design serves Renaissance building aesthetics
