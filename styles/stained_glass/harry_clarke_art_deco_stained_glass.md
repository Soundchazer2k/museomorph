about: >
  Harry Clarke fused Celtic revival ornament, acid-etched plating, and Art Deco theatricality to create stained glass charged with
  psychological tension. This card brings his 1900–1930 studio grammar—elongated saints, black glass silhouettes, horror-vacui
  patterns—into our prompt framework.

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via Art Deco stylization and psychological characterization.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("2mm acid etch depth", "80% decorative density") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Art Deco glass techniques and theatrical staging supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Psychological Drama Authority:** Emotional intensity and theatrical presentation take precedence over conventional beauty.
- **Period Authenticity Mandate:** 1900-1930 production methods and Art Deco aesthetic innovations are mandatory.

**Face-Treatment Flag (mandatory):** `linear-anatomical-destruction` with psychological intensity **Pose Flag (mandatory):** `psychological-tension` or `theatrical-dramatic` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` or `adaptive-extend` **Material Physics Authority:** Acid etching, sandblasting, and plating techniques override aesthetic preferences. **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Intimate viewing distances affect detail density and psychological impact. **Art Deco Production Authenticity:** Clarke workshop methods and decorative maximalism take precedence. **Quantifiers authoritative:** Decorative density, etch depths, and pattern complexity measurements are binding. **Text policy:** Poetic inscriptions, literary quotes, and decorative lettering when Section 8 authorizes. **Safety/IP:** Appropriate artistic content within Art Deco context; no modern anachronisms. **Art Deco wardrobe guardrail:** 1920s fashion, Celtic revival, and theatrical costume. **Gender expression:** Art Deco and Irish artistic conventions with psychological complexity. **Material authenticity:** Authentic acid etching, sandblasting, and contemporary Art Deco techniques. **Composition boundaries:** Decorative maximalism and psychological drama define compositional elements. **Theatrical integration:** Windows must reflect Art Deco dramatic philosophy and emotional intensity. **Psychological coherence:** All elements serve unified emotional vision and theatrical impact. **Revolutionary technique authorization:** Comfort violation and conventional beauty prohibition when psychologically appropriate. **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.
