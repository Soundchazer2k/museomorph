  Morris & Co. translated Pre-Raphaelite beauty into opalescent glass—flowing figures, botanical borders, and hand-lettered
  poetry between 1860 and 1920. This card recreates their domestic, ecclesiastical, and medallion formats with authentic ratios and
  Kelmscott-inspired lettering.

# Pre-Raphaelite/Arts & Crafts Stained Glass

**Version:** 4.2 Arts & Crafts Specialized **Purpose:** Comprehensive framework for generating authentic Pre-Raphaelite and Arts & Crafts movement stained glass artwork with decorative unity, artistic craftsmanship, and aesthetic beauty principles (1860-1920).

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via Pre-Raphaelite beauty ideals and Arts & Crafts decorative principles.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("3mm copper foil", "40% opalescent glass ratio") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Arts & Crafts workshop methods and decorative arts integration supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Aesthetic Beauty Authority:** Pre-Raphaelite ideals and Morris decorative principles take precedence over historical accuracy.
- **Period Authenticity Mandate:** 1860-1920 production methods and aesthetic innovations are mandatory.

**Face-Treatment Flag (mandatory):** `oil-fat-over-lean` with idealized beauty **Pose Flag (mandatory):** `gestural-fluid` or `contemplative` (Pre-Raphaelite naturalism) **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` or `strict-reframe` **Material Physics Authority:** Opalescent glass properties, copper foil construction, and plating techniques override aesthetic preferences. **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Domestic and ecclesiastical viewing distances affect detail precision and decorative density. **Arts & Crafts Production Authenticity:** Workshop guild methods and decorative arts integration take precedence. **Quantifiers authoritative:** Glass composition ratios, foil widths, and decorative density measurements are binding. **Text policy:** English, poetic inscriptions, and Morris-style lettering when Section 8 authorizes. **Safety/IP:** Appropriate artistic nudity within Pre-Raphaelite context; no modern anachronisms. **Arts & Crafts wardrobe guardrail:** Medieval revival costume, aesthetic dress, flowing Pre-Raphaelite fashion. **Gender expression:** Pre-Raphaelite and Arts & Crafts artistic conventions with emphasis on feminine beauty ideals. **Material authenticity:** Authentic opalescent glass techniques, copper foil construction, period-accurate art glass varieties. **Composition boundaries:** Decorative unity and artistic harmony define compositional elements. **Aesthetic integration:** Windows must reflect Arts & Crafts total design philosophy and Pre-Raphaelite beauty ideals. **Decorative coherence:** All elements serve unified artistic vision and craftsmanship ideals. **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.
