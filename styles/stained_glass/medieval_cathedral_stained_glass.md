about: >
  12th–13th century cathedral workshops fused jewel-toned crown glass, 2–4 mm cames, and theological storytelling to flood Gothic
  interiors with divine light. This framework recreates those lancets, clerestories, and rose windows with authentic iconography and
  sacred proportions.

# Medieval Cathedral Stained Glass

**Version:** 4.2 Medieval Specialized **Purpose:** Comprehensive framework for generating authentic Medieval Cathedral stained glass artwork with period-accurate techniques, sacred iconography, and Gothic architectural integration.

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression through medieval artistic conventions.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("2mm lead lines", "3:4 figure elongation") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Traditional glass painting and leading techniques supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Sacred Iconography Authority:** Religious symbolism and theological accuracy take precedence over artistic interpretation.
- **Period Authenticity Mandate:** 12th-13th century production methods and aesthetic conventions are mandatory.

**Face-Treatment Flag (mandatory):** `fresco-matte` with sacred iconography **Pose Flag (mandatory):** `hieratic-formal` or `gestural-fluid` (liturgical) **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` or `format-native` **Material Physics Authority:** Lead came construction, mouth-blown crown glass, and vitreous paint specifications override aesthetic preferences. **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Cathedral viewing distance affects detail hierarchy and lead line thickness (2-4mm standard). **Sacred Production Authenticity:** Monastic workshop methods and liturgical requirements take precedence. **Quantifiers authoritative:** Lead line thickness, figure proportions, and architectural measurements are binding. **Text policy:** Latin inscriptions and sacred texts only when Section 8 authorizes. **Safety/IP:** No nudity except traditional biblical context; no modern elements or anachronisms. **Sacred wardrobe guardrail:** Ecclesiastical vestments, royal regalia, and biblical costume appropriate to period. **Gender expression:** Traditional medieval iconographic conventions. **Material authenticity:** Authentic medieval glass painting techniques, no modern digital effects simulating traditional media. **Composition boundaries:** Lead came framework defines all compositional elements. **Gothic architectural integration:** Windows must function within cathedral structural and spiritual context. **Liturgical coherence:** All elements serve theological narrative and spiritual uplift. **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Glass Construction Anchors (≥8 required):**

- **Lead Line Quality:** 2-4mm H-section came creating bold black outlines, following figure contours and architectural elements with confident directional flow
- **Glass Paint Application:** Vitreous paint mixed with iron oxide, applied in controlled washes for flesh tones and shading, fired at 1200°F for permanent fusion
- **Color Mixing Methods:** Layered transparent glasses, silver stain on white glass creating yellows and warm tones, flashed ruby glass with detailed etching
- **Surface Texture:** Authentic crown glass with natural variations, pontil marks preserved, surface irregularities creating light refraction
- **Edge Treatment:** Clean lead came joints, soldered intersections, weatherproofing with traditional putty compounds
- **Detail Hierarchy:** Primary figures 60% composition, secondary elements 25%, decorative borders 15%
- **Sacred Pose Anchors:** Head tilt 15-30° in contemplation, blessing gesture with raised right hand, contrapposto weight distribution 70/30
- **Proportional Measurements:** Figure height 6-8 heads, hands 120% natural scale, feet often obscured by drapery, halo diameter 18% of head height
- **Architectural Integration:** Window tracery coordination, structural iron armature invisible from interior, proper cathedral scale relationships
- **Material Authenticity:** No modern float glass, authentic medieval production methods, period-appropriate color chemistry
- **Light Transmission:** Calculated for cathedral interior illumination, color saturation optimized for backlighting
- **Sacred Iconography Precision:** Proper religious symbology, liturgical color conventions, theological accuracy in narrative details
