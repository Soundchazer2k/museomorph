## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via psychological penetration and confident gesture, never idealized flattery
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Alla prima wet-on-wet application supersedes visual appearance descriptions
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `alla-prima-direct` (direct painting with loaded brush, tonal modeling, nervous energy)
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` (confident asymmetry revealing character, power dynamics)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (recompose entirely for target ratio)
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to expose psychological undercurrents, social ambition, nervous energy of subjects
- **Material Physics Authority:** Heavy impasto application, wet-on-wet blending, brush-held-at-end technique
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1880-1920 studio methods, professional model studies, intensive preparation
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits
- **Material authenticity:** Authentic oil painting surface with period-appropriate canvas preparation and alla prima technique
- **Psychological Authority:** Expose ambition, decadence, nervous energy beneath aristocratic surfaces

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** (classical portrait) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Analyze the provided portrait(s). Redraw the subject entirely from scratch in John Singer Sargent's Gilded Age aristocratic portrait style (1880-1920).

- Preserve likeness through **psychological penetration** with emphasis on confident gesture and nervous energy beneath aristocratic surfaces
- **Timeframe:** Peak Gilded Age through Edwardian era (1880-1920)
- **Degree of likeness:** Psychologically revealing while maintaining dignity; emphasis on character exposure over flattery
- **Emotional tone:** Confident authority with underlying nervous energy, social ambition, aristocratic power dynamics
- **Pose conventions:** Asymmetrical confidence revealing personality; studied casualness masking intensive preparation
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original Gilded Age aristocratic attire avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `alla-prima-direct`
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Psychological insight and technical virtuosity overrides any source characterization
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery (aristocratic documentation with penetrating insight)

The final result must reveal the subject's inner character through confident brushwork and sophisticated color relationships.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (classical portrait format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely - extend sophisticated architectural or atmospheric backgrounds
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned with confident asymmetry emphasizing psychological presence and social status
- **Background Treatment:** Extend rich interior spaces, atmospheric effects, or architectural elements supporting figure prominence
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio serves Sargent's aristocratic tradition with optimal figure dignity and psychological revelation

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Carolus-Duran direct painting method, Velázquez tonal approach, Frans Hals brushwork confidence, cosmopolitan European training

**Medium/Production method:** Oil on canvas using alla prima (wet-on-wet) technique with heavily loaded brush held at extreme end like conductor's baton. Intensive preliminary studies using professional models. Middle-tone foundation building outward to highlights and accents. Physical painting process: constant movement between observation distance and close application, energetic "jabbing" brushstrokes.

**Thematic purpose:** Psychological portraiture of Gilded Age elite revealing character beneath aristocratic surfaces - exposing ambition, nervous energy, and social dynamics through technical virtuosity and penetrating observation.

**Hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**

- Confident asymmetrical poses (15-30 degree shoulder-hip differential revealing personality)
- Luxurious fabric rendering (silk with 45-degree highlight reflection, velvet light-absorption depth)
- Psychological gesture economy (meaningful hand positions, 2-3 decisive gestures maximum)
- Atmospheric background integration (soft focus supporting figure, 30-40% environmental context)
- Nervous energy brushwork (visible tool marks, 3-5mm impasto thickness, energetic application direction)

**Period framing:** Gilded Age America and Edwardian Britain (1880-1920), industrial wealth display, transatlantic aristocratic networks

**Tone Tag:** Psychological penetration, confident technique, aristocratic nervous energy, technical virtuosity

**Production Era Authenticity:** 1880-1920 studio standards with alla prima direct painting methods and intensive model preparation

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work:** Confident, energetic brushwork with brush held at extreme end creating spring-like fluidity. Visible tool marks subordinated to overall tonal harmony. Drawing achieved through direct paint application rather than preliminary outline.

**Anatomical Stylization:** Psychologically revealing proportions emphasizing character traits. Academic accuracy combined with interpretive enhancement of personality markers through gesture and expression.

**Detail Hierarchy:** Selective focus prioritizing psychological revelation - sharp detail on character-revealing features (eyes, hands, fabric textures), atmospheric treatment of supporting elements. Fabric specificity: silk (45-degree reflective highlights, fluid drape), velvet (light-absorbing depth, directional pile), satin (mirror-bright edges, crisp fold definition).

**Coloring Method:** Sophisticated tonal relationships built from middle values outward. Rich, harmonious palette supporting psychological insight. Flesh tones: naturalistic with subtle color temperature variations revealing mood and character.

**Texture Specifications:** Impasto thickness 3-5mm applied with loaded brush; Silk (reflective angles, flowing movement); Velvet (light absorption, rich depth); Flesh (subtle color temperature shifts, atmospheric modeling); Hair (directional stroke economy, selective detail concentration).

**Pose Anchors:** Head positioning: psychological engagement with 5-15 degree tilt revealing character; Shoulder-hip differential: 15-30 degree asymmetry showing confidence; Weight distribution: studied casualness masking preparation; Gesture economy: 2-3 meaningful hand positions maximum.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Proportions emphasizing psychological presence - slight enhancement of character-revealing features, atmospheric subordination of supporting elements.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic alla prima oil technique with period-appropriate canvas preparation and direct painting application.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All elements historically accurate to 1880-1920 aristocratic standards with documented studio methods.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 3:4 portrait format with psychological presence and aristocratic dignity.
