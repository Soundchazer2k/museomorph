## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `alla-prima-direct` (oil on canvas with fluid brushwork and elegant glazing)
- **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto` (elegant three-quarter pose with graceful positioning)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (recompose entirely for target ratio)
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately relaxed, informal elegance when historically accurate
- **Material Physics Authority:** Thin oil paint application, smooth long brushstrokes, silvery tonalities
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1630s English court workshop methods, aristocratic portraiture standards

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** (classical portrait) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Analyze the provided portrait(s). Redraw the subject entirely from scratch in Anthony van Dyck's Baroque court portrait style (1620s-1640s).

- Preserve likeness through **elegant idealization** with aristocratic refinement
- **Timeframe:** Peak court portrait period, especially English court years (1632-1641)
- **Degree of likeness:** Idealized but recognizable; emphasis on noble bearing and elegance
- **Emotional tone:** Aristocratic elegance, refined dignity, romantic nobility
- **Pose conventions:** Elegant three-quarter pose; graceful hand positioning; aristocratic bearing
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original aristocratic attire and accessories avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `alla-prima-direct`
- **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Aristocratic elegance overrides any source characterization
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery (aristocratic portraiture standard)

The final result must be an elegant painted celebration of aristocratic refinement and noble bearing.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (classical portrait format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely - extend elegant drapery or landscape elements
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned with aristocratic commanding presence, low viewpoint effect
- **Background Treatment:** Extend rich architectural settings, flowing drapery, or landscape vistas seamlessly
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio serves van Dyck's elegant court tradition with optimal figure dignity and graceful proportions

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Rubens' dynamic brushwork, Venetian colorito, Flemish attention to luxury materials, Titian's color mastery

**Medium/Production method:** Oil on canvas with fluid brushwork and elegant glazing. Paint application: thin texture enabling smooth, long brushstrokes. Silvery tonalities with bold experimental tints. Revolutionary loose brushwork creating movement and light.

**Thematic purpose:** Aristocratic portraiture emphasizing noble breeding, refined taste, and "careless romance" - the deliberate informality of absolute confidence.

**Hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**

- Flowing silk rendering (45-degree light reflection angles, movement captured in fabric folds)
- "Careless romance" costume (fantasy dress, flowing scarves, timeless elegance)
- Graceful hand positioning (elongated fingers, elegant gestures, aristocratic bearing)
- Silvery flesh tones (cool northern light adaptation, refined color harmony)
- Dynamic compositional devices (low viewpoint forcing upward gaze, slanted planes creating depth)

**Period framing:** Stuart court England (1630s-1640s), aristocratic revolution in portraiture, synthesis of Flemish technique with Italian color

**Tone Tag:** Aristocratic elegance, refined dignity, romantic nobility, effortless authority

**Production Era Authenticity:** Stuart court workshop standards, aristocratic patron expectations, efficient studio methodology with master's direct intervention on faces

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work:** Flowing, elegant brushwork with soft contours; emphasis on graceful form through atmospheric modeling. Tool marks: fluid paint application, sweeping strokes capturing movement, especially in fabric rendering. Edge treatment: soft transitions supporting aristocratic grace.

**Anatomical Stylization:** Idealized aristocratic proportions with elegant elongation; refined features emphasizing noble breeding. Head-to-body ratio: 1:8 for enhanced elegance. Hand proportions: elongated for aristocratic refinement.

**Detail Hierarchy:** Selective focus on luxurious materials - silk satins (reflective sheen, fluid drape), elaborate lace (intricate pattern work), rich velvets (light-absorbing depth), aristocratic jewelry (pearl luminosity, gold reflectivity).

**Coloring Method:** Revolutionary palette evolution - rich Italian warmth transitioning to characteristic silvery sheen, culminating in bold experimental tints for English court. "Van Dyck brown" signature pigment. Harmonious color relationships with sophisticated atmospheric effects.

**Texture Specifications:** Silk (fluid brushwork, 45-degree highlights), lace (delicate linear work), velvet (rich impasto), flesh (smooth transitions, silvery tonality). Paint thickness: thin application for smooth strokes, layered glazing for luminous depth.

**Pose Anchors:** Head tilt: 10-25 degrees for elegant asymmetry; shoulder angle: graceful three-quarter turn; weight distribution: aristocratic contrapposto; gesture economy: flowing movement, hands positioned for elegance.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Proportions idealized for aristocratic bearing - slight elongation (110% standard proportions), enhanced vertical emphasis.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic 17th-century oil painting surface with period-appropriate canvas weave and oil behavior.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All elements historically accurate to 1630s-1640s Stuart court standards.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 3:4 portrait format with aristocratic commanding presence.

**Format-Specific Rules:** Museum documentation standard emphasizes pure artistic refinement without textual distraction.

------

## Historical Context Integration

**Artistic Revolution:** Van Dyck's transformation of English portraiture from stiff formality to "relaxed elegance and understated authority." His invention of "careless romance" - the deliberate informality that projected absolute confidence and aristocratic breeding.

**Stuart Court Context:** Portraits served as sophisticated propaganda for increasingly embattled monarchy, projecting divine right through effortless elegance rather than rigid ceremony. Revolutionary approach to royal imagery emphasizing natural sovereignty.

**Technical Innovation:** Synthesis of Rubens' dramatic brushwork with Titian's coloristic subtlety, creating new visual language of aristocratic portraiture. Studio methodology balancing efficiency with direct master intervention for psychological penetration.

**Cultural Authority:** Established template for aristocratic portraiture dominating British art for 150+ years. Influenced fashion ("Van Dyck collar," "Van Dyck beard") and cultural conception of aristocratic elegance extending through Gainsborough and Reynolds.

**"Careless Romance" Definition:** Strategic artistic choice creating timeless elegance through fantasy dress, flowing elements, and deliberate informality - technical sophistication disguised as effortless grace, humanizing power through aristocratic confidence rather than rigid ceremony.
