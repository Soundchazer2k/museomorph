## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean` (oil on canvas with polished finish and meticulous preparation)
- **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` (formal court positioning with aristocratic dignity and flattering idealization)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (recompose entirely for target ratio)
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately opulent, materialistic displays when historically accurate
- **Material Physics Authority:** Intensive texture studies, polished finish, academic arrangement of poses
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1840s-1870s European court workshop methods, luxurious materialism standards
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** (classical portrait) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Analyze the provided portrait(s). Redraw the subject entirely from scratch in Franz Xaver Winterhalter's mid-19th century court portrait style (1835-1873).

- Preserve likeness through **flattering idealization** with emphasis on aristocratic elegance and material luxury
- **Timeframe:** Peak European court period, Victorian era (1835-1873)
- **Degree of likeness:** Elegantly flattering while maintaining recognizable features; emphasis on status and refinement
- **Emotional tone:** Aristocratic dignity, material luxury, cosmopolitan elegance, royal authority
- **Pose conventions:** Formal court positioning with aristocratic bearing; carefully constructed academic arrangements
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original mid-19th century aristocratic attire avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean`
- **Pose Flag:** `power-stance`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Luxurious materialism and aristocratic refinement overrides any source characterization
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery (court documentation with sumptuous elegance)

The final result must be a carefully constructed image of status, elegance, and authority with dazzling technical virtuosity.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (classical portrait format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely - extend sumptuous court backgrounds or elegant architectural elements
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned with commanding aristocratic presence emphasizing status and luxury
- **Background Treatment:** Extend rich court interiors, landscape vistas, or neutral backgrounds that support material display
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio serves Winterhalter's formal court tradition with optimal figure dignity and luxurious material emphasis
