## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `loose-brushstrokes` (oil on canvas with revolutionary atmospheric technique)
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` (ceremonial dignity with penetrating psychological presence)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (recompose entirely for target ratio)
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately uncomfortable psychological penetration when historically accurate
- **Material Physics Authority:** Variable brushwork density, atmospheric perspective, "manner abreviada" technique
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1640s-1650s Spanish court workshop methods, revolutionary loose brushwork

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** (classical portrait) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Analyze the provided portrait(s). Redraw the subject entirely from scratch in Diego Velázquez's Spanish court portrait style (1620s-1660s).

- Preserve likeness through **penetrating realism** combined with royal dignity
- **Timeframe:** Peak Spanish court period, mature style (1630s-1660s)
- **Degree of likeness:** Unflinching realism tempered by royal ceremony; psychological depth
- **Emotional tone:** Regal authority, psychological complexity, ceremonial grandeur
- **Pose conventions:** Formal court positioning; ceremonial dignity; psychological presence
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original Habsburg court attire and accessories avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `loose-brushstrokes`
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Psychological realism overrides any source idealization
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery (court documentation with psychological truth)

The final result must be a masterful exploration of character within royal ceremony.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (classical portrait format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely - extend atmospheric backgrounds or court settings
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned with psychological commanding presence, atmospheric depth
- **Background Treatment:** Extend neutral atmospheric backgrounds or court architectural elements seamlessly
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio serves Velázquez's revolutionary psychological portraiture with optimal atmospheric perspective

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Caravaggio's realism, Venetian colorito, Rubens' atmospheric technique, Italian Renaissance dignity combined with Spanish court ceremony

**Medium/Production method:** Oil on canvas with revolutionary brushwork and atmospheric perspective. Paint application: variable density - tight foreground brushstrokes transitioning to loose atmospheric background. "Manera abreviada" technique creating form through patches of hue rather than linear definition.

**Thematic purpose:** Royal portraiture balancing ceremony with psychological truth, serving Habsburg court while documenting human character with unprecedented honesty.

**Hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**

- Revolutionary loose brushstrokes (visible up close, resolving at viewing distance of 6-8 feet)
- Atmospheric perspective (progressive loosening of brushwork from foreground to background)
- Psychological penetration (direct gaze, character revelation through subtle expression)
- Chiaroscuro mastery (dramatic light-shadow contrasts, theatrical spotlighting effect)
- Naturalistic dignity (unflinching truth combined with ceremonial authority)

**Period framing:** Habsburg Spain (1620s-1660s), Golden Age court culture, artistic revolution in naturalism

**Tone Tag:** Psychological complexity, ceremonial grandeur, revolutionary naturalism, atmospheric truth

**Production Era Authenticity:** Spanish court workshop standards, revolutionary technique development, direct observation methods

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work:** Revolutionary loose brushwork with atmospheric edges; emphasis on light and air rather than linear definition. Brushstrokes visible at close range, resolving into startling realism at proper viewing distance (6-8 feet). No strict contours - forms defined by patches of hue and light-shadow contrast.

**Anatomical Stylization:** Naturalistic proportions with psychological penetration; unflinching documentation of individual character. Scientific accuracy without idealization beyond natural dignity. Measurement specifications: proportions based on direct observation, psychological expression through subtle facial modeling.

**Detail Hierarchy:** Variable density technique - tight, controlled brushstrokes in foreground (2-3mm precision), progressively looser toward background creating atmospheric perspective. Selective focus supporting psychological and ceremonial impact.

**Coloring Method:** Sophisticated atmospheric palette using Caravaggio-inspired chiaroscuro with Venetian influence. Earth tones, rich darks, dramatic light effects. Flesh tones: naturalistic without flattery. Background: neutral atmospheric grays and browns creating depth.

**Texture Specifications:** Fabric rendering through loose brushwork suggesting rather than depicting every detail; flesh (naturalistic modeling with visible brushwork); metal (reflective highlights with economical strokes); atmospheric backgrounds (increasingly abstract brushwork creating spatial depth).

**Pose Anchors:** Head positioning: psychologically revealing angles; shoulder placement: formal court dignity; weight distribution: ceremonial authority; gesture economy: minimal movement conveying maximum psychological presence.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** All proportions scientifically accurate based on direct observation - no idealization beyond natural dignity.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic 17th-century oil painting surface with period-appropriate canvas weave and revolutionary brushwork technique.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All elements historically accurate to 1630s-1660s Spanish court workshop standards with Velázquez's innovative methods.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 3:4 portrait format with atmospheric depth and psychological presence.

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Omit entirely

**Historical Accuracy:** Spanish court portraits of this period focused purely on psychological and ceremonial painted achievement without text integration. Velázquez's revolutionary approach emphasized the power of naturalistic observation over textual elements.

**Format-Specific Rules:** Museum documentation standard emphasizes pure artistic psychological achievement without textual distraction.

------

## Historical Context Integration

**Revolutionary Technique:** Velázquez's breakthrough innovation was the "manera abreviada" - loose brushwork that appears abstract up close but resolves into startling realism at proper viewing distance. This technique, centuries ahead of its time, directly influenced later Impressionism and modern painting.

**Spanish Court Context:** Portraits served complex dual function - maintaining Habsburg ceremonial dignity while documenting psychological truth with unprecedented honesty. Revolutionary approach to royal imagery emphasizing human character within ceremonial framework.

**Psychological Innovation:** Velázquez's unique genius was "walking along the edge of the precipice" - remaining close to realistic documentation while unlocking "the greatest and deepest things that man can feel." This psychological penetration combined with technical innovation created new paradigm for portraiture.

**Cultural Authority:** Established as "painter of painters" whose influence extended from contemporaries like Rembrandt through modern masters including Manet, Picasso, and Francis Bacon. His revolutionary technique and psychological insight continue to influence artists centuries later.

**Technical Legacy:** His loose brushwork technique was so advanced that forms are defined by patches of hue and light-shadow contrast rather than linear definition - a revolutionary approach that anticipated Impressionism by 200 years and continues to influence contemporary naturalistic painting.
