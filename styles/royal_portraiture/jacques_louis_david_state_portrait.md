## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** (classical portrait) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Analyze the provided portrait(s). Redraw the subject entirely from scratch in Jacques-Louis David's Neoclassical aristocratic portrait style (1775-1825).

- Preserve likeness through **classical idealization** with emphasis on moral authority and sculptural dignity
- **Timeframe:** French Neoclassical period spanning monarchy, revolution, and empire (1775-1825)
- **Degree of likeness:** Classically idealized while maintaining recognizable features; emphasis on moral exemplar over individual psychology
- **Emotional tone:** Austere dignity, rational composure, classical authority, Enlightenment virtue
- **Pose conventions:** Hieratic formality with rigid compositional control; calculated arrangement supporting moral message
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original classical period attire avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `linear-anatomical-destruction`
- **Pose Flag:** `hieratic-formal`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Classical moral authority and linear precision overrides any source characterization
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery (moral exemplar documentation with classical gravitas)

The final result must embody Enlightenment virtue through rigorous classical composition and austere dignity.
