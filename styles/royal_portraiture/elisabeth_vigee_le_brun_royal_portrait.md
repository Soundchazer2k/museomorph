## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `glazing-layers-buildup` (oil on wood panel with enamel-like glazing technique)
- **Pose Flag:** `graceful-fluid` (elegant positioning with natural informality and maternal warmth for feminine subjects; classical dignity with restrained elegance for masculine subjects)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (recompose entirely for target ratio)
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately intimate, maternal expressions when historically accurate
- **Material Physics Authority:** Rubens-inspired glazing technique, golden highlights, transparent shadows
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1780s-1800s European court workshop methods, flattering naturalism standards
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** (classical portrait) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Analyze the provided portrait(s). Redraw the subject entirely from scratch in Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun's elegant court portrait style (1770s-1800s).

- Preserve likeness through **graceful idealization** with emphasis on feminine elegance
- **Timeframe:** Peak Ancien Régime and émigré period (1778-1809)
- **Degree of likeness:** Elegantly flattering while maintaining recognizable features; emphasis on grace
- **Emotional tone:** Graceful elegance, refined sensibility, aristocratic charm (maternal warmth for feminine subjects; classical dignity for masculine subjects)
- **Pose conventions:** Graceful three-quarter poses for feminine subjects; classical dignified positioning for masculine subjects; elegant hand positioning appropriate to subject
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original late 18th-century aristocratic attire avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `glazing-layers-buildup`
- **Pose Flag:** `graceful-fluid`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Vigée Le Brun's gender-appropriate approach overrides any source characterization - maternal warmth and aristocratic refinement for feminine subjects; classical dignity and restrained elegance for masculine subjects
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery (aristocratic portraiture with revolutionary intimacy)

The final result must be an elegant celebration of aristocratic femininity and refined taste.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (classical portrait format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely - extend elegant backgrounds or natural settings
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned with graceful elegance, maternal intimacy when appropriate
- **Background Treatment:** Extend naturalistic landscapes, elegant architectural elements, or atmospheric backgrounds seamlessly
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio serves Vigée Le Brun's elegant court tradition with optimal graceful proportions and maternal intimacy

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Rubens' glazing technique and color mastery, Raphael's Madonna compositions, Rousseau's naturalism philosophy, Old Master study through husband's collection

**Medium/Production method:** Oil on wood panel with sophisticated glazing technique creating enamel-like quality. Paint application: building up pictorial surface with layers, colored glazes for flesh modeling. Golden highlights applied thickly, shadows strong but transparent.

**Thematic purpose:** Aristocratic portraiture emphasizing grace, refinement, and revolutionary maternal intimacy - modernizing formal court traditions with natural sensibility and authentic emotional connection.

**Hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**

- Revolutionary maternal warmth (intimate embraces, authentic smiles showing teeth - scandalous for period)
- Rubens-inspired glazing technique (3-4 transparent layers building luminous flesh tones)
- Natural hair styling (no powder, flowing natural textures inspired by Rousseau ideals)
- Elegant costume simplicity (muslin dresses, flowing fabrics, rejection of rigid court fashion)
- Golden highlight technique (thick paint application, always golden tonality as specified in her memoirs)

**Period framing:** Late Ancien Régime France (1770s-1800s), revolutionary maternal portraiture, international aristocratic exile networks

**Tone Tag:** Graceful elegance, maternal tenderness, aristocratic refinement, natural sensibility

**Production Era Authenticity:** French court workshop standards adapted for revolutionary intimacy, international European court expectations during exile period

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work:** Smooth, refined brushwork with elegant contours creating enamel-like surface quality. Brushstrokes building up pictorial surface through layering rather than visible individual marks. Emphasis on graceful form through sophisticated glazing technique.

**Anatomical Stylization:** Idealized feminine proportions with graceful elongation emphasizing aristocratic refinement. Measurement specifications: classical proportions adapted for elegant femininity, maternal poses showing authentic physical intimacy.

**Detail Hierarchy:** Rubens-inspired technique - colored glazes modeling subtle flesh tones, thick golden highlights, transparent shadows. Fabric rendering emphasizing texture variety: silk sheen, muslin simplicity, lace delicacy, natural hair flow.

**Coloring Method:** Sophisticated glazing palette derived from Rubens study - "strong but transparent shadows," thick golden highlights. Flesh tones: warm, luminous through multiple glaze layers. Background: naturalistic landscape colors or elegant architectural tones.

**Texture Specifications:** Flesh (enamel-like smoothness through glazing, 3-4 layer buildup); fabric (silk reflectivity, muslin simplicity, natural drape); hair (flowing natural texture, no powder effects); highlights (thick, golden application as specified).

**Pose Anchors:** Head positioning: graceful tilts showing maternal warmth or aristocratic elegance for feminine subjects; dignified classical positioning for masculine subjects; shoulder placement: natural informality breaking court rigidity for women, restrained elegance maintaining classical bearing for men; gesture economy: meaningful hand positions showing relationship dynamics or intellectual refinement as appropriate to subject gender.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Proportions idealized for aristocratic femininity while maintaining authentic maternal intimacy when appropriate.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic 18th-century oil painting surface with wood panel preparation and period-appropriate glazing technique.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All elements historically accurate to 1770s-1800s French and European court standards with revolutionary intimacy innovations.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 3:4 portrait format with elegant grace and maternal warmth when appropriate.

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Omit entirely

**Historical Accuracy:** Late 18th-century aristocratic portraits focused purely on elegant painted achievement and revolutionary maternal intimacy without text integration. Vigée Le Brun's innovations emphasized natural beauty and authentic emotional connection over textual elements.

**Format-Specific Rules:** Museum documentation standard emphasizes pure artistic elegance and maternal revolution without textual distraction.

------

## Historical Context Integration

**Revolutionary Maternal Innovation:** Vigée Le Brun's transformation of aristocratic portraiture through authentic maternal intimacy - first artist to show teeth in smile (scandalous 1787), revolutionary natural hair styling, authentic physical embraces with children inspired by personal motherhood experience.

**Ancien Régime Context:** Portraits served dual function - maintaining aristocratic elegance while introducing revolutionary natural sensibility influenced by Rousseau's philosophy. Her "chemise dress" scandal (1783) represented clash between rigid court formality and emerging natural ideals.

**Technical Innovation:** Rubens-inspired glazing technique creating "enamel-like quality" through sophisticated layering. Her documented advice: "strong but transparent shadows," "thick golden highlights," building up pictorial surface through colored glazes rather than direct painting.

**International Success:** Twelve-year exile (1789-1801) demonstrated universal appeal of her elegant style across European courts - successful adaptations for Italian, Austrian, and Russian aristocracy while maintaining signature maternal warmth and technical excellence.

**Cultural Authority:** Established new paradigm for feminine portraiture combining aristocratic refinement with authentic emotional connection. Her revolutionary approaches (natural hair, simple muslin, maternal intimacy) influenced entire generation of portrait painters and redefined acceptable feminine representation in art.
