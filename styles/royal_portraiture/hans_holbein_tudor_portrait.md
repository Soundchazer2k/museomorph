## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean` (oil on oak panel with precise glazing techniques)
- **Pose Flag:** `frontal-rigid` or `contrapposto` (formal court positioning with ceremonial dignity)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (recompose entirely for target ratio)
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately uncomfortable psychological penetration when historically accurate
- **Material Physics Authority:** Oil paint thickness 2-3mm, oak panel preparation, chalk ground, invisible brushwork
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1530s court workshop methods, guild-trained precision, diplomatic documentation requirements

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** (classical portrait) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Analyze the provided portrait(s). Redraw the subject entirely from scratch in Hans Holbein the Younger's Northern Renaissance court portrait style (1520s-1540s).

- Preserve likeness through **meticulous realism** and precise character documentation
- **Timeframe:** Tudor court period, peak years (1526-1543)
- **Degree of likeness:** Extremely faithful documentation; unflinching realism with symbolic dignity
- **Emotional tone:** Authoritative, dignified, psychologically penetrating, ceremonially formal
- **Pose conventions:** Frontal or three-quarter view; hands positioned to display rings; formal court stance
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original Tudor court attire and accessories avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean`
- **Pose Flag:** `frontal-rigid`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Northern European precision overrides any source stylization
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery (museum documentation standard)

The final result must be a masterful painted document combining Northern European precision with royal gravitas.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (classical portrait format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely - extend background architectural elements
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned upper-third, hands in lower-third for symbolic display
- **Background Treatment:** Extend rich damask hangings or neutral architectural space seamlessly
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio serves Holbein's formal court documentation tradition with optimal figure-to-background proportion

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Flemish primitive precision, Italian Renaissance dignity, German attention to material detail, court propaganda requirements

**Medium/Production method:** Oil on oak panel with precise glazing techniques. Canvas preparation: chalk ground, multiple thin oil layers, invisible brushwork building luminous surface depth. Paint thickness 2-3mm with scientific color accuracy.

**Thematic purpose:** Official royal documentation and dynastic propaganda serving Tudor court political needs during Protestant Reformation crisis.

**Hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**

- Meticulous textile rendering (every thread and pattern documented)
- Jewelry precision (gemstone reflections, metalwork detail, chain link accuracy)
- Psychological penetration (direct gaze, subtle character revelation)
- Symbolic object placement (rings, pendants, books positioned for meaning)
- Architectural dignity (column capitals, wall hangings, spatial gravitas)

**Period framing:** English Reformation court (1530s-1540s), diplomatic crisis, religious schism, royal marriage politics

**Tone Tag:** Documentary authority, ceremonial dignity, psychological truth, political propaganda

**Production Era Authenticity:** Guild workshop standards, Northern European oil techniques, court painter protocols, diplomatic documentation precision

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work:** Invisible brushwork with scientific precision; sharp contours defining form through light modeling; emphasis on material truth over linear expression. Tool marks: fine sable brushes, methodical glazing strokes, edge precision 0.5mm tolerance.

**Anatomical Stylization:** Naturalistic proportions with unflinching accuracy; precise physiognomy documenting individual character; no idealization beyond natural dignity. Measurement specifications: head-to-body ratio 1:7.5, hand proportions scientifically accurate.

**Detail Hierarchy:** Extreme attention to surface materials - fur texture (individual hair rendering), silk sheen (light reflection angles), velvet nap (pile direction), metal reflectivity (environmental mapping), skin texture (pore-level precision).

**Coloring Method:** Rich, deep palette using period pigments; jewel tones (ultramarine, vermillion, gold leaf); precise color matching; symbolic color deployment. Glazing technique: 3-5 transparent layers building luminous depth.

**Texture Specifications:** Fur (1mm individual hair strokes), silk (45-degree highlight angles), velvet (perpendicular pile rendering), metal (mirror-sharp reflections), skin (subtle sfumato transitions). Surface depth: 2-3mm paint thickness with authentic oil behavior.

**Pose Anchors:** Head tilt: 0-15 degrees maximum; shoulder angle: square to picture plane or 15-degree turn; weight distribution: formal balance; gesture economy: minimal movement, hands positioned for ring display.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** All proportions scientifically accurate unless ceremonially enhanced (shoulders broadened 10% maximum for authority).

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic 16th-century oil painting surface with period-appropriate cracking patterns and oil sink-in characteristics.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All elements historically accurate to 1530s-1540s court workshop standards.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 3:4 portrait format with formal court positioning.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (3:4 Portrait):**

- **Vertical Emphasis:** Subject dominance ≥75% of canvas height
- **Hierarchical Staging:** Face in upper third, hands in lower third for symbolic display
- **Format Considerations:** Classical portrait proportions supporting formal court dignity

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective Regime:** Single-point perspective with architectural framing elements; Northern European spatial accuracy
- **Grid/Symmetry:** Formal bilateral balance with slight asymmetry for psychological interest
- **Figure:Ground Ratio:** 70% figure dominance, 30% environmental context
- **Density Percentage:** High detail concentration optimized for close viewing (2-3 feet distance)
- **Lighting Logic:** Single-source illumination (window left) creating form-revealing shadows; Renaissance chiaroscuro adapted to Northern precision
- **Detail:Negative Space Ratio:** Maximum detail density supporting documentary function

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Oak panel with chalk ground preparation, studio wall mounting
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely - pure painted achievement without decorative framing
- **Production Context Anchor:** Tudor court workshop with diplomatic documentation standards
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for 3:4 classical portrait format

**Environmental Integration:** Rich damask wall hangings, architectural elements (columns, pilasters), or neutral backgrounds supporting figure prominence without competition.

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Omit entirely

**Historical Accuracy:** Court portraits of this period focused purely on painted achievement without text integration. Any inscription would have been added separately to frame or cartouche, not integrated into painted surface.

**Format-Specific Rules:** Museum documentation standard emphasizes pure artistic achievement without textual distraction.

------

## Historical Context Integration

**Protestant Reformation Impact:** Holbein's career pivot from religious art to court portraiture due to iconoclastic destruction of traditional commissions. This crisis forced adaptation to secular patronage, resulting in revolutionary psychological portraiture serving political propaganda needs.

**Court Politics:** Portraits functioned as diplomatic tools during Henry VIII's break with Rome, marriage negotiations, and dynastic propaganda. Each portrait carried political weight requiring absolute accuracy and symbolic sophistication.

**Technical Innovation:** Holbein's synthesis of Flemish precision, Italian dignity, and German material truth created new standard for court portraiture that defined the genre for centuries.

**Cultural Authority:** Works served as definitive visual documents of Tudor court, with Holbein functioning as "the cameraman of Tudor history" whose images became the permanent record of this pivotal historical moment.
