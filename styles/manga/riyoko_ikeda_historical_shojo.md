## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** (tankōbon manga format) - ignore source image dimensions completely
- Redraw in **Riyoko Ikeda 1970s Year 24 Group Shoujo Manga Style** for **clean manga illustration**
- Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression using Ikeda's romantic idealized character design principles
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original character designs avoiding copyrighted Rose of Versailles elements while maintaining authentic Year 24 Group aesthetic
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `ikeda-screentone-application`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `gestural-romantic-dramatic`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Ikeda's emotional expressiveness and 1970s shoujo technical methods supersede source image characteristics
- **Mode Selector:** Clean manga illustration (no text elements)

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- `3:4` (tankōbon manga format, optimized for 1970s shoujo publication standards)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Strict recomposition for 3:4 vertical shoujo format
- **Spatial Allocation:** Character dominance ≥60%, following Ikeda's emotion-driven composition principles
- **Background Treatment:** Dual-mode approach - ornate historical detail OR abstract symbolic patterns (flowers, sparkles, gradients)
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio serves emotional storytelling with collage-like overlapping panel aesthetics

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Year 24 Group revolutionary shoujo movement, second-wave feminism, Japanese student activism, European literature and cinema, 18th century French historical context
- **Medium/Production method:** Full color illustration using traditional media techniques, authentic 1970s color application methods, detailed color work maintaining shoujo aesthetic principles
- **Thematic purpose:** Psychological interiority exploration, complex historical drama, romantic idealization with emotional depth
- **3-5 hallmark motifs:**
  1. Large liquid eyes with "gleam and glitter" - intricate light reflections dominating facial composition (40-50% of face height)
  2. Emotion-driven collage-like panel compositions rejecting rigid cinematic grids
  3. Backgrounds dissolving into abstract symbolic patterns during emotional peaks (flowers, sparkles, atmospheric gradients)
  4. Elaborate historical costumes with ornate decorative details
  5. Androgynous character design capability blurring traditional gender markers
- **Period framing:** 1972-1973 Rose of Versailles serialization era, pre-digital manga production golden age
- **Tone Tag:** Heightened emotionalism with romantic dramatic intensity
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Offset lithography printing with visible screentone application artifacts and characteristic paper aging

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line Quality:** Variable weight ink lines ranging from delicate fine details (0.3mm) to bold emphatic outlines (2mm), nervous animated quality with visible paper texture interaction
- **Eye Construction - Universal Foundation:** Large expressive eyes serving as primary emotional vehicle with Ikeda's distinctive shoujo proportions
- **Eye Construction - Female Characters:** Almond shape with dramatic high-arc upper lid, dominating facial composition at 40-50% of face height. Iris extremely large taking up almost entire exposed eyeball area with deep dark color and high gloss reflectivity. Primary highlight: large bright white circular highlight dominating center-top of pupil/iris. Secondary highlights: multiple smaller star-shaped multi-point highlights clustered and radiating near center creating sparkling glittering effect. Upper eyelashes: thick long heavily clustered in distinct groups radiating outward with dramatic volume and curl, thick dark eyelid line. Lower eyelashes: shorter sparsely distributed as small precise spikes. Single clean high supratarsal fold following large arc of upper lid.
- **Eye Construction - Male Characters:** Large eyes by shoujo standards but smaller than female proportions, more angular eye shape with controlled emotional expression, simpler highlight patterns, less elaborate lash construction while maintaining shoujo delicacy
- **Body Proportions - Female Characters:** Elongated slender graceful figures, narrow shoulders with pronounced waist definition, romantic flowing movement
- **Body Proportions - Male Characters:** Broader shoulders with more geometric body structure, military bearing and posture, structured masculine silhouettes
- **Androgynous Design Capability:** Lady Oscar archetype combining feminine facial features with masculine clothing and styling, intentional gender marker blurring
- **Screentone Application:** Manual 1970s preprinted adhesive sheets applied with stylus rubbing and burnishing tools, visible cut edges and slight misalignments, mechanical dot patterns for atmospheric effects
- **Historical Costume Detail:** Elaborate 18th century French court dress with ornate decorative elements for females, military uniforms with structured geometric cuts for males
- **Paper Surface Authenticity:** Senka paper texture (thin colored newsprint) or standard book paper with characteristic yellowing and ink absorption patterns

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

- **Wardrobe tracks:** 18th century French historical accuracy with court and military dress codes

- **Female Clothing Philosophy:** Elaborate period costumes with ornate decorative details, flowing fabrics revealing silhouette, intricate rococo ornamentation, court dress with panniers and elaborate sleeves

- **Male Clothing Philosophy:** Military uniforms with structured geometric cuts, minimal ornamentation, emphasis on rank and function, double-breasted coats with gold trim and epaulettes

- **Androgynous Clothing:** Military-style uniforms on feminine figures, gender-blurring formal wear combining masculine tailoring with feminine proportions

- **Fabric behavior:** Period-accurate heavy brocades, silks, and military wool with appropriate drape and structure

- **Accessory caps:** Female 3-5 decorative elements (jewelry, ribbons, hair ornaments, fans); Male 1-2 functional military elements (swords, insignia)

- **Color palette:** Authentic 1970s screentone limitations creating high-contrast black and white with selective color accents

- **Historical accuracy:** Documented 18th century French fashion with attention to class distinctions and period-appropriate construction

- **Props:** Maximum 1 hero prop supporting historical narrative (swords, fans, letters, roses)

- **Coherence filter:** All elements support Rose of Versailles historical context; fallback = character emotional focus

- **YAML prop pools:**

  ```yaml
  court_props:  - ornate_fans  - jewelry_accessories  - letter_correspondence  - rose_bouquetsmilitary_props:  - ceremonial_swords  - military_insignia  - formal_gloves  - rank_indicators
  ```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

- **Canvas Negatives (≥2):**
  - "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "rigid cinematic panel grids"
  - "digital photo filters", "modern offset printing", "photorealistic backgrounds"
  - "emotionally restrained expressions", "uniform line weight", "modern manga conventions"
  - "conventional gender roles", "simple character designs", "minimal historical detail"
- **Canvas Positives (≥2):**
  - "exactly 3:4 tankōbon manga ratio", "full color illustration with traditional media authenticity"
  - "large liquid eyes with crystalline gleam and glitter reflections 40-50% face height", "emotion-driven collage compositions"
  - "female characters: elaborate historical costumes, maximum eye expressiveness with liquid emotional depth, narrow shoulders, romantic idealization"
  - "male characters: military uniforms, broader shoulders, angular jaw definition, controlled emotional expression with shoujo delicacy"
  - "overlapping borderless panels", "backgrounds dissolving into symbolic patterns during emotional peaks"
  - "authentic Ikeda facial proportions and liquid eye quality", "romantic dramatic emotional intensity"
- **Vocabulary warnings:** Avoid "realistic," "cinematic," "modern," "digital." Prioritize "romantic," "emotional," "theatrical," "idealized," "historical"

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

- **For 3:4 Portrait:** Vertical emphasis accommodating emotion-driven layouts, character dominance ≥60%

**IKEDA-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Panel Structure:** Emotion-driven collage-like compositions explicitly rejecting rigid cinematic grids, overlapping borderless panels with permeable boundaries
- **Perspective regime:** Subjective psychological framing prioritizing emotional impact over objective spatial reality
- **Figure:ground %:** 60% character focus minimum, backgrounds dissolve completely during emotional intensity peaks
- **Density %:** High intricate detail in character costumes and facial features, simplified or abstracted backgrounds for emotional focus
- **Lighting logic:** Dramatic romantic lighting supporting heightened emotional atmosphere, screentone gradients for tonal effects
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** Strategic negative space allowing elaborate costume details to dominate visual hierarchy

**BACKGROUND TREATMENT:**

- **Dual Mode Approach:** Ornate historical settings establishing 18th century French context OR abstract symbolic "emotion-scapes" (decorative floral patterns, cascading sparkles, atmospheric gradients)
- **Emotional Externalization:** Physical backgrounds abandoned during peak emotional moments, replaced by symbolic patterns representing character interior states
- **Surface Context:** Senka paper (magazine serialization) or aged book paper (tankōbon collection) with characteristic texture and yellowing

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Offset lithography on period-appropriate paper with visible texture and aging characteristics
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit rigid panel structures - focus on fluid emotional boundaries
- **Production Context Anchor:** 1972-1973 pre-digital manga production constraints with manual screentone application
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Strict 3:4 vertical composition optimized for shoujo emotional storytelling

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

- **Binary:** **OMIT** all text elements
- **Clean Art Focus:** Pure illustration without dialogue, sound effects, or publication elements
- **Character-Centric:** Composition designed for emotional expression through large expressive eyes and romantic dramatic poses
- **Visual Narrative:** Meaning conveyed through Ikeda's psychological interiority approach and symbolic background elements
- **Format-Specific Text Rules:** N/A - text completely omitted for clean manga art piece
- **Production Method Integration:** N/A - focusing on illustration elements only

------

## Ikeda-Specific Validation Anchors

- **Eye Dominance Test:** Eyes must dominate facial composition at 40-50% face height with intricate "gleam and glitter" reflections
- **Sexual Dimorphism Verification:** Subtle but clear distinction between female romantic idealization and male angular definition while maintaining shoujo delicacy
- **Screentone Authenticity:** Manual 1970s application artifacts with visible cut edges and mechanical dot patterns
- **Emotional Expression Check:** Heightened dramatic expressions avoiding stoic or restrained characterization
- **Historical Accuracy:** Period-appropriate 18th century French costumes and settings with documented details
- **Composition Flow:** Emotion-driven collage layouts rejecting rigid cinematic panel grids
- **Background Dissolution:** Symbolic pattern replacement during emotional intensity peaks
- **Production Authenticity:** All elements reflect 1970s pre-digital manga production with offset lithography characteristics
- **Androgynous Capability:** Framework can generate Lady Oscar-type characters blurring traditional gender markers
- **Material Surface Accuracy:** Senka paper texture or aged book paper characteristics affecting final image quality

------

This framework enforces authentic Riyoko Ikeda technical execution including the Year 24 Group's revolutionary shoujo innovations, distinctive sexual dimorphism patterns, and 1970s production authenticity while maintaining the Universal Prompt's systematic approach to canvas control and measurable artistic specifications.
