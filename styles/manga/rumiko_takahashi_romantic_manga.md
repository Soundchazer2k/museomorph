# Rumiko Takahashi Manga

**Version:** 4.2
 **Specificity:** Shōnen/Romantic Comedy Manga (1978-1990s Production Era)
 **Visual Evidence Base:** 12 reference images analyzed
 **Purpose:** Authentic replication of Takahashi's signature romantic-comedy manga aesthetic with period-accurate production methods

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source dimensions; compose for manga cover format (2:3 or 4:5 ratio)
- **Style over likeness:** Apply Takahashi's techniques to preserve model identity via silhouette/gesture/expression
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("15-20% eye height", "120-150% hair volume") override descriptive language ("large eyes", "voluminous hair")
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** Takahashi-specific flags permitted when standard options fail authenticity requirements
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately exaggerated or comedic aesthetics when historically accurate
- **Evidence-Based Precedence:** All specifications derived from visual analysis of authentic Takahashi covers and pages
- **Production Era Lock:** 1978-1990s manga techniques - minimal screentone, clean line emphasis, romantic color palettes
- **Takahashi-Specific Flags:**
  - *Face Treatment:* `large-eyes-mandatory`, `soft-curved-features`, `expressive-eyebrows`, `romantic-proportions`, `gentle-line-quality`
  - *Style Context:* `takahashi-aesthetic`, `watercolor-technique`, `clean-line-emphasis`, `emotional-expression-priority`
  - *Color Approach:* `watercolor-technique-primary`, `paper-texture-visible`, `organic-bleeding-edges`, `atmospheric-wash-backgrounds`, `color-saturation-variation`
  - *Production Method:* `minimal-screentone`, `clean-areas`, `motion-lines`, `authentic-1980s-methods`
  - *Pose Anchors:* `dynamic-gestures`, `energetic-movement`, `expressive-positioning`
- **Canvas Control Flags:** `strict-reframe` (mandatory for manga format)
- **Material Physics Authority:** Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Viewing distance requirements affect detail hierarchy and emotional impact
- **Cultural Production Authenticity:** Japanese shōnen manga methods take precedence over modern interpretations
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; original character design avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented (female prominence is thematic tendency, not override)
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic watercolor-on-paper characteristics with visible texture and organic bleeding
- **Period Production Authenticity:** For 1980s manga style, use period-appropriate watercolor techniques with natural paper texture - avoid modern digital gradient perfection and flat color fills
- **Watercolor Authority:** Traditional watercolor bleeding and paper texture supersedes digital smoothness; authentic hand-painted characteristics required
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid genre drift defaults (moe autopilot, digital painting smoothing, etc.)
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail
