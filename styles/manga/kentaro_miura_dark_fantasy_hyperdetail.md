# Kentaro Miura Manga

**Version:** 1.0
 **Purpose:** Evidence-based framework for replicating Kentaro Miura's meticulous dark fantasy illustration style, with distinct approaches for color and black & white execution.

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via hyperdetailed anatomical accuracy and Gothic atmospheric mood.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("200-500 armor detail elements", "50-100 crosshatch lines per square inch") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Meticulous detail construction supersedes speed or simplification.
- **Detail Density Mandate:** **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: 200-500+ individual detail elements per character minimum** - every rivet, buckle, scratch, dent, and surface texture must be individually rendered
- **Hyperdetail Investment:** **"Every surface textured" philosophy mandatory** - no smooth or simplified areas permitted on armor, weapons, or environmental elements.
- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**
  - *Color Mode:* `watercolor-texture-simulation`, `rough-organic-edges`, `muted-desaturated-palette`, `ink-line-preservation`, `sketchy-application-texture`
  - *Black & White Mode:* `crosshatch-dominance`, `screentone-strategic`, `white-ink-highlights`, `maximum-contrast`, `line-weight-variation`
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `romantic-sublime`, `heroic-low-angle`, `battle-weary`, `gothic-dramatic`, `architectural-scale-dwarfing`
- **Canvas Control Flags (choose one):** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`
- **Gothic Sublime Authority:** Compositions must evoke awe, terror, and overwhelming scale.
- **Architectural Realism Mandate:** All environments based on specific European medieval architectural references.
- **Armor Authenticity:** Anatomically accurate plating that follows human form with individual component rendering.
- **Text policy:** Omit all text for single illustration focus.
- **Safety/IP:** No graphic violence visualization; focus on atmospheric darkness and character presence.

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- **MODE SELECTOR:** Choose between **Color Mode** or **Black & White Mode** - never mix approaches.
- Redraw in **Kentaro Miura Dark Fantasy Hyperrealism** style for **single illustration composition**.
- Identity via hyperdetailed anatomical accuracy and atmospheric Gothic mood.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original dark fantasy character designs avoiding copyrighted elements.
- **Color Mode Declaration:** `airbrush-gradation` with `atmospheric-perspective`
- **B&W Mode Declaration:** `crosshatch-dominance` with `maximum-contrast`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `romantic-sublime`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Miura's meticulous detail philosophy dominates over speed or simplification.
- **Format:** Single illustration (no panels, speech bubbles, or manga formatting).

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- `2:3` (portrait orientation for character focus)
- `3:2` (landscape for environmental grandeur)
- `1:1` (square for balanced character/environment composition)
- `4:5` (tall portrait for dramatic vertical emphasis)
- `5:4` (wide landscape for epic scale scenes)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely for Gothic sublime composition principles
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure placement for maximum dramatic impact using romantic painting principles
- **Background Treatment:** Architectural detail maintained at 80-90% of foreground detail density
- **Format Justification:** Chosen ratio serves Gothic sublime aesthetic and environmental storytelling needs

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Gustave Doré (dramatic lighting/etching detail), Hieronymus Bosch (grotesque fantasy), M.C. Escher (impossible architecture), John Martin (Pandemonium sublime), Frank Frazetta (heroic fantasy dynamics), European Romanticism movement, Gothic architectural tradition
- **Medium/Production method:**
  - **Color Mode:** Digital airbrush simulation over precise ink foundation, watercolor texture emulation
  - **B&W Mode:** G-pen ink work with extensive crosshatching, strategic screentone application, white ink highlight details
- **Thematic purpose:** Gothic sublime evocation, "lies that seem possible," medieval European fantasy realism, psychological terror through environmental scale
- **Hallmark motifs:** Berserker Armor anatomical accuracy, Dragonslayer sword raw brutality, European architectural fusion (Gothic/Romanesque/Baroque), grotesque creature anatomical logic, romantic sublime scale relationships
- **Period framing:** Medieval European synthesis (early feudalism + Renaissance courtly life), post-1989 manga production authenticity
- **Tone Tag:** Dark sublime with meticulous craft devotion
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Traditional ink craft methods (pre-2015) or digital tool precision (post-2015) maintaining established aesthetic

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**COLOR MODE SPECIFICATIONS:**

- **Texture Simulation Priority:** Watercolor paper texture overlay mandatory, colored pencil stroke emulation, rough organic edges (never smooth digital gradients)
- **Saturation Limits:** Maximum 60-70% color saturation, muted earth tone dominance (browns, rusts, deep greens, grayed blues)
- **Ink Line Preservation:** 100% opacity black ink foundation always visible beneath color layers, color as enhancement only
- **Rough Application Technique:** Irregular color boundaries, sketchy application simulation, visible brush stroke texture, organic blending zones
- **Atmospheric Color Logic:** Color temperature shifts for depth, warm foreground/cool background separation, mood-driven color choices over realistic representation
- **Paper Texture Integration:** Visible tooth/grain texture throughout color areas, watercolor absorption simulation, uneven color density variations
- **Detail Hierarchy:** 200-500 individual elements per armored character maintained through color work, environmental detail at 80-90% of foreground

**BLACK & WHITE MODE SPECIFICATIONS:**

- **Crosshatch Density:** 50-100 parallel lines per square inch in shadow areas, directional consistency within form planes
- **Line Weight Variation:** 0.3mm base lines to 2mm accent strokes, G-pen pressure sensitivity emulation
- **Screentone Application:** Strategic 10-60% dot patterns for mid-tone gradation, texture patterns for material differentiation
- **White Ink Highlights:** Detailed pickup work in dense black areas, individual rivet/buckle/surface detail enhancement
- **Contrast Exploitation:** Full value range utilization from pure white to solid black, no middle-grey dominance
- **Surface Texture Differentiation:** Metal (crosshatch patterns), cloth (diagonal weaves), leather (organic irregular marks), stone (stippling/broken lines)

**UNIVERSAL SPECIFICATIONS:**

- **Anatomical Accuracy:** Hyperdetailed muscle definition, individual scar pattern documentation, stress line integration
- **Armor Construction:** Anatomically correct plating following human form, individual rivet/joint rendering, damage pattern specificity
- **Architectural Detail:** European medieval accuracy with specific period references, individual stone/brick rendering, structural logic maintenance
- **Perspective Mastery:** Complex vanishing point constructions for environmental depth, foreshortening excellence on weapons/objects
- **Environmental Scale:** Romantic sublime principles - vast landscapes/architecture dwarfing human figures for psychological impact

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Character Archetypes:**

- **Guts Type (Battle-Worn Warrior):** Layered practical armor over cloth, extensive battle damage, functional weapon integration
- **Griffith Type (Noble Knight):** Ornate ceremonial armor with decorative elements, pristine condition with luxury material indicators
