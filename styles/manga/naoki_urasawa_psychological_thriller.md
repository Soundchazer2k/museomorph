- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`.
- **Urasawa Construction Dominance:** Individual character building methodology with gender-appropriate specifications supersedes conventional manga aesthetics.
- **Mode Selector:** Single character illustration with cinematic psychological composition.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- `2:3` (portrait orientation for character focus - preferred for psychological intimacy)
- `4:5` (tall portrait for dramatic character emphasis)
- `3:2` (landscape for environmental storytelling)
- `1:1` (square for balanced character/environment composition)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely for Urasawa's cinematic composition principles
- **Spatial Allocation:** Character placement optimizing psychological impact and individual recognition, 60-70% figure dominance
- **Background Treatment:** Contemporary urban environmental support appropriate to 1990s-2000s settings with architectural accuracy
- **Format Justification:** Portrait ratio serves character-focused illustration with psychological depth and cinematic intimacy

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

  2. **Male construction: equal thin lines upper/lower, 2mm maximum pupil diameter**
  3. **Female construction: 1.5mm upper lid line, 0.3mm lower lid line, oval 3mm pupil**
  4. **Facial asymmetries: 15-20% deviation from perfect symmetry**
  5. **Weathered texture markers: 5-10 individual aging lines per character appropriate to apparent age**
- **Period framing:** 1990s-2000s seinen manga production era, contemporary urban settings with period-accurate details
- **Tone Tag:** Psychological character realism with individual specificity and contemplative complexity
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Traditional manga manuscript methods with G-pen line work, screentone dot patterns, manual production characteristics, avoiding modern digital smoothness

**VOCABULARY WARNINGS:** Avoid "anime," "manga-style," "cute," "idealized," "smooth," "perfect," "generic," "filter-like," "pleasant," "happy." Emphasize "individual," "distinctive," "weathered," "asymmetrical," "character-specific," "ethnically-authentic," "psychologically-complex," "gender-appropriate," "contemplative."

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Portrait Ratios (2:3, 4:5):** Character-focused composition with psychological intimacy, figure dominance 60-70%, environmental support enhancing individual recognition
- **Landscape Ratios (3:2):** Environmental storytelling with character integration, cinematic establishing shot principles
- **Square (1:1):** Balanced character/environment interaction with equal narrative weight

**URASAWA COMPOSITION PRINCIPLES:**

- **Cinematic Logic:** Film storyboard composition with clear shot type intention (close-up character focus, mid-shot environmental integration)
- **Psychological Staging:** Character placement supporting emotional narrative and contemplative psychological states
- **Environmental Authenticity:** Modern urban settings with 1990s-2000s architectural accuracy and period details
- **Atmospheric Integration:** Background elements enhancing character mood without competing for attention, 30-40% detail density relative to character

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Traditional manga manuscript paper simulation with smooth, non-textured background allowing clean ink application
- **Environmental Support Anchor:** Contemporary urban backgrounds (office buildings, cityscapes, interior spaces) appropriate to period and psychological thriller context
- **Cinematic Framing Anchor:** Film-influenced composition logic with clear narrative intention and character psychological focus
- **Individual Recognition Anchor:** Composition optimizing character distinctiveness and contemplative psychological expression

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

- **Binary Policy:** Omit all text entirely for pure character illustration focus
- **Text Prohibition:** No panels, speech bubbles, sound effects, chapter titles, or manga formatting elements
- **Justification:** Single character illustration format prioritizes visual character construction and psychological expression over textual narrative elements
- **Format Specification:** Clean illustration without manga publishing elements, suitable for character study and psychological analysis
- **Production Context:** Museum-quality character illustration without commercial manga formatting distractions

## Evidence-Based Validation Requirements

**MANDATORY AUTHENTICITY CHECKS:**

- ✅ Eye proportions: Maximum 8% of face width with gender-specific construction
- ✅ Male eyes: 1.2mm upper/lower lines, 2mm maximum pupil
- ✅ Female eyes: 1.5mm upper line, 0.3mm lower line, 3mm oval pupil
- ✅ Facial asymmetries: 10-20% deviation from perfect symmetry
- ✅ Weathered texture: 5-10 aging lines appropriate to character
- ✅ G-pen line quality: Organic texture with 0.1-0.3mm variation
- ✅ Screentone application: 40-60 LPI with visible dot patterns
- ✅ Individual specificity: Unique ethnic characteristics and bone structure
- ✅ Contemporary authenticity: 1990s-2000s urban professional context
- ✅ Production era consistency: Traditional manga methods only

**ANTI-PATTERN VERIFICATION:**

- ❌ No eyes exceeding 8% face width (contradicts 100% evidence of small eye proportions)
- ❌ No pleasant expressions (contradicts psychological complexity evidence)
- ❌ No smooth digital rendering (contradicts G-pen texture evidence)
- ❌ No same-face syndrome (contradicts individual construction evidence)
- ❌ No gender-inappropriate construction (contradicts documented male/female differences)
- ❌ No modern digital effects (contradicts 1994-2009 production evidence)

**TECHNICAL PRECISION ANCHORS:**

- Eye measurements: Maximum 8% face width, gender-specific construction ratios
- Line weights: 1.2mm major contours, 0.5mm details, 0.3mm texture work
- Asymmetry measurements: 10-20% facial deviation, 2-5 degree angle variations
- Screentone specifications: 40-60 LPI, 20-80% density ranges
- Weathering quantification: 5-10 individual aging lines per character

This framework ensures authentic Naoki Urasawa character construction based on comprehensive visual evidence analysis with quantified specifications preventing generic manga aesthetics while maintaining the proven Universal Framework structure and essential guardrails.
