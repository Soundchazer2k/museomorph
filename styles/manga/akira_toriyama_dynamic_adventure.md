# Akira Toriyama

**Version:** 4.2 (Toriyama Calibration) **Evidence Base:** 18 authenticated artworks analyzed via forensic examination **Purpose:** Generate authentic Akira Toriyama-style manga art with period-accurate technical specifications

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter - Toriyama Calibration

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Character identity via silhouette/gesture/expression, not photographic accuracy
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Material application methods supersede visual appearance descriptions
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately exaggerated or stylized aesthetics when authentic to Toriyama's approach
- **Face-Treatment Flags (Toriyama-Specific):**
  - *Primary Mode:* `toriyama-ink-watercolor`, `manga-traditional-inking`, `jump-magazine-production`
  - *Line Quality Evolution:* `early-soft-rounded` (gag comic era), `mid-angular-sharp` (action era), `late-lean-refined` (modern era)

- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid generic anime style, modern digital smoothing, or non-Toriyama character archetypes
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail

------

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** (classical portrait manga format) - ignore source image dimensions completely
- Redraw in **Akira Toriyama 1990s Peak Shonen Manga Style** for **clean manga illustration**
- Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression using Toriyama's character design principles
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original character designs avoiding Dragon Ball copyrighted elements while maintaining authentic Toriyama aesthetic
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `toriyama-ink-watercolor`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `power-stance-energy`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Toriyama's technical execution and character design philosophy supersedes source image characteristics
- **Mode Selector:** Clean manga illustration (no text elements)

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- `3:4` (classical manga portrait format, optimized for B5 Weekly Shonen Jump proportions)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Strict recomposition for 3:4 manga portrait format
- **Spatial Allocation:** Character dominance ≥70%, following Toriyama's character-centric composition principles
- **Background Treatment:** Minimal backgrounds with smooth, cylindrical architectural elements if present
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio serves traditional manga reading patterns and character focus

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Walt Disney character animation, Osamu Tezuka manga foundation, Journey to the West narrative archetypes
- **Medium/Production method:** Traditional mechanical pen and Indian ink for line art, watercolor over ink foundation, B5 recycled paper substrate
- **Thematic purpose:** Character archetype expression through visual design, trope inversion principles
- **3-5 hallmark motifs:**
  1. Triangular eyebrows with outer-end hatching (mandatory)
  2. Parallel horizontal line patterns on colored fields (Saiyan armor motif)
  3. Two-mode eye treatment: circular (neutral) vs blocky/square (intense)
  4. Compacted facial features with small pointy noses and large mouths
  5. Cheek curve indication through strategic hatching
- **Period framing:** 1990s Weekly Shonen Jump golden era, deadline-driven commercial manga production
- **Tone Tag:** Adventure-comedy with action potential, optimistic energy
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Rotary press printing limitations, resin plate monochrome rendering, hand-assembly binding process

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line Quality:** Angular, sharp line weight for action scenes with 2-3mm variation in stroke thickness; aggressive line weight avoiding soft/rounded early period style
- **Eye Construction:** Large eyes with proportionally small irises/pupils, omit tear ducts completely, implement blocky/square mode for intense expressions with 15-20% size increase over circular mode
- **Facial Anatomy - Male Characters:** Angular jawline with pronounced definition, square to rectangular face proportions, sharp cheekbone definition with strategic hatching, prominent angular chin construction
- **Facial Anatomy - Female Characters:** Three primary face shapes: heart-shaped (pointed delicate chin, wider forehead), oval (gentle curves throughout), or round (youthful circular proportions). Consistently soft jawlines, minimal to no harsh angular hatching on cheeks, delicate pointed or rounded chins
- **Eye Treatment - Male Characters:** Standard eye size with blocky/square mode for intensity, circular mode for neutral
- **Eye Treatment - Female Characters:** Eyes 120-130% larger than male proportions, predominantly circular/rounded shape even in intense situations, pronounced eyelash definition, larger iris-to-eye ratio with detailed iris patterns
- **Eyebrow Treatment:** Mandatory triangular shape with precise parallel line hatching at outer 30% of eyebrow length
- **Cheek Definition:** Strategic hatching curves indicating facial structure, 3-5 parallel lines maximum per cheek
- **Anatomical Proportions - Male Characters:** Mid-career buffed anatomy with enhanced neck thickness (140% standard proportion), shoulder-to-waist ratio 1.8:1, compact torso build
- **Anatomical Proportions - Female Characters:** Narrow shoulders (65% of male width), clear waist taper with hourglass silhouette, hip-to-shoulder ratio 1.2:1, longer torso proportion, minimal muscle definition with sleek athletic build
- **Color Application:** Watercolor washes that preserve ink outlines, avoid color bleeding over line work, maintain traditional media authenticity
- **Signature Pattern Integration:** Parallel horizontal lines on yellow/ochre colored fields, 2mm spacing between lines, applied to armor or clothing elements
- **Surface Depth:** Ink line work raised 0.5mm above paper surface (traditional pen pressure), watercolor absorption into recycled paper texture
- **Material Simulation:** B5 recycled paper absorbency characteristics affecting color saturation and edge quality

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

- **Wardrobe tracks:** Adventure-fantasy hybrid clothing with anachronistic technology integration

- **Female Clothing Philosophy:** All garments designed with silhouette priority - form-fitting elements that reveal waist definition and hip curves, strategic coverage showing feminine body lines while maintaining adventure functionality, jewelry and decorative elements integrated into functional gear

- **Male Clothing Philosophy:** Loose-fitting practical garments emphasizing functionality over form, minimal decorative elements, focus on durability and movement

- **Fabric behavior:** Female - form-fitting contours following body shape; Male - loose geometric forms with minimal complexity

- **Accessory caps:** Female 2-3 decorative elements (jewelry, ornamental details); Male 0-2 functional props maximum

- **Color palette - Female:** Higher saturation tolerance, broader range including purples, pinks, pastels alongside earth tones, more color contrast and decorative patterning

- **Color palette - Male:** Low-saturation watercolor palette, limited to earth tones with selective bright accents, minimal pattern complexity

- **Wardrobe variation required:** Cycle through Toriyama's documented color combinations: orange/blue, purple/yellow, earth tones with metal accents

- **Props:** Maximum 1 hero prop (weapon/tool/vehicle element) supporting character archetype

- **Coherence filter:** All elements support adventure-fantasy genre with sci-fi anachronisms; fallback = clean character focus

- **YAML prop pools:**

  ```yaml
  adventure_props:  - energy_staff  - capsule_container  - martial_arts_weapon  - mechanical_accessoryclothing_elements:  - gi_training_outfit  - armor_with_horizontal_lines  - adventure_gear  - cylindrical_tech_accessories
  ```

- **Clean Art Focus:** Pure illustration without mastheads, sound effects, or dialogue
- **Character-Centric:** Composition designed for character expression and archetype communication
- **Visual Narrative:** Meaning conveyed through pose, expression, and visual design elements only
- **Format-Specific Text Rules:** N/A - text completely omitted for clean manga art piece
- **Production Method Integration:** N/A - focusing on illustration elements only

------

## Toriyama-Specific Validation Anchors

- **Triangular Eyebrow Test:** Eyebrows must be triangular with outer-end hatching
- **Eye Mode Verification:** Circular OR blocky/square treatment based on character mood/intensity
- **Signature Pattern Check:** Parallel horizontal lines present on at least one colored element
- **Anatomical Period Accuracy:** Mid-career buffed proportions with enhanced neck/shoulder development
- **Line Quality Confirmation:** Angular, sharp line weight avoiding early-period soft/rounded style
- **Color Technique Validation:** Traditional watercolor over ink, no digital coloring effects
- **Archetype Expression Test:** Character design communicates clear archetypal role through visual elements
- **Production Authenticity:** All elements reflect 1990s Weekly Shonen Jump production constraints and capabilities
- **Composition Clarity:** "Easy to understand" principle - immediate visual comprehension of character and action
- **Material Surface Accuracy:** B5 recycled paper characteristics affect all color and line rendering
