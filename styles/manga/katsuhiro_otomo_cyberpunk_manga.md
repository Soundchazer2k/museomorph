# Katsuhiro Otomo Manga

**Version:** 4.2
 **Specificity:** Cyberpunk/Dystopian Manga (1982-1990 Production Era)
 **Visual Evidence Base:** 18 reference images analyzed
 **Purpose:** Authentic replication of Otomo's signature 1980s manga aesthetic with period-accurate production methods

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source dimensions; compose for manga cover format 2:3 ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("40% feature compression", "8-12% nose width") override descriptive language ("compressed", "small nose")
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** Otomo-specific flags permitted when standard options fail authenticity requirements
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately uncomfortable or challenging aesthetics when historically accurate
- **Evidence-Based Precedence:** All specifications derived from visual analysis of authentic Otomo covers and pages
- **Production Era Lock:** 1982-1990 manga techniques only - screentone dots 60-85 LPI, no digital effects
- **Otomo-Specific Flags:**
  - *Face Treatment:* `compressed-features-mandatory`, `button-nose-uniform`, `open-eye-corners`, `large-forehead-40-percent`, `center-feature-clustering`
  - *Background Style:* `metabolist-architecture`, `technical-debris-field`, `massive-scale-structures`, `post-apocalyptic-urban`
  - *Production Method:* `authentic-screentone-dots`, `1980s-manga-printing`, `halftone-60-85-LPI`, `mechanical-precision-linework`
  - *Color Approach:* `single-hue-dominance`, `high-contrast-80-20`, `dystopian-palette-primary`
  - *Pose Anchors:* `power-stance-dominance`, `technical-object-interaction`, `ceremonial-positioning`, `scale-contrast-emphasis`
- **Canvas Control Flags:** `strict-reframe` (mandatory for manga format)
- **Material Physics Authority:** Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Viewing distance requirements affect brushwork precision and detail hierarchy
- **Cultural Production Authenticity:** Japanese manga methods take precedence over modern interpretations
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; original character design avoiding copyrighted Akira elements
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic screentone characteristics
- **Period Production Authenticity:** For 1980s manga style, use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and screentone limitations - avoid modern digital perfection
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.)
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 manga cover ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely
- Redraw in **Katsuhiro Otomo 1980s Cyberpunk Manga Style** for **clean manga cover print**
- Identity via compressed facial features, button nose, large forehead silhouette
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original character avoiding Akira copyrighted elements, maintaining authentic Otomo aesthetic
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `compressed-features-mandatory`
- **Pose Flag:** `power-stance-dominance`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Otomo's dystopian realism dominates all other considerations
- **Mode:** Manga cover art (clean print, no masthead)

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (manga cover standard)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with character dominance
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject placement center-dominant 65-80% frame occupation
- **Background Treatment:** Metabolist architecture or technical debris field extending to edges
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 ratio serves manga cover format with character prominence and architectural detail capacity

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Post-war Japanese Metabolist architecture, Western cyberpunk literature, nuclear anxiety themes
- **Medium:** Traditional manga production - dip pen and Indian ink on professional manga paper with screentone application
- **Thematic Purpose:** Dystopian urban anxiety, technological power structures, post-apocalyptic society
- **Quantified Hallmark Motifs:**
  1. Compressed facial features (central 40% face height clustering)
  2. Uniform button noses (8-12% face width)
  3. Metabolist architectural backgrounds (200-400% character scale)
  4. Technical debris fields (40-60% background density)
  5. Single hue color dominance (70-85% coverage)
- **Period Framing:** 1982-1990 Japanese manga production methods
- **Tone Tag:** Dystopian-technological-anxiety
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Analog screentone techniques, mechanical dot patterns, photographic reduction from B4 to publication format

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line Quality:** Clean mechanical precision, 0.3mm base weight, 0.8mm emphasis strokes, architectural drafting influence
- **Facial Construction:** Compressed feature positioning - eyes/nose/mouth in central 40% face height, forehead 35-40% total height
- **Button Nose Specification:** Uniform tiny shape 8-12% face width across all characters
- **Eye Treatment:** Open corners (no closed eyelid meeting), minimal line economy, subtle hatching under socket
- **Screentone Application:** Authentic dot patterns 60-85 LPI, halftone gradients 20-80% black in 10% intervals
- **Background Detail Hierarchy:** Extreme technical precision in architectural elements, intricate mechanical debris rendering
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Massive architecture 200-400% character height, character figure dominance 65-80% frame
- **Material Authenticity:** Traditional dip pen texture, Indian ink opacity, professional manga paper interaction
- **Production Method Anchor:** B4 original format reduced to publication size, screentone moiré potential, scanning threshold considerations
- **Pose Specification:** Power stance variations, technical object interaction, ceremonial positioning with scale contrast

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

- **Wardrobe Categories:** Post-apocalyptic urban (leather jackets, technical gear), ceremonial power (formal/military styling), street youth (casual 1980s Japanese)

- **Fabric Behavior:** Heavy leather drape, technical material stiffness, period-accurate 1980s styling

- **Color Coordination:** Support single dominant hue system - if red dominant, incorporate red leather/fabric elements

- **Accessory Cap:** Minimalist 0-2 items maximum - technical gear (goggles, comm devices) or power symbols (insignia)

- **Props:** 1 hero prop maximum - motorcycle/technical vehicle OR ceremonial object, total ≤1 for clean composition

- **Coherence Filter:** All elements support cyberpunk-dystopian theme, fallback to clean scene

- **YAML Prop Pools:**

  ```yaml
  technical_props: [motorcycle, communication_device, weapon, technical_apparatus]power_props: [throne, ceremonial_staff, authority_symbol]urban_props: [debris_fragment, architectural_element]
  ```

------

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

- **Canvas Negatives (Evidence-Based Anti-Patterns):**
  - "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "varied nose shapes"
  - "closed eye corners", "multiple color dominance", "soft organic backgrounds"
  - "digital screentone simulation", "modern post-processing", "decorative frames"
  - "gentle features", "harmonious composition", "pleasant aesthetics"
- **Canvas Positives (Mandatory Elements):**
  - "exactly 2:3 manga cover ratio", "compressed facial features central 40%"
  - "uniform button nose 8-12% width", "open eye corners", "single hue dominance 70-85%"
  - "Metabolist architecture background", "technical debris field", "mechanical precision linework"
  - "authentic screentone dots 60-85 LPI", "power stance dominance", "dystopian urban anxiety"

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (2:3 Portrait):**

- Vertical emphasis with character dominance ≥65%
- Hierarchical staging: Character > Architecture > Debris > Detail
- Format-specific layout: Manga cover reading pattern consideration

**OTOMO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective Regime:** Cinematic framing with wide-shot architectural establishment
- **Figure:Ground Ratio:** 65-80% character dominance, 35-20% background context
- **Density Specification:** High architectural detail 40-60% background area
- **Lighting Logic:** High contrast single-source creating dramatic shadows
- **Metabolist Architecture Anchor:** Massive ultra-modern structures conveying environmental oppression
- **Technical Debris Field:** Mechanical remnants 40-60% density supporting post-apocalyptic theme
- **Scale Contrast Anchor:** Architecture 200-400% character height emphasizing dystopian overwhelm

**REQUIRED COMPOSITION ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context:** Manga page/cover paper surface, no external framing
- **Production Context:** 1980s manga printing with characteristic dot patterns
- **Ratio Enforcement:** Composition designed specifically for 2:3 format, not adapted

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

- **Text Policy:** OMIT entirely for clean art print
- **If Text Required:** Period-appropriate manga typography with authentic production limitations
- **Historical Accuracy:** 1980s Japanese typesetting methods with registration drift characteristics

------

## Evidence-Based Validation Requirements

**MANDATORY AUTHENTICITY CHECKS:**

- ✅ Facial compression: Central 40% feature clustering
- ✅ Button nose uniformity: 8-12% face width specification
- ✅ Open eye corners: No closed eyelid meetings
- ✅ Single hue dominance: 70-85% color coverage
- ✅ 2:3 ratio enforcement with manga cover composition
- ✅ Metabolist architecture or technical debris background
- ✅ Authentic screentone patterns (not digital simulation)
- ✅ Character dominance 65-80% frame occupation
- ✅ Power stance or ceremonial positioning
- ✅ Production era consistency (1982-1990 methods)

**ANTI-PATTERN VERIFICATION:**

- ❌ No closed eye corners (contradicts 100% open corner evidence)
- ❌ No varied nose shapes (contradicts uniform button nose data)
- ❌ No multiple color dominance (contradicts single hue evidence)
- ❌ No digital effects (contradicts analog production era)
- ❌ No decorative frames (contradicts clean manga page evidence)

**TECHNICAL PRECISION ANCHORS:**

- Line weights: 0.3mm base, 0.8mm emphasis
- Screentone: 60-85 LPI authentic dot patterns
- Color ratios: 80% pure hue, 20% neutral contrast
- Scale measurements: Architecture 200-400% character height

This framework ensures authentic Katsuhiro Otomo manga style replication based on comprehensive visual evidence analysis while maintaining the enhanced Universal Framework v4.2 structure and precision requirements.
