------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**LINE QUALITY ANCHOR:** Hair-thin precision pen work for textile detail, bold confident outlines for character definition. No scratchy or rough line application - only clean, deliberate mark-making.

**SCREENTONE MASTERY ANCHOR:** 3-5 different screentone patterns per illustration minimum for B&W work. Sophisticated layering for texture differentiation, material properties, and atmospheric depth. No flat uniform gray areas.

**TEXTILE DETAIL OBSESSION ANCHOR:** Individual thread-level detail in all fabric rendering. Authentic weaving patterns, embroidery construction, cultural textile accuracy visible. Generic fabric patterns prohibited.

**HISTORICAL RESEARCH ANCHOR:** 100% period accuracy in all visible objects, architecture, clothing, and cultural artifacts. Every element must be documentably authentic to declared time period.

**ENVIRONMENTAL EQUALITY ANCHOR:** Backgrounds receive equal detail attention to character rendering. Architectural elements rendered with documentary precision. Empty or simplified backgrounds prohibited.
