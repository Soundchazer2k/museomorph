# Osamu Tezuka Manga

**Version:** 1.0
 **Purpose:** Evidence-based framework for replicating Osamu Tezuka's distinctive manga illustration style based on forensic analysis of authentic works from 1946-1980s.

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("eye width 40% of face", "3mm brush line weight") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**
  - *Tezuka Manga Core:* `ink-confident-line`, `watercolor-transparent`, `gouache-flat-color`, `brush-lettering-integration`, `cell-animation-shading`, `disney-eye-influence`, `emotional-clarity-priority`
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `cinematic-dynamic`, `heroic-stance`, `emotional-gesture`, `action-trajectory`, `disney-inspired-movement`
- **Canvas Control Flags (choose one):** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`, `format-native`
- **Material Physics Authority:** Ink, watercolor, and gouache specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Star System Authorization:** Use of recurring Tezuka character archetypes permitted and encouraged.
- **Emotional Clarity Mandate:** Expression must be immediately readable from silhouette and gesture.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks; original character designs only.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1950s-1960s Japanese manga production methods with hand-lettering and manual color separation.

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Osamu Tezuka Disney-Influenced Shōwa-Era Cinematic Manga** style for **clean manga illustration**.
- Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression with Disney-influenced emotional clarity.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original character design using Tezuka's "Star System" archetypes.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `disney-eye-influence` with `emotional-clarity-priority`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `cinematic-dynamic`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Tezuka's visual language dominates over photorealistic accuracy.
- **Mode Selector:** Clean manga illustration (gallery print quality).

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- `4:5` (Tezuka preferred portrait format for character studies)
- `2:3` (standard manga cover proportion)
- `1:1` (square format for character portraits)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely for Tezuka's cinematic composition
- **Spatial Allocation:** Central character placement with 60-70% figure dominance
- **Background Treatment:** Simplified or atmospheric elements supporting character focus
- **Format Justification:** Chosen ratio serves Tezuka's character-centric storytelling approach

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Walt Disney (Bambi, Snow White), early American animation, Fleischer Studios, Felix the Cat, post-war Japanese humanist themes
- **Medium/Production method:** Ink line work with watercolor/gouache color application, authentic 1950s manga production techniques
- **Thematic purpose:** Post-war hope, humanism, technology vs. nature duality, emotional storytelling
- **Hallmark motifs:** Large expressive eyes with multiple highlights, simplified facial features, dynamic hair rendering, "Star System" character archetypes, cinematic panel flow
- **Period framing:** Shōwa-era Japan (1946-1989), post-war reconstruction period
- **Tone Tag:** Optimistic humanism with Disney-influenced emotional clarity
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Hand-lettered typography, manual color separation, phototypesetting integration

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line Quality:** Clean confident ink outlines, 2-3mm brush weight, minimal interior detail, economy of line with maximum emotional impact
- **Eye Construction:** 40% of face width, multiple highlight dots (primary upper-left large, secondary lower-right small), Disney-influenced tear-drop shape, clear emotional reading
- **Hair Rendering:** Chunked segments with dynamic flow, 15-20 distinct hair masses (not individual strands), movement lines integrated, each chunk 8-12mm width for proper scale
- **Color Application:** Flat gouache/watercolor areas with soft edge gradations, 70% flat color + 30% gradient transitions
- **Shading Technique:** Cell-animation style color blocking, no photorealistic rendering, strategic shadow placement for emotional emphasis
- **Surface Treatment:** Matte finish suggesting traditional media, visible paper texture through transparent washes
- **Character Proportion:** Disney-influenced stylization, head-to-body ratio varies by character type (child protagonists 1:3, adult characters 1:6)
- **Pose Dynamics:** Cinematic angles with 30-45 degree perspective shifts, movement lines indicating action trajectory
- **Background Integration:** 70% figure focus, 30% environmental support, simplified geometric shapes for architectural elements

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Categories:**

- **Child Hero (Astro Boy type):** Simple shorts/tunic, primary color blocking, minimal accessories
- **Adventure Hero:** Flowing cape/coat, boots, heroic silhouette with dynamic fabric movement
- **Authority Figure:** Formal wear, angular design, imposing color scheme (dark blues, blacks)
- **Fantasy Character:** Period-appropriate costume with ornate details, theatrical presentation

**Fabric Behavior:** Simplified drape with Disney-influenced animation principles, fabric follows action lines **Accessory Caps:** Minimalist 0-2 accessories maximum, focus on character essence **Color Palette:** Primary colors (red, blue, yellow) with strategic black/white contrast, limited 3-4 color schemes **Props:** Maximum 1 hero prop that supports character archetype and narrative function

**YAML Prop Pools:**

```yaml
sci_fi: [robot_companion, ray_gun, control_device, flying_vehicle]
adventure: [sword, cape, mask, heroic_insignia]
everyday: [book, musical_instrument, simple_tool]
fantasy: [magic_staff, crown, mystical_object, creature_companion]
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**Canvas Negatives (≥2):**

- "photorealistic rendering", "modern digital effects", "complex interior detail", "cynical narrative tone", "hyper-realistic anatomy", "photographic accuracy", "modern manga style", "excessive fine detail", "individual hair strands", "realistic fabric textures", "environmental clutter", "detailed finger anatomy", "knuckle definition", "fabric folds", "material physics", "textile realism", "strand-level hair", "architectural complexity", "environmental competition", "nose modeling", "iris detail", "complex shading"
