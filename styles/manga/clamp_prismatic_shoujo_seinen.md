## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (tankōbon manga format) - ignore source image dimensions completely
- Redraw in **CLAMP Late 20th/Early 21st Century Prismatic Shoujo-Seinen Synthesis Style** for **clean manga illustration**
- Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression using CLAMP's distinctive elongated character design principles
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original character designs avoiding copyrighted CLAMP elements while maintaining authentic aesthetic synthesis
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `clamp-copic-application`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid-dynamic`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** CLAMP's prismatic genre synthesis and extreme elongation supersedes source image characteristics
- **Mode Selector:** Clean manga illustration (no text elements)

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- `2:3` (tankōbon manga format, optimized for serialized publication reading flow)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Strict recomposition for 2:3 vertical manga format
- **Spatial Allocation:** Character dominance ≥75%, following CLAMP's character-breaking-boundaries composition principles
- **Background Treatment:** Two-mode approach - intricate architectural detail OR decorative floral abstraction
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 ratio serves cinematic manga storytelling with vertical character emphasis

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Japanese esoteric traditions (Shinto animism, onmyoudou), Eastern mythology (Hindu/Buddhist synthesis), cross-cultural syncretism, Osamu Tezuka cinematographic manga techniques
- **Medium/Production method:** Copic alcohol-based markers for color work, traditional screentone sheets for monochrome shading, pen and ink for line art, offset lithography printing
- **Thematic purpose:** Prismatic genre synthesis transcending shoujo-seinen boundaries, elegant elongation for emotional expression
- **3-5 hallmark motifs:**
  1. Extreme intentional figure elongation with spindly limbs and extended necks (quantified at 150-200% standard proportions)
  2. Large expressive eyes as primary emotional vehicle with minimal nose detail
  3. Dynamic energetic line work creating motion in still images
  4. Decorative floral patterns and abstract filigree as compositional elements
  5. Characters breaking panel boundaries through dynamic positioning
- **Period framing:** 1989-present serialized manga era, commercial doujinshi evolution to mainstream publication
- **Tone Tag:** Lyrical dynamism with coexistence of composure and turbulence
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Offset lithography printing with halftone screen ruling 85-185 lpi depending on paper quality

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line Quality:** Elegantly modulated dynamic line weight varying from 0.5mm to 3mm thickness, energetic sweeping strokes that convey motion and emotion simultaneously
- **Anatomical Elongation - Male Characters:** 160% standard proportions with spindly limbs and extended necks, angular facial features with defined jawlines, broad shoulders with minimal waist taper, controlled longer hair with less flowing movement
- **Anatomical Elongation - Female Characters:** 200-250% standard proportions with extremely spindly limbs and preposterously extended necks, soft rounded facial features with delicate pointed chins, narrow shoulders (60% male width), pronounced waist definition with longer legs
- **Hair Treatment - Male Characters:** Controlled styling with less flowing movement, shorter styles or controlled longer hair
- **Hair Treatment - Female Characters:** Dynamic energetic movement within existing hair length constraints - short hair maintains length with animated movement, long hair receives extreme flowing physics-defying treatment
- **Eye Construction - Male Characters:** Standard to slightly narrowed eyes serving functional role, minimal emotional emphasis
- **Eye Construction - Female Characters:** Eyes 160-180% larger than male proportions serving as primary emotional vehicle, maximum expressiveness with detailed iris patterns
- **Color Application Technique:** Copic alcohol-based marker direct blending and layering on paper creating seamless gradients, vibrant saturated hues without digital intervention
- **Screentone Application:** Traditional preprinted texture sheets with wax adhesive applied by stylus rubbing, modified with X-Acto blade scratching for starburst effects
- **Decorative Integration:** Intricate costume details with 3-5 decorative elements per character, flowing ribbons and fabric with physics-defying movement, floral motifs integrated into backgrounds
- **Surface Depth:** Traditional screentone layering creating potential Moiré patterns, halftone dot visibility at 85-185 lpi resolution
- **Cinematic Composition:** Varied camera angles including dramatic close-ups and distance shots, rapid zoom effects, irregular panel layouts with borderless elements

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

- **Wardrobe tracks:** Cross-cultural fantasy synthesis combining Eastern traditional elements with futuristic science fiction details

- **Male Clothing Philosophy:** Geometric cuts with structured garments, minimal decorative elements, emphasis on functionality and clean lines, flowing coats and capes for dramatic silhouettes

- **Female Clothing Philosophy:** Flowing fabrics with elaborate decorative details, form-revealing silhouettes showing anatomical differences, intricate costume elements with 3-4 decorative accessories

- **Fabric behavior:** Dynamic flowing movement that defies physics, creating sweeping curves and dramatic poses even in stillness

- **Accessory caps:** Male 1-2 functional elements; Female 3-4 decorative elements including jewelry, ribbons, ornamental details

- **Color palette:** Vibrant Copic marker saturation with seamless gradient transitions, broader range including pastels and bold contrasts for emotional emphasis

- **Wardrobe variation required:** Cycle through CLAMP's documented synthesis of traditional/modern/fantasy elements

- **Props:** Maximum 1 hero prop supporting thematic elements (mystical artifacts, technological devices, ceremonial objects)

- **Coherence filter:** All elements support prismatic genre synthesis; fallback = clean character focus

- **YAML prop pools:**

  ```yaml
  mystical_props:  - ceremonial_staff  - magical_artifacts  - floating_elements  - energy_manifestationscultural_synthesis:  - eastern_traditional_elements  - futuristic_technology  - cross_cultural_fusion  - architectural_details
  ```
