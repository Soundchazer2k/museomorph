# Kamome Shirahama Manga

**Version:** 4.2
 **Specificity:** European-Influenced Fantasy Manga (2010s-Present Production Era)
 **Visual Evidence Base:** 20 reference images analyzed
 **Purpose:** Authentic replication of Shirahama's signature European illustration-manga hybrid aesthetic with period-accurate production methods

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source dimensions; compose for manga cover format (2:3 or 4:5 ratio)
- **Style over likeness:** Apply Shirahama's techniques to preserve model identity via silhouette/gesture/expression
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("contour hatching density", "Art Nouveau geometric ratios") override descriptive language ("detailed linework", "decorative framing")
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** Shirahama-specific flags permitted when standard options fail authenticity requirements
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately complex or ornate aesthetics when historically accurate
- **Evidence-Based Precedence:** All specifications derived from visual analysis of authentic Shirahama covers and pages
- **Production Era Lock:** 2010s-present European-manga hybrid techniques - contour hatching emphasis, no screentones, printmaking emulation
- **Shirahama-Specific Flags:**
  - *Line Treatment:* `contour-hatching-primary`, `organic-pen-pressure`, `engraving-texture-emulation`, `hand-drawn-authenticity`, `meticulous-line-control`
  - *Style Context:* `european-manga-hybrid`, `art-nouveau-influence`, `printmaking-aesthetic`, `fantasy-medieval-setting`
  - *Composition Approach:* `decorative-geometric-framing`, `integrated-panel-breaking`, `ornamental-border-elements`, `complex-spatial-layering`
  - *Production Method:* `no-screentones-mandatory`, `pure-linework-shading`, `copperplate-engraving-emulation`, `traditional-ink-application`
  - *Character Design:* `european-fantasy-proportions`, `realistic-anatomy`, `detailed-costume-work`, `medieval-renaissance-styling`
- **Canvas Control Flags:** `strict-reframe` (mandatory for manga format)
- **Material Physics Authority:** Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Viewing distance requirements affect hatching density and detail hierarchy
- **Cultural Production Authenticity:** European illustration traditions adapted to manga format take precedence over pure Japanese methods
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; original character design avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented identity within European fantasy context
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic ink-on-paper characteristics with visible pen pressure variation
- **Period Production Authenticity:** For European-manga hybrid style, use period-appropriate printmaking techniques with hand-drawn line quality - avoid modern digital vector perfection
- **Printmaking Authority:** Traditional copperplate engraving and lithographic texture supersedes digital smoothness; authentic hand-inked characteristics required
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits except period-appropriate decorative elements
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, digital screentone automation, vector line perfection, etc.)
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail
