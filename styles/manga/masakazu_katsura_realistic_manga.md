 **Purpose:** Authentic reproduction of Masakazu Katsura's signature realistic manga style with genre-specific adaptations

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**CONSTRAINT PRECEDENCE:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.

**CANVAS OVERRIDE MANDATE:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.

**STYLE OVER LIKENESS:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.

**TECHNICAL MEASUREMENT AUTHORITY:** Quantitative specifications ("150% neck elongation", "3-5mm paint thickness") override descriptive language.

**PROCESS-OVER-RESULT PRIORITY:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions.

**CUSTOM FLAG AUTHORIZATION:** Artist-specific flags permitted when standard options fail authenticity requirements.

**ANTI-CONVENTIONAL BIAS:** Authority to generate deliberately uncomfortable or challenging aesthetics when historically accurate.

**FACE-TREATMENT FLAGS (choose one appropriate to genre):**

- *Seinen Realistic:* `pen-crosshatch-shadows`, `high-contrast-dramatic`, `mature-facial-structure`, `psychological-intensity`, `gritty-environmental-integration`
- *Shonen Romance:* `clean-manga-lines`, `expressive-eyes-detailed`, `soft-screening-romance`, `naturalistic-proportion`, `contemporary-fashion-accurate`
- *Hero Adventure:* `confident-linework`, `heroic-proportion-realistic`, `tokusatsu-inspired-design`, `dynamic-pose-natural`, `costume-detail-technical`
- *Slice-of-Life:* `gentle-detailed-rendering`, `environmental-integration-heavy`, `casual-pose-authentic`, `school-uniform-accurate`, `intimate-framing-cinematic`

**POSE FLAGS (choose one):** `naturalistic-attractive`, `psychological-tension`, `tokusatsu-inspired`, `contemporary-casual`, `emotional-subtlety`, `confident-heroic`, `youth-authentic`, `mature-contemplative`

**CANVAS CONTROL FLAGS (choose one):** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`, `format-native`, `source-respect`

**MEDIA HYBRID FLAG (optional):** `manga-illustration-hybrid`, `traditional-digital-blend`

**MATERIAL PHYSICS AUTHORITY:** Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences.

**SCALE-DEPENDENT TECHNIQUE:** Viewing distance requirements affect brushwork precision and detail hierarchy.

**CULTURAL PRODUCTION AUTHENTICITY:** Indigenous and traditional methods take precedence over modern interpretations.

**QUANTIFIERS AUTHORITATIVE:** Numeric anchors are targets.

**TEXT POLICY:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes.

**SAFETY/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures.

**AGE & WARDROBE GUARDRAIL:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.

**GENDER EXPRESSION:** Respect presented.

**MATERIAL AUTHENTICITY:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics.

**PERIOD PRODUCTION AUTHENTICITY:** For historical publication styles (comics, magazines, prints), use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection.

**COMPOSITION BOUNDARIES:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.

**FAILURE MODE FLAGS:** Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.).

**SILENT VALIDATION:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[declared ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely.

**COLOR SPECIFICATION MANDATORY:** Create color illustration in Katsura's authentic palette style with soft naturalistic colors, period-appropriate 1990s-2000s color limitations, avoiding oversaturated modern digital colors.

Redraw in **Masakazu Katsura's signature realistic manga style** for **color illustration format**.

**IP SAFEGUARD DECLARATION:** Create original character design avoiding copyrighted manga elements while maintaining Katsura's authentic technical approach.

**KATSURA STYLE DOMINANCE:** Naturalistic anatomy with cinematic pose work, expressive facial detail, authentic 1990s Japanese youth fashion, and genre-appropriate environmental integration.

**MANDATORY WARDROBE CONSTRAINT:** Character must wear authentic 1990s casual youth fashion - oversized silhouettes, baggy clothing, period-appropriate Japanese street wear. NO business suits, formal wear, or fitted contemporary clothing.

**GENRE MODE SELECTOR:** [slice_of_life_casual / school_life_authentic / youth_romance / urban_contemporary]

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

**PREFERRED KATSURA FORMATS:**

- `3:4` (classic portrait - optimal for character focus)
- `2:3` (manga cover format - used in I's, Zetman volumes)
- `4:3` (landscape illustration - environmental integration)
- `1:1` (decorative portrait - character card style)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** extend-background-detailed / recompose-character-focused
- **Spatial Allocation:** Character prominence 60-80% with detailed environmental support
- **Background Treatment:** Meticulously detailed realistic environments that ground character
- **Format Justification:** Ratio serves character-environment relationship and viewing intimacy

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**PRIMARY INFLUENCES:** Cinema and novels over manga conventions, tokusatsu hero aesthetics, naturalistic observation

**MEDIUM/PRODUCTION:** Traditional pen and ink on manga manuscript paper, screentone application for texture, offset lithography reproduction with visible halftone patterns

**THEMATIC PURPOSE:** Character-driven realism with emotional psychological depth

**HALLMARK MOTIFS (quantified):**

1. **Bishōjo Realism:** Female characters with deeply expressive eyes, varied realistic body figures, contemporary fashion research accuracy, anatomical quirk in pelvis/femur articulation
2. **Convincing Sci-Fi Detail:** Technology and fantastical elements rendered with photographic reference accuracy, 90% environmental detail consistency
3. **Naturalistic Anatomy:** Immaculate anatomical foundation, avoid exaggerated proportions by 85%, realistic human movement and gesture
4. **Cinematic Emotional Framing:** Dramatic close-ups on faces for psychological revelation, emotional state priority over action staging
5. **Contemporary Fashion Authority:** Research-accurate clothing, hairstyles, and cultural details for time period authenticity

**PERIOD FRAMING:** Late 20th Century Japanese manga production (1983-2014), traditional manga manuscript techniques

**TONE TAG:** [Select based on genre: Mature_Psychological_Realism / Romantic_Slice_of_Life / Heroic_Adventure_Grounded / Contemporary_Youth_Authentic]

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**LINE QUALITY ANCHOR:** Long, steady, clear pen lines avoiding scratchy application. Thick confident outlines for primary contours, thin precise lines for interior facial features and texture details.

**ANATOMICAL PRECISION ANCHOR:** Naturalistic human proportions with 95% anatomical accuracy. Signature pelvic/femur articulation quirk in female characters (15-degree angle variance from standard).

**FACIAL EXPRESSION ANCHOR:** Deeply expressive eyes with detailed iris rendering, subtle emotional complexity (puzzlement, shyness, internal conflict), avoid generic anime expressions by 90%.

**ENVIRONMENTAL DETAIL ANCHOR:** Meticulously researched backgrounds, 80% photographic reference accuracy, convincing perspective construction, "lived-in" space authenticity.

**POSE NATURALISM ANCHOR:** Cinematic emotional revelation priority, naturalistic gesture economy, psychological framing over stylized action, 70% close-up intimacy ratio.

**MATERIAL AUTHENTICITY ANCHOR:** Visible halftone patterns from offset lithography, screentone texture characteristics, traditional pen tool marks preserved.

**CONTEMPORARY ACCURACY ANCHOR:** Fashion, hairstyles, and cultural details researched for period authenticity, 90% real-world reference accuracy.

**COLOR APPLICATION ANCHOR:** Soft naturalistic color palette applied deliberately without blending with black pen outlines (traditional manga coloring method). Period-appropriate 1990s-2000s color limitations - avoid oversaturated modern digital colors. Atmospheric background colors that support character without competing.

**WARDROBE ACCURACY ANCHOR:** Mandatory 1990s Japanese youth fashion - oversized knit sweaters, baggy jeans, loose casual wear, authentic school uniforms with loose socks. NO business suits, formal wear, or fitted contemporary clothing. 90% period-appropriate fabric behavior and silhouette accuracy.
