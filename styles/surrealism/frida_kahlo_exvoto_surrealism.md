# Frida Kahlo

**Version:** 4.2 (Kahlo Specialized) **Artist Period:** 1929-1954 (Peak Period: 1938-1954) **Primary Technique:** Intensely Personal Surrealism via Ex-Voto Tradition and Mexican Folk Art

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via raw emotional honesty and symbolic self-revelation; intensely honest rather than flattering.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("small-scale format 30x40cm max", "unibrow width 15-20mm", "pain symbol density 60-70%") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Ex-voto narrative structure (personal trauma→symbolic representation→spiritual/defiant resolution) supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** Kahlo-specific trauma processing transformations permitted when standard surrealist options fail authenticity requirements.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate psychologically disturbing or physically explicit imagery when historically accurate to personal pain documentation.

### **Kahlo-Specific Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**

- `unflinching-self-examination`: Direct, confrontational gaze with unidealized features, honest documentation without flattery (for self-portraits)
- `masculine-subject-dignity`: Period-appropriate masculine features with respectful portraiture (for male subjects like father, Diego Rivera)
- `ex-voto-folk-precision`: Small-scale detailed portraiture following Mexican folk art conventions with narrative clarity over beauty
- `psychological-revelation-honest`: Facial expression revealing internal emotional state without glamorization or concealment
- `cultural-identity-authentic`: Features appropriate to subject's actual cultural identity and gender presentation

### **Kahlo-Specific Pose Flags (choose one):**

- `confrontational-direct-engagement`: Frontal positioning with direct eye contact challenging viewer expectations
- `medical-vulnerability-defiant`: Figure positioned to show physical trauma or medical intervention with dignified resistance
- `cultural-costume-political`: Positioning emphasizing traditional Mexican dress as statement of national and feminist identity
- `symbolic-narrative-integration`: Classical pose adapted for ex-voto storytelling with symbolic elements surrounding figure
- `domestic-space-transformed`: Intimate interior settings elevated to spiritual or mythological significance

### **Kahlo Canvas Control Flags (choose one):**

- `strict-reframe-intimate`: Recompose entirely for small-scale intimate narrative following ex-voto proportions
- `symbolic-extend-background`: Extend Mexican landscapes and cultural symbols with precise folk art detailing
- `pain-narrative-adaptation`: Canvas adaptation following trauma processing logic and spiritual transformation journey

### **Missing Renderer-Agnostic Guardrails**:

- **Media Hybrid Flag (optional)**: `ex-voto-mixed-media`, `folk-art-integration`, `medical-documentation-artistic`
- **Material Physics Authority**: Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences
- **Scale-Dependent Technique**: Viewing distance requirements affect brushwork precision and detail hierarchy
- **Cultural Production Authenticity**: Indigenous and traditional methods take precedence over modern interpretations
- **Quantifiers authoritative**: numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy**: Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP**: No nudity/gore beyond documented medical/artistic context; no real logos/watermarks/signatures
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail**: Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral
- **Gender expression**: Respect presented
- **Material authenticity**: No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics
- **Period Production Authenticity**: For historical publication styles, use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection
- **Composition boundaries**: No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits
- **Failure Mode Flags**: Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.)
- **Silent validation**: Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- `3:4` (portrait for self-examination and cultural identity assertion)
- `4:5` (intimate portrait for psychological studies and symbolic narratives)
- `1:1` (square for ex-voto format and balanced symbolic composition)
- `2:3` (poster format for cultural and political statements)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method**: extend-background with Mexican cultural environments (indigenous landscapes, domestic interiors, symbolic natural elements) following ex-voto narrative structure
- **Spatial Allocation**: Subject placement according to folk art hierarchy with figure dominance ≥60% and symbolic elements distributed for narrative clarity
- **Background Treatment**: Detailed extension of Mexican cultural landscapes with precise flora/fauna integration and symbolic density
- **Format Justification**: Canvas ratio optimized for Kahlo's intimate narrative structure and direct psychological engagement

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Medium/Production Method**: Oil on canvas, masonite, or metal sheets following Mexican ex-voto tradition. Small-scale format (maximum 30x40cm equivalent) with meticulous detail application. Traditional oil paint mixed with period-appropriate medium allowing precise detail work. Surface preparation following folk art traditions rather than academic standards.

**Thematic Purpose**: Processing personal trauma through spiritual and cultural transformation; challenging patriarchal and colonial authority through feminine Mexican identity assertion; documenting physical and emotional reality without idealization; transforming private pain into universal symbolic language.

**Period Framing**: Post-Revolutionary Mexican cultural renaissance (1920s-1950s) with specific focus on Mexicanidad movement and indigenous cultural reclamation. European Surrealist contact with Mexican magical realism synthesis.

**5 Hallmark Motifs with Quantified Specifications**:

1. **Duality and Division**: Split or double self-representation - 40-50% of composition showing internal conflict between European/Mexican, loved/unloved, healthy/broken identity
2. **Medical and Bodily Trauma**: Explicit physical documentation - exposed hearts, surgical scars, broken spines rendered with 90% medical accuracy within symbolic context
3. **Mexican Cultural Assertion**: Traditional dress, indigenous symbols, national flora/fauna - 60-70% of composition referencing specific Mexican cultural elements
4. **Natural World Integration**: Animals as psychological surrogates, plants reflecting life/death cycles - 50-60% organic element coverage with symbolic rather than decorative function
5. **Ex-Voto Narrative Structure**: Personal testimony format with miraculous/defiant resolution - 70-80% of composition following devotional painting conventions

**Tone Tag**: Raw emotional honesty, cultural identity assertion, trauma processing through symbolic transformation, defiant spiritual resilience.

**Innovation Line**: Ex-voto tradition adaptation enabling systematic personal trauma documentation through culturally authentic Mexican folk art precision and symbolic density.

- Cultural symbols: 95% authenticity to documented Mexican folk traditions
- Medical/anatomical elements: 90% scientific accuracy within symbolic transformation
- Background environments: 80% detail maintaining symbolic rather than realistic spatial relationships

**Material Simulation with Authentic Characteristics**: All surfaces rendered with material-specific behavior following Mexican craft traditions. Fabric textures showing authentic weave patterns, metal objects displaying period-appropriate manufacturing marks, organic elements exhibiting botanical accuracy.

**Pose Anchors**:

- Direct confrontation: Eyes meeting viewer with 90-100% frontal engagement
- Cultural positioning: Body stance emphasizing traditional Mexican dress with authentic posture conventions
- Medical vulnerability: Physical trauma or medical intervention shown with dignity rather than victimization
- Symbolic gesture integration: Hand positions carrying documented personal iconography (surgical tools, cultural objects, natural elements)

**Scale Hierarchy**: Proportional relationships follow psychological rather than realistic significance - symbolic elements sized according to emotional importance (pain symbols 150-200% enlarged, cultural assertions 120-150% emphasized).

**Material Authenticity**: Authentic oil painting surface with period-appropriate folk art characteristics. Small-scale precision requiring close viewing distance. No digital simulation of traditional media effects.

**Period Consistency**: All technical methods documented from 1929-1954 Kahlo studio practice in Coyoacán. Cultural elements authentic to post-Revolutionary Mexican artistic movements.
