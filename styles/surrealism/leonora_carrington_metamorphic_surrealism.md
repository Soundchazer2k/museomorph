------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via metamorphic transformation and impossible spatial integration; recognizable through archetypal rather than individual characteristics.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("elongated proportions 150-200%", "muted earth palette 70-80% desaturation", "impossible spatial relationships") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Tempera layering technique (smooth gesso preparation→earth-tone foundation→metamorphic integration→atmospheric impossibility) supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** Carrington-specific metamorphic transformations permitted when standard surrealist options fail authenticity requirements.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate anatomically impossible or spatially disturbing imagery when historically accurate to metamorphic transformation themes.

### **Carrington-Specific Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**

- `archetypal-simplified-features`: Smooth, doll-like facial features with enlarged eyes and simplified modeling - archetypal rather than individual characteristics
- `metamorphic-creature-integration`: Human facial features seamlessly blending with animal characteristics (owl-like eyes, elongated proportions) without costume elements
- `theatrical-ceremonial-presentation`: Features serving ritual narrative function rather than portrait likeness - mask-like quality supporting mysterious ceremony
- `timeless-mythological-modeling`: Face rendering that exists outside historical periods - neither ancient nor modern but psychologically constructed
- `psychological-symbol-features`: Facial characteristics emphasizing symbolic role over individual identity - smooth tempera precision with enlarged expressive eyes

### **Carrington-Specific Pose Flags (choose one):**

- `metamorphic-anatomical-transformation`: Figure positioning accommodating impossible anatomical changes (elongated limbs, animal-human transitions, impossible proportions)
- `ceremonial-ritual-positioning`: Choreographed positioning for mysterious ceremonies or ritual activities - theatrical rather than naturalistic
- `impossible-spatial-integration`: Figure placement defying normal perspective and spatial logic within architecturally impossible environments
- `archetypal-symbolic-stance`: Positioning emphasizing mythological or symbolic role rather than individual human gesture
- `theatrical-stage-arrangement`: Multiple figures arranged for narrative drama within psychologically constructed environments

### **Carrington Canvas Control Flags (choose one):**

- `strict-reframe-impossible`: Recompose entirely for spatially impossible environments and metamorphic creature integration
- `theatrical-extend-background`: Extend dream-stage environments that blend interior/exterior spatial logic with impossible architectural relationships
- `metamorphic-adaptation`: Canvas adaptation following transformation logic and impossible spatial construction principles

### **Missing Renderer-Agnostic Guardrails**:

- **Media Hybrid Flag (optional)**: `tempera-precision-mixed-media`, `metamorphic-material-integration`, `impossible-spatial-fusion`
- **Material Physics Authority**: Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences
- **Scale-Dependent Technique**: Viewing distance requirements affect brushwork precision and detail hierarchy
- **Cultural Production Authenticity**: Indigenous and traditional methods take precedence over modern interpretations
- **Quantifiers authoritative**: numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy**: Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP**: No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail**: Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral
- **Gender expression**: Respect presented
- **Material authenticity**: No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics
- **Period Production Authenticity**: For historical publication styles, use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection
- **Composition boundaries**: No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits
- **Failure Mode Flags**: Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.)
- **Silent validation**: Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- `3:4` (portrait for metamorphic transformation studies and impossible interior scenarios)
- `4:3` (landscape for theatrical environments and multiple creature integration)
- `1:1` (square for balanced ceremonial compositions and circular ritual arrangements)
- `4:5` (elongated portrait for vertical transformation emphasis and architectural impossibility)
- `5:3` (panoramic for horizontal ceremonial narratives and environmental metamorphosis)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method**: extend-background with spatially impossible environments (theatrical interior/exterior spaces, architecturally impossible rooms, ceremonial stages that defy perspective) following metamorphic narrative principles
- **Spatial Allocation**: Subject placement according to impossible spatial logic rather than realistic perspective - figures positioned for symbolic narrative within dream-constructed environments
- **Background Treatment**: Detailed extension of spatially impossible environments with precise tempera modeling - architectural spaces that bend logic while maintaining technical precision
- **Format Justification**: Canvas ratio optimized for Carrington's impossible spatial narratives and metamorphic transformation visualization through theatrical staging principles

2. **Spatially Impossible Environments**: Theatrical stage-like spaces defying perspective logic - 70-80% architecturally impossible spatial relationships with interior/exterior boundaries dissolved
3. **Archetypal Ceremonial Groupings**: Multiple figures arranged in ritual scenarios - 80-90% symbolic positioning rather than naturalistic human interaction within mysterious ceremony contexts
4. **Muted Earth-Tone Atmospheric Integration**: Desaturated palette (70-80% muted saturation) dominated by ochres, umbers, earth tones with selective bright accents (10-20% composition) for symbolic emphasis
5. **Timeless Symbolic Clothing**: Simple, archetypal garments existing outside historical periods - robes, tunics, basic shapes (90% simplified forms) serving symbolic rather than fashion function

**Tone Tag**: Metamorphically transformative, spatially impossible, archetypally symbolic, atmospherically mysterious, theatrically ceremonial.

**Innovation Line**: Tempera precision technique applied to metamorphic surrealism enabling systematic impossible transformation visualization through spatial impossibility and archetypal symbolic integration within theatrical dream-stages.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS**:

- **For Portrait Ratios (3:4, 4:5)**: Metamorphic figure dominance ≥70% with impossible spatial environment integration, archetypal transformation emphasis through vertical format supporting ceremonial narrative
- **For Landscape Ratios (4:3, 5:3, 16:9)**: Spatially impossible environmental context ≥50%, theatrical staging distribution across horizontal space following dream-stage logic rather than realistic perspective
- **For Square (1:1)**: Central archetypal focus with balanced impossible element distribution, equal weight between metamorphic figure and spatially impossible environmental context

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION**:

- **Perspective Regime**: Impossible spatial organization defying realistic perspective while maintaining tempera precision. Theatrical staging principles creating dream-environments supporting archetypal narrative rather than naturalistic space.
- **Grid/Symmetry**: Ceremonial arrangement following symbolic narrative logic rather than realistic spatial organization. Archetypal positioning emphasizing ritual function over naturalistic gesture.
- **Figure:Ground %**: Archetypal figures 60-70%, spatially impossible environmental context 30-40%, atmospheric areas supporting symbolic narrative - every surface carrying transformation significance through tempera precision
- **Density %**: Moderate symbolic density supporting archetypal clarity - 60-70% detailed content with atmospheric integration allowing ceremonial contemplation rather than decorative oversaturation
- **Lighting Logic**: Impossible atmospheric lighting creating symbolic mood through multiple inconsistent sources. Tempera precision applied to lighting that supports archetypal narrative rather than realistic illumination.
- **Detail:Negative Space Ratio**: Balanced archetypal relationship supporting symbolic storytelling - atmospheric depth allowing ceremonial engagement with metamorphic elements integrated through tempera precision

**REQUIRED ANCHORS**:

- **Surface Context**: Tempera and oil on wood panels/canvas with smooth gesso preparation and enamel-like precision characteristics requiring intimate symbolic viewing engagement
- **Frame/Band Anchor**: No external frames - composition exists within canvas boundaries following archetypal presentation conventions
- **Production Context**: 1937-2011 British-Mexican exile studio methods with authentic tempera technique research and metamorphic symbolic practice integration
- **Ratio Enforcement**: Composition designed specifically for declared aspect ratio with impossible spatial narrative elements following theatrical staging principles rather than realistic architectural organization

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary**: Omit entirely - Carrington's metamorphic surrealism emphasized pure archetypal visual transformation without text integration

**Text Policy**: No typography permitted. All metamorphic and symbolic content communicated through visual transformation and impossible spatial integration. Any text elements would violate authentic Carrington aesthetic approach focusing on archetypal visual language and symbolic storytelling through tempera precision alone.

**Historical Accuracy**: Carrington's gallery works excluded text integration - maintained metamorphic surrealist art purity through visual archetypal communication exclusively. Symbolic transformation and impossible spatial content transmitted through tempera technique, metamorphic integration, and theatrical staging rather than written language.
