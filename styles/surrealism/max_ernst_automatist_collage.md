# Max Ernst

**Version:** 4.2 (Ernst Specialized) **Artist Period:** 1919-1976 (Peak Dada: 1919-1922; Classic Surrealism: 1925-1940; American Exile: 1941-1953) **Primary Technique:** Collage-Inspired Surrealism via Automatist Methods (Frottage, Grattage, Decalcomania)

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via collage transformation and fantastic metamorphosis; recognizable through metamorphic possibilities.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("3-5mm grattage depth", "80% texture coverage", "pencil pressure 2-3 pounds per square inch") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Automatist technique sequences (frottage→interpretation→grattage layering) supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** Ernst-specific automatist transformations permitted when standard surrealist options fail authenticity requirements.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate disturbing metamorphic imagery when historically accurate to post-WWI trauma processing.

### **Ernst-Specific Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**

- `collage-metamorphic-transformation`: Recognizable features combined with fantastic creature elements from scientific illustrations
- `frottage-texture-revelation`: Facial features emerging from rubbed surface textures with organic interpretation
- `grattage-excavated-portrait`: Portrait revealed through scraping layers over textured objects
- `decalcomania-organic-emergence`: Features formed from pressed paint patterns interpreted as metamorphic beings
- `scientific-illustration-hybrid`: Human features combined with botanical/zoological elements from period textbooks

### **Ernst-Specific Pose Flags (choose one):**

- `fantastic-creature-integration`: Figure merged with chimeric beings and metamorphic animals
- `collage-disjunctive-positioning`: Classical poses disrupted by cut-and-paste visual logic
- `automatist-unconscious-gesture`: Positioning determined by texture-revealed unconscious associations
- `scientific-specimen-presentation`: Figure displayed with natural history illustration conventions

- `strict-reframe-metamorphic`: Recompose entirely for fantastic creature integration
- `collage-logic-extension`: Extend background following cut-and-paste disjunctive principles
- `texture-automatic-adaptation`: Canvas adaptation following automatist technique discovery process

### **Missing Renderer-Agnostic Guardrails**:

- **Media Hybrid Flag (optional)**: `photo-illustration-collage`, `vector-screenprint`, `cutout-montage`
- **Material Physics Authority**: Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences
- **Scale-Dependent Technique**: Viewing distance requirements affect brushwork precision and detail hierarchy
- **Cultural Production Authenticity**: Indigenous and traditional methods take precedence over modern interpretations
- **Quantifiers authoritative**: numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy**: Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP**: No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail**: Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral
- **Gender expression**: Respect presented
- **Material authenticity**: No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics
- **Period Production Authenticity**: For historical publication styles (comics, magazines, prints), use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection
- **Composition boundaries**: No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits
- **Failure Mode Flags**: Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.)
- **Silent validation**: Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- `4:3` (landscape for forest environments and apocalyptic vistas)
- `3:4` (portrait for metamorphic creature studies)
- `1:1` (square for collage-logic compositions)
- `5:3` (panoramic for "Europe After the Rain" scale devastation)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method**: extend-background with fantastic forest environments or apocalyptic landscapes following collage disjunctive logic
- **Spatial Allocation**: Subject placement according to automatist discovery process rather than classical composition
- **Background Treatment**: Layered texture creation through grattage/frottage techniques with conscious interpretation overlay
- **Format Justification**: Canvas ratio optimized for Ernst's collage-inspired disjunctive narrative and metamorphic creature integration

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Medium/Production Method**: Oil on canvas with innovative automatist preparation methods. Canvas prepared with textured objects beneath for grattage effects. Mixed media integration including collage elements from scientific illustrations, ethnographic photographs, and commercial catalogs. Frottage texture foundation with conscious painterly interpretation layer.

**Thematic Purpose**: Processing WWI trauma through fantastic metamorphosis; exploration of unconscious imagery via automatist techniques; critique of rational civilization through collage disruption of logical relationships. Transformation of found imagery into psychological landscapes.

**Period Framing**: European avant-garde (1920s-1970s) with specific focus on post-WWI Dada nihilism transitioning to Surrealist psychological exploration. American exile period introducing oscillation techniques influencing Abstract Expressionism.

**5 Hallmark Motifs with Quantified Specifications**:

1. **Fantastic Metamorphic Creatures**: Human-animal-machine hybrids with 60-70% recognizable elements combined with 30-40% fantastic transformation
2. **Dense Forest Environments**: Threatening woodland settings with 80-90% texture coverage created through grattage technique
3. **Collage-Logic Juxtapositions**: Disjunctive combinations of 2-3 unrelated source materials creating "spark of poetry"
4. **Scientific Illustration Appropriation**: Elements from botanical/zoological/ethnographic sources integrated with 70-80% accuracy to original proportions
5. **Automatist Texture Revelation**: Surface patterns created through chance techniques (frottage/grattage/decalcomania) with conscious interpretation overlay

**Tone Tag**: Post-war psychological excavation, fantastic metamorphosis, collage-disrupted reality, automatist discovery process.

**Innovation Line**: Automatist techniques (frottage, grattage, decalcomania, oscillation) enabling systematic bypass of conscious control to access unconscious imagery.

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Anchors with Measurement Specifications**:

**Line Quality & Tool Marks**: Mixed technique application - precise collage edges combined with organic automatist textures. Frottage areas show pencil pressure marks (2-3 pounds per square inch). Grattage reveals show scraping tool marks with 3-5mm depth variation. Clean collage element integration with seamless edge treatment.

**Automatist Technique Sequences**:

- **Frottage Foundation**: Pencil rubbing over textured surfaces (wood grain, leaves, fabric) covering 40-60% of canvas area
- **Conscious Interpretation Layer**: Oil paint application interpreting discovered textures into fantastic creatures and environments
- **Grattage Texture Creation**: Scraping wet paint over objects placed beneath canvas, revealing impressed patterns covering 30-50% of surface
- **Decalcomania Organic Patterns**: Pressed paint transfer creating unpredictable organic forms in 20-30% of composition

**Texture Thickness Specifications**: Varied application - thin glazes over automatist areas (1-2mm), standard oil paint application (3-4mm), textured grattage areas with pronounced surface relief (5-8mm variation).

**Edge Treatment**: Sharp collage element boundaries combined with organic automatist edges. No lost edges in collage areas - maintains cut-and-paste visual logic. Automatist areas feature organic, unpredictable edge relationships.

**Detail Hierarchy with Proportional Specifications**:

- Collage elements: 100% sharp focus maintaining source material clarity
- Automatist interpretations: 85% detail with organic texture emphasis
- Background environments: 70% detail allowing texture prominence
- Metamorphic transitions: 90% precision in creature transformation logic

**Material Simulation with Authentic Characteristics**: Collage elements maintain source material surface characteristics (paper texture, printing dot patterns, photographic grain). Automatist areas exhibit authentic technique surface quality - frottage pencil sheen, grattage scrape marks, decalcomania organic irregularities.

**Pose Anchors**:

- Metamorphic integration: 60-70% human proportion maintained within fantastic creature transformation
- Collage positioning: Disjunctive placement following dream-logic rather than gravitational laws
- Forest absorption: Figure integration with environment at 40-50% boundary dissolution
- Scientific specimen display: Formal presentation conventions from natural history illustrations

**Scale Hierarchy**: Proportional relationships follow collage-logic disruption - elements may be dramatically rescaled (150-300% enlargements, 25-50% reductions) to create disjunctive "spark of poetry."

**Material Authenticity**: Authentic mixed media surface characteristics combining oil paint with period-appropriate collage materials. Automatist texture techniques must show genuine chance-based irregularities, not digitally simulated effects.

**Period Consistency**: All collage source materials authentic to 1920s-1970s European/American published materials (scientific textbooks, ethnographic journals, commercial catalogs). Technique methods documented from Ernst studio practice.

**Canvas Adaptation**: Composition designed specifically for declared aspect ratio with automatist discovery process determining final layout rather than predetermined design.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks**:

- **Metamorphic Integration**: Contemporary 1920s-1970s fashion combined with fantastic creature elements (feathers, scales, mechanical components)
- **Scientific Specimen**: Clothing presented with natural history illustration conventions - labels, measurement marks, specimen display logic
- **Collage Disruption**: Garments cut and combined from disparate source materials following collage juxtaposition principles

**Fabric Behavior**: Materials subject to fantastic transformation - cloth may become organic tissue, mechanical components, or hybrid textures. Collage elements maintain source material properties while integrated into impossible combinations.

**Accessory Caps**: Moderate integration (2-3 accessories) - each accessory carrying metamorphic potential or scientific illustration significance.

**Color Palette Restrictions**: Earth tones dominated palette (ochres, umbers, forest greens, geological grays) with selective bright accent colors from collage source materials. All pigments authentic to historical period with documented availability.

**Wardrobe Variation Required**: Primary garment treatment cycles through metamorphic possibilities - avoid identical transformation approaches. Each iteration requires different creature integration (avian, reptilian, mechanical, botanical).

**Props**:

- **1 Hero Prop**: Selected from scientific illustration sources (botanical specimens, geological samples, ethnographic objects, mechanical devices)
- **Optional 1 Micro Prop**: Small metamorphic elements bridging human and creature realms

**YAML Prop Pools**:

```yaml
metamorphic_elements:
  - bird_hybrid_features: "wings, beaks, talons integrated with human anatomy"
  - botanical_specimens: "scientific illustration plants becoming creature components"
  - geological_formations: "rock and crystal elements merged with organic forms"
  - mechanical_hybrids: "industrial components fused with biological structures"
  - ethnographic_objects: "non-Western cultural artifacts in fantastic contexts"
  - forest_creatures: "threatening woodland animals in metamorphic states"

scientific_props:
  - specimen_containers: "glass vessels containing impossible specimens"
  - measurement_devices: "calipers, scales, scientific instruments"
  - classification_systems: "taxonomic charts and specimen labels"
  - exploration_equipment: "field research tools in surreal contexts"
```

**Coherence Filter**: All wardrobe and prop elements support 1920s-1970s European/American context with authentic period source materials. Fallback to simple metamorphic integration if anachronistic elements detected.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS**:

- **For Portrait Ratios (3:4, 4:5)**: Metamorphic creature dominance ≥70% with fantastic environment integration, disjunctive collage-logic hierarchy
- **For Landscape Ratios (4:3, 5:3, 16:9)**: Forest environment or apocalyptic landscape context ≥50%, automatist texture distribution across horizontal space
- **For Square (1:1)**: Central metamorphic focus with radial collage element distribution, equal weight between creature and environment transformation

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION**:

- **Perspective Regime**: Disjunctive space following collage-logic rather than Renaissance perspective. Multiple spatial systems combined within single composition.
- **Grid/Symmetry**: Anti-symmetrical arrangement following automatist discovery process and unconscious association logic
- **Figure:Ground %**: Metamorphic creature 50-60%, fantastic environment 40-50%, no neutral areas - every surface carries transformative content
- **Density %**: High texture density through automatist techniques - 70-80% of surface showing frottage, grattage, or decalcomania effects
- **Lighting Logic**: Multiple light sources following collage-logic rather than single source consistency. Each collage element maintains original lighting conditions.
- **Detail:Negative Space Ratio**: Minimal negative space - every area populated with metamorphic content or automatist texture discovery optimized for declared ratio

**REQUIRED ANCHORS**:

- **Surface Context**: Mixed media on canvas with authentic automatist technique application and period-appropriate collage material integration
- **Frame/Band Anchor**: No external frames - composition exists within canvas boundaries with possible collage element extension to edges
- **Production Context**: 1920s-1970s European/American avant-garde studio methods with documented automatist techniques and authentic source materials
- **Ratio Enforcement**: Composition designed specifically for declared aspect ratio with automatist discovery process determining spatial distribution

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary**: Selective integration permitted when authentic to collage source materials

**Text Policy**: Typography only permitted when sourced from authentic period materials (scientific illustration labels, book fragments, catalog text). No contemporary typography. Text integration must follow collage-logic disruption rather than readable communication.

**If Typography Permitted**:

- **Source Material Authenticity**: Only 1920s-1970s printed matter (scientific textbooks, catalogs, journals)
- **Collage Integration**: Text fragments cut and repositioned following disjunctive logic
- **Partial Obscuration**: Text elements 30-60% obscured by paint application or metamorphic integration
- **Multiple Language**: German, French, English period sources combined disjunctively
- **Scientific Convention**: Specimen labels, taxonomic classifications, measurement annotations when contextually appropriate

**Period Typography Restrictions**: Only letterpress, hot metal typesetting, and period-appropriate printing methods. No modern digital typography or contemporary font designs.

**Historical Accuracy**: All text elements must derive from documented Ernst source materials or period-equivalent publications with authentic printing characteristics.
