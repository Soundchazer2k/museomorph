# René Magritte

**Version:** 4.2 (Magritte Specialized) **Artist Period:** 1926-1967 (Peak Conceptual Period: 1929-1940; Mature Period: 1949-1967) **Primary Technique:** Conceptual Surrealism via Commercial Illustration Precision and Philosophical Inquiry

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via conceptual transformation and philosophical questioning; recognizable through impossible scenarios rendered with commercial precision.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("invisible brushwork 0mm texture", "flat finish 1-2mm thickness", "bowler hat 95mm diameter") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Commercial illustration technique (flat application→invisible brushwork→conceptual impossibility integration) supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** Magritte-specific conceptual transformations permitted when standard surrealist options fail authenticity requirements.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate philosophically disturbing or logically impossible imagery when historically accurate to conceptual inquiry method.

### **Magritte-Specific Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**

- `commercial-illustration-precision`: Photographic accuracy with invisible brushwork, commercial advertisement clarity
- `conceptual-obscuration-apple`: Face concealed by floating green apple maintaining perfect realistic rendering
- `conceptual-obscuration-shroud`: Face covered by draped fabric with material physics accuracy
- `conceptual-fragmentation-geometric`: Face divided or duplicated following impossible logic with seamless technical execution
- `bowler-hat-everyman-anonymous`: Generic bourgeois features beneath signature bowler hat, emphasizing anonymous middle-class uniformity

### **Magritte-Specific Pose Flags (choose one):**

- `bourgeois-formal-positioning`: Classical contrapposto stance in business suit within impossible conceptual context
- `conceptual-impossibility-calm`: Ordinary positioning despite extraordinary circumstances, maintaining matter-of-fact composure
- `everyman-anonymous-stance`: Generic middle-class posture emphasizing conformity and social invisibility

### **Missing Renderer-Agnostic Guardrails**:

- **Media Hybrid Flag (optional)**: `photo-illustration-collage`, `vector-screenprint`, `cutout-montage`
- **Material Physics Authority**: Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences
- **Scale-Dependent Technique**: Viewing distance requirements affect brushwork precision and detail hierarchy
- **Cultural Production Authenticity**: Indigenous and traditional methods take precedence over modern interpretations
- **Quantifiers authoritative**: numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy**: Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP**: No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail**: Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral
- **Gender expression**: Respect presented
- **Material authenticity**: No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Medium/Production Method**: Oil on canvas with commercial illustration preparation methods. Canvas prepared with smooth gesso surface. Oil paints applied in thin, controlled layers achieving invisible brushwork. Fat-over-lean technique with completely smooth surface finish. No visible texture or impasto - surface quality comparable to commercial advertisement illustration.

**Thematic Purpose**: Questioning the relationship between images, words, and reality; exposing the arbitrary nature of representation; challenging preconditioned perceptions through visual philosophy; making ordinary objects mysterious through displacement and impossible juxtaposition.

**Period Framing**: Belgian Surrealism (1920s-1960s) with specific focus on conceptual period questioning perception and reality. Commercial art background influencing fine art technique with advertising precision applied to philosophical content.

**5 Hallmark Motifs with Quantified Specifications**:

1. **Bowler Hat Everyman**: Anonymous middle-class figures in business suits - 90% generic bourgeois accuracy, 95mm diameter bowler hats, complete facial anonymity emphasis
2. **Face Obscuration Techniques**: Green apples, fabric shrouds, geometric displacement - 80-90% face concealment while maintaining human recognizability
3. **Impossible Scale Relationships**: Objects dramatically enlarged or miniaturized - 200-500% scale distortions of ordinary items within realistic rendering
4. **Material Physics Impossibilities**: Solid objects rendered as transparent, heavy items floating, impossible transformations - 100% technical accuracy applied to impossible scenarios
5. **Commercial Illustration Precision**: Every surface rendered with advertising-quality clarity - 100% material accuracy (fabric texture, metal reflection, organic matter detail)

**Tone Tag**: Conceptually mysterious, philosophically questioning, matter-of-factly surreal, bourgeois-ordinary-made-extraordinary.

**Innovation Line**: Commercial illustration technique precision applied to philosophical inquiry enabling systematic visual questioning of reality and perception through impossible scenarios rendered with advertising clarity.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks**:

- **Bourgeois Business Formal**: Conservative 1920s-1960s European business suits, bowler hats, white shirts, conservative ties rendered with commercial illustration precision
- **Anonymous Middle-Class**: Generic contemporary professional attire emphasizing social conformity and individual invisibility
- **Period-Appropriate Feminine**: Conservative 1920s-1960s women's fashion when appropriate to subject, avoiding decoration that disrupts conceptual focus
- **Everyman Uniformity**: Clothing as social uniform rather than individual expression, emphasizing generic bourgeois conformity

**Fabric Behavior**: All textiles rendered with commercial illustration accuracy showing authentic material physics. Business suit wool displaying proper drape and sheen. Cotton shirts showing authentic weave characteristics. All clothing maintaining period-appropriate construction and fit.

**Accessory Caps**: Minimal integration (1-2 accessories maximum) - bowler hats essential, occasional umbrellas, pipes, or generic bourgeois accessories carrying conceptual rather than decorative significance.

**Color Palette Restrictions**: Muted commercial palette dominated by grays, navy blues, earth tones, conservative colors. Limited bright accents (red ties, green apples) used strategically for conceptual emphasis. All colors authentic to commercial illustration standards and period accuracy.

**Wardrobe Variation Required**: Primary garment treatment cycles through bourgeois professional variations - avoid identical business suit presentations. Each iteration requires different conservative professional styling while maintaining anonymous middle-class uniformity.

**Props**:

- **1 Hero Prop**: Selected from documented Magritte iconography (green apple, bowler hat, umbrella, pipe, mirror, book, architectural element)
- **Optional 1 Micro Prop**: Small conceptual elements (keys, birds, clouds, geometric shapes) integrated for philosophical inquiry

**YAML Prop Pools**:

```yaml
conceptual_elements:
  - green_apple: "crisp perfect apple used for face obscuration or impossible placement"
  - bowler_hat: "95mm diameter anonymous middle-class uniform headwear"
  - black_umbrella: "bourgeois weather protection tool in impossible contexts"
