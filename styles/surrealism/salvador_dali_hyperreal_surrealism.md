# Salvador Dalí

**Version:** 4.2 (Dalí Specialized) **Artist Period:** 1929-1989 (Peak Surrealist: 1929-1940; Nuclear Mysticism: 1950s-1980s) **Primary Technique:** Hyperrealistic Surrealism via Paranoiac-Critical Method

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

  - **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
  - **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
  - **Style over likeness:** Likeness via hyperrealistic precision within dreamlike distortion; photographic accuracy applied to impossible scenarios.
  - **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("3-5mm impasto thickness", "invisible brushwork", "150% neck elongation") override descriptive language.
  - **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Oil-over-lean layering technique, linseed oil mixing ratios, Renaissance preparation methods supersede visual appearance descriptions.
  - **Custom Flag Authorization:** Dalí-specific paranoid-critical transformations permitted when standard surrealist options fail authenticity requirements.
  - **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate psychologically disturbing or melting imagery when historically accurate to paranoiac-critical method.

  ### **Dalí-Specific Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**

  - `oil-fat-over-lean-hyperreal`: Renaissance-level precision with extended drying time for seamless blending
  - `paranoiac-critical-distortion`: Photographically accurate features subject to dream-logic transformation
  - `melting-temporal-dissolution`: Time-fluid facial features maintaining recognizable identity through liquefaction
  - `double-image-metamorphosis`: Single face readable as multiple subjects simultaneously
  - `psychological-revelation-hyperreal`: Unconscious fears/desires manifested through precise symbolic integration

  ### **Dalí-Specific Pose Flags (choose one):**

  - `classical-dignity-surreal-context`: Renaissance contrapposto within impossible dreamscapes
  - `paranoiac-critical-positioning`: Figure placement determined by unconscious association logic
  - `melting-temporal-pose`: Classical positioning subject to time-dissolution effects
  - `symbolic-gesture-integration`: Hand/body positions incorporating personal iconography (crutches, keys, etc.)
  - `catalan-landscape-integration`: Figure harmonized with Mediterranean coastal environments

  ### **Dalí Canvas Control Flags (choose one):**

  - `strict-reframe-dreamscape`: Recompose entirely for surreal landscape integration
  - `hyperreal-extend-background`: Extend Catalonian/Mediterranean elements with photographic precision
  - `paranoiac-critical-adaptation`: Canvas adaptation following unconscious association logic

  ### **Missing Renderer-Agnostic Guardrails**:

  - **Media Hybrid Flag (optional)**: `photo-illustration-collage`, `vector-screenprint`, `cutout-montage`
  - **Material Physics Authority**: Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences
  - **Scale-Dependent Technique**: Viewing distance requirements affect brushwork precision and detail hierarchy
  - **Cultural Production Authenticity**: Indigenous and traditional methods take precedence over modern interpretations
  - **Quantifiers authoritative**: numeric anchors are targets
  - **Text policy**: Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
  - **Safety/IP**: No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures
  - **Age & wardrobe guardrail**: Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral
  - **Gender expression**: Respect presented
  - **Material authenticity**: No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics
  - **Period Production Authenticity**: For historical publication styles (comics, magazines, prints), use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection
  - **Composition boundaries**: No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits
  - **Failure Mode Flags**: Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.)
  - **Silent validation**: Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- `4:3` (classical landscape for Catalonian dreamscapes)
- `3:4` (portrait for psychological studies)
- `4:5` (Instagram format adapted for modern surreal portraiture)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method**: extend-background with Mediterranean/Catalonian landscape elements
- **Spatial Allocation**: Subject placement according to Renaissance golden ratio within surreal context
- **Background Treatment**: Seamless extension of hyperrealistic dream environments with atmospheric perspective
- **Format Justification**: Canvas ratio optimized for Dalí's classical composition within surreal narrative structure

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Medium/Production Method**: Oil on canvas with Renaissance-level technical precision using classical preparation methods. Canvas primed with traditional gesso; oil paints mixed with linseed oil for extended workability (2-3 week drying time between layers). Fat-over-lean technique with invisible brushwork achieving photographic surface quality.

**Thematic Purpose**: Exploration of unconscious mind through Freudian psychoanalysis rendered with hyperrealistic precision. Transformation of rational reality through paranoiac-critical method revealing hidden psychological associations.

**Period Framing**: European Surrealism (1920s-1980s) with specific focus on Catalonian cultural elements and Mediterranean environment. Peak technical period emphasizing "hand-painted dream photographs."

**5 Hallmark Motifs with Quantified Specifications**:

1. **Melting/Soft Objects**: Timepieces, organic forms liquefied while maintaining structural recognition - 30-40% form retention
2. **Impossible Perspectives**: Classical Renaissance perspective applied to dream logic - single-point perspective with multiple horizon lines
3. **Symbolic Integration**: Personal iconography (ants=death, eggs=hope, crutches=support) - 2-3 symbols maximum per composition
4. **Hyperrealistic Precision**: Photographic accuracy in impossible scenarios - every surface rendered with scientific illustration detail
5. **Catalonian Landscapes**: Mediterranean coastal elements with golden light - specific reference to Port Lligat geography

**Tone Tag**: Dreamlike precision, psychological revelation, classical technique applied to irrational content.

**Innovation Line**: Paranoiac-critical method enabling systematic access to unconscious imagery through controlled paranoid states.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Anchors with Measurement Specifications**:

**Line Quality & Tool Marks**: Invisible brushwork achieved through multiple glazing layers. Individual brush strokes completely eliminated through wet-blending technique. Surface smoothness comparable to Renaissance masters (Meissonier precision level).

**Color Mixing Methods**: Oil paints mixed with linseed oil in 3:1 ratio for extended working time. Colors built through transparent glazes over detailed underpainting. No impasto texture - completely smooth surface finish.

**Texture Thickness Specifications**: Paint layer thickness 2-3mm maximum. No visible brush texture. Surface achieves porcelain-like smoothness through multiple glazing applications.

**Edge Treatment**: Edges rendered with scientific illustration precision. No lost edges - every form maintains clear delineation even within soft/melting transformations.

**Detail Hierarchy with Proportional Specifications**:

- Primary subject: 100% photographic detail
- Secondary elements: 85% detail level
- Background: 70% detail but atmospheric perspective maintained
- Symbolic elements: 100% precision regardless of scale

**Material Simulation with Authentic Characteristics**: Every surface (fabric, metal, organic matter, landscape) rendered with material-specific light behavior. Reflection, refraction, and subsurface scattering calculated for photographic accuracy.

**Pose Anchors**:

- Head tilt: Classical contrapposto angles (15-20 degrees from vertical)
- Shoulder-hip differential: Renaissance proportion standards
- Weight distribution: 60/40 classical stance adapted to surreal ground plane
- Gesture economy: Maximum 2 symbolic gestures integrated naturally

**Scale Hierarchy**: Proportional relationships follow Renaissance standards unless specifically distorted for psychological effect (elongations measured as percentages: neck elongation 150%, limb extensions 120-180%).

**Material Authenticity**: Authentic oil painting surface characteristics - no digital simulation. Paint behavior must follow physical properties of oil medium including drying crack patterns and aging characteristics.

**Period Consistency**: All technical methods documented from 1929-1980 Dalí studio practice. No techniques unavailable during historical period.

**Canvas Adaptation**: Composition specifically designed for declared aspect ratio with background elements extending naturally to fill frame without cropping or distortion.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks**:

- **Adult Contemporary (1920s-1950s)**: Bourgeois European fashion rendered with fabric-specific precision
- **Classical Drapery**: Renaissance-inspired flowing materials subject to dream transformations
- **Modern Catalonian**: Regional Spanish elements integrated with contemporary fashion

**Fabric Behavior**: All textiles rendered with material physics accuracy. Silk shows light refraction, wool displays fiber texture, cotton exhibits absorption characteristics. Fabric drape follows gravitational laws even within surreal contexts.

**Accessory Caps**: Minimalist approach (0-2 accessories) - each accessory carrying symbolic weight from Dalí's personal iconography.

**Color Palette Restrictions**: Mediterranean color relationships - golden yellows, azure blues, burnt siennas, titanium whites. All pigments available in historical period with authentic color mixing limitations.

**Wardrobe Variation Required**: Primary garment colors cycle through Catalonian palette - avoid repetition across iterations. Each iteration requires different textile treatment (silk vs. cotton vs. wool).

**Props**:

- **1 Hero Prop**: Selected from authentic Dalí iconography (melting clock, crutch, key, drawer, egg, bread)
- **Optional 1 Micro Prop**: Ants, butterflies, small symbolic elements integrated organically

**YAML Prop Pools**:

```yaml
primary_symbols:
  - melting_timepiece: "pocket watch or clock in liquid state"
  - wooden_crutch: "supporting impossible architectural elements"
  - golden_key: "unlocking unconscious revelations"
  - chest_drawers: "opening from human torso revealing hidden contents"
  - perfect_egg: "symbol of hope and resurrection"
  - catalan_bread: "everyday sustenance rendered with religious significance"

micro_elements:
  - black_ants: "crawling across surfaces indicating decay"
  - blue_butterflies: "metamorphosis and psychological transformation" 
  - olive_branch: "Mediterranean peace within psychological turbulence"
```

**Coherence Filter**: All wardrobe and prop elements must support 1929-1980 European context with authentic historical accuracy. Fallback to clean, classical presentation if anachronistic elements detected.

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**Canvas Negatives (≥2)**:

- ❌ "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "unmodified framing"
- ❌ "loose brushwork", "impressionistic technique", "visible paint texture"
- ❌ "abstract imagery", "non-representational elements", "pure color fields"
- ❌ "modern digital effects", "HDR processing", "artificial sharpening"

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS**:

- **For Portrait Ratios (3:4, 4:5)**: Subject dominance ≥70% with psychological landscape integration, classical Renaissance hierarchy adapted to surreal narrative
- **For Landscape Ratios (4:3, 16:9)**: Catalonian coastline environmental context ≥40%, panoramic surreal landscape with multiple symbolic elements distributed according to golden ratio
- **For Square (1:1)**: Central psychological focus with radial symbolic distribution, equal weight between figure and environment

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION**:

- **Perspective Regime**: Single-point Renaissance perspective maintained even within impossible spatial relationships. Multiple horizon lines permitted for dream logic but mathematically consistent within each spatial zone.
- **Grid/Symmetry**: Golden ratio proportional system with classical Renaissance symmetry adapted to psychological content
- **Figure:Ground %**: Subject figure 60-70%, symbolic landscape 30-40%, no areas without psychological content
- **Density %**: High detail density throughout - no areas of visual rest; every surface carries symbolic or narrative weight
- **Lighting Logic**: Classical Renaissance chiaroscuro with Mediterranean golden hour quality. Single light source with scientifically accurate shadow behavior even within surreal contexts.
- **Detail:Negative Space Ratio**: Minimal negative space - every area populated with hyperrealistic detail optimized for declared ratio viewing distance

**REQUIRED ANCHORS**:

- **Surface Context**: Oil on canvas with museum-quality preparation and presentation. Canvas texture completely eliminated through ground preparation.
- **Frame/Band Anchor**: No external frames - composition exists within canvas boundaries exclusively
- **Production Context**: 1929-1980 European studio methods with authentic materials and documented techniques
- **Ratio Enforcement**: Composition designed specifically for declared aspect ratio with natural background extension, never cropped or adapted from different format

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary**: Omit entirely - Dalí's surrealism emphasized pure visual expression without text integration

**Text Policy**: No typography permitted. All narrative content communicated through visual symbolism and hyperrealistic imagery. Any text elements would violate authentic Dalí aesthetic approach.

**Historical Accuracy**: Dalí's gallery works excluded text integration - maintained fine art purity through visual communication exclusively.

------

## Dalí-Specific Guardrails

### **Paranoiac-Critical Method Implementation**:

- All compositional decisions must follow dream logic rather than rational spatial relationships
- Symbolic elements appear through unconscious association, not planned placement
- Double images and optical illusions encouraged when historically accurate
- Reality distortions must maintain hyperrealistic surface treatment

### **Technical Authentication**:

- Paint handling must reflect 1929-1980 studio documentation
- No brushwork visible under magnification
- Color mixing limited to pigments available during historical period
- Surface quality comparable to scientific illustration precision

### **Symbolic Vocabulary Restrictions**:

- Only documented Dalí iconography permitted (ants, clocks, crutches, eggs, keys, drawers, elephants, bread)
- Personal trauma symbols integrated organically, not forced
- Mediterranean cultural elements authentic to Catalonian context
- Freudian psychological content rendered through visual metaphor

### **Period Consistency Requirements**:

- All fashion, architecture, and cultural elements authentic to 1920s-1980s Europe
- No anachronistic objects or styling
- Lighting conditions consistent with Mediterranean environment
- Landscape elements specific to Catalonian geography (Port Lligat, Cadaqués coastline)
