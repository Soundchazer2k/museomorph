------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via mystical transformation and alchemical symbolism; spiritually idealized through symbolic integration.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("1-2 bristle brush modification", "mother-of-pearl 0.5mm thickness", "incising depth 0.2-0.3mm") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Alchemical technique sequences (incising→oil application→graffito detailing→luminous glazing) supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** Varo-specific mystical transformations permitted when standard surrealist options fail authenticity requirements.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate challenging mystical imagery when historically accurate to spiritual quest themes.

### **Varo-Specific Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**

- `mystical-unadorned-precision`: Clean, contemplative features with large eyes, no decorative elements, subtle elongation (110-130% vertical proportion)
- `mother-of-pearl-enlightened`: Reserved for 4 figures maximum - embedded iridescent material flush with gesso surface, not surface decoration
- `incised-foundation-luminosity`: Spiritual glow achieved through technique (incising + oil absorption + glazing) never through added ornaments
- `androgynous-seeker-features`: Gender-neutral or feminine features only - masculine interpretations historically inaccurate
- `contemplative-large-eyes`: Oversized eyes (120-140% normal proportion) conveying spiritual depth without decorative enhancement

### **Varo-Specific Pose Flags (choose one):**

- `mystical-seeker-positioning`: Solitary figure on spiritual quest within alchemical laboratory or tower setting
- `alchemical-practice-gesture`: Precise hand positioning for magical apparatus operation or mystical substance manipulation

### **Missing Renderer-Agnostic Guardrails**:

- **Media Hybrid Flag (optional)**: `mystical-mixed-media`, `alchemical-inlay-integration`, `spiritual-material-fusion`
- **Material Physics Authority**: Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences
- **Scale-Dependent Technique**: Viewing distance requirements affect brushwork precision and detail hierarchy
- **Cultural Production Authenticity**: Indigenous and traditional methods take precedence over modern interpretations
- **Quantifiers authoritative**: numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy**: Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP**: No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail**: Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral
- **Gender expression**: Respect presented
- **Material authenticity**: No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics
- **Period Production Authenticity**: For historical publication styles (comics, magazines, prints), use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection
- **Composition boundaries**: No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits
- **Failure Mode Flags**: Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.)
- **Silent validation**: Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Medium/Production Method**: Oil on Masonite hardboard with meticulous multi-layered preparation. Gesso ground prepared with incising network using quartz crystals possibly charged by moonlight. Modified brushes with 1-2 bristles remaining for extraordinary precision. Selective mother-of-pearl inlay (0.5mm thickness) reserved for spiritually enlightened figures. Graffito detailing using sewing needles of various sizes.

**Thematic Purpose**: Mapping the soul's initiatory journey (viaje iniciático) toward spiritual enlightenment; feminine mysticism challenging patriarchal authority; alchemical transformation as metaphor for psychological integration; synthesis of science and magic through precision and wonder.

**Period Framing**: Mexican Surrealist exile period (1941-1963) with specific focus on mature mystical work (1955-1963). European esoteric tradition synthesis with Mexican cultural integration and feminine spiritual authority reclamation.

**5 Hallmark Motifs with Quantified Specifications**:

1. **Mystical Tower Laboratories**: Architectural spaces containing alchemical apparatus - 70-80% interior detail precision with scientific instrument accuracy
2. **Solitary Mystical Seekers**: Elongated figures (120-150% normal proportions) with owl-like or hybrid creature characteristics, 90% recognizably human
3. **Alchemical Apparatus Integration**: Intricate mystical machines processing invisible forces - 100% mechanical precision with impossible function
4. **Weaving and Thread Symbolism**: Figures creating reality through textile manipulation - 60-70% of composition involving creative transformation
5. **Birds and Flight Imagery**: Symbols of spiritual transcendence and creative power - 80-90% naturalistic accuracy within mystical context integration

**Tone Tag**: Mystical precision, feminine spiritual authority, alchemical transformation, initiatory quest journey.

**Innovation Line**: Alchemical technique synthesis (incising, graffito, controlled decalcomania, mother-of-pearl inlay) enabling systematic spiritual visualization through material precision.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Anchors with Measurement Specifications**:

**Line Quality & Tool Marks**: Modified brush technique with 1-2 bristles remaining creating extraordinary linear precision. Graffito detailing using sewing needles producing 0.1-0.2mm line width. Incising foundation creating preferential oil absorption patterns with 0.2-0.3mm depth. All tool marks serve spiritual visualization purpose.

**Alchemical Technique Sequences**:

- **Incising Foundation**: Fine shallow scratches covering 40-60% of gesso ground using quartz crystals, creating texture network that preferentially absorbs oil paint
- **Controlled Decalcomania**: Planned organic texture creation for specific elements (rocky surfaces, tree foliage, atmospheric effects) covering 20-30% of composition
- **Oil Paint Application**: Traditional fat-over-lean technique with transparent glazing layers building luminous depth
- **Graffito Detailing**: Needle-scratching through paint layers revealing white ground beneath, creating delicate highlights and intricate details

**Texture Thickness Specifications**: Smooth surface application with minimal impasto. Paint layers 2-4mm maximum thickness. Mother-of-pearl inlay embedded flush with gesso surface. Incised areas showing subtle texture variation through differential paint absorption.

**Edge Treatment**: Sharp, precise contours maintaining Renaissance draftsmanship standards. No lost edges - every form clearly delineated. Mystical apparatus rendered with scientific illustration accuracy within impossible contexts.

**Detail Hierarchy with Proportional Specifications**:

- Alchemical apparatus: 100% scientific precision with mechanical impossibility
- Mystical figures: 95% detail with spiritual idealization
- Architectural environments: 90% precision with atmospheric luminosity
- Background elements: 80% detail maintaining mystical coherence

**Material Simulation with Authentic Characteristics**: Every surface (stone, metal, fabric, organic matter) rendered with material-specific behavior. Mother-of-pearl exhibits authentic iridescent light-catching properties. Incised areas show genuine oil absorption differential effects.

**Pose Anchors**:

- Spiritual elongation: 120-150% vertical proportion enhancement
- Mystical gesture precision: Hand positions accurate to alchemical practice traditions
- Seeker positioning: Classical contrapposto adapted to laboratory environments
- Eye contact: Direct spiritual engagement with viewer or mystical apparatus focus

**Scale Hierarchy**: Proportional relationships follow mystical rather than realistic logic - spiritual significance determines scale (apparatus 150-200% enlarged, seekers 120-150% elongated, symbolic elements sized according to spiritual importance).

**Material Authenticity**: Authentic oil painting surface with period-appropriate mixed media integration. Mother-of-pearl inlay exhibits genuine iridescent properties. Incising effects show authentic tool marks and oil absorption patterns.

**Period Consistency**: All technical methods documented from 1955-1963 Varo studio practice in Mexico City. Alchemical apparatus designs follow period esoteric illustration accuracy.

**Canvas Adaptation**: Composition specifically designed for declared aspect ratio with mystical narrative elements extending naturally to fill frame following spiritual geometry principles.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks**:

- **Mystical Robes**: Medieval-inspired flowing garments in earth tones (ochres, umbers, muted golds) with precise fabric drape physics
- **Alchemical Practitioner**: Hybrid contemporary/timeless clothing suitable for laboratory work with mystical accessory integration
- **Spiritual Seeker**: Practical journey clothing adapted for liminal threshold crossing and mystical apparatus operation

**Fabric Behavior**: All textiles rendered with material physics accuracy and spiritual significance. Flowing robes exhibit wind interaction and gravitational drape. Fabric textures show authentic weave patterns and dye characteristics. Mystical garments may incorporate impossible elements while maintaining material plausibility.

**Accessory Caps**: Moderate mystical integration (2-3 accessories) - each accessory carrying alchemical or spiritual significance from documented esoteric traditions.

**Color Palette Restrictions**: Earth-tone dominated palette (golden ochres, burnt umbers, muted greens, warm grays, selective bright accents). All pigments authentic to 1955-1963 availability with traditional mixing limitations. Luminous effects achieved through glazing technique rather than artificial brightness.

**Wardrobe Variation Required**: Primary garment treatment cycles through mystical traditions - avoid identical spiritual presentation. Each iteration requires different alchemical or esoteric cultural reference (European medieval, Mexican indigenous, Eastern mystical, hermetic tradition).

**Props**:

- **1 Hero Prop**: Selected from alchemical apparatus (astrolabe, alembic, mystical machine, scientific instrument adapted for spiritual use)
- **Optional 1 Micro Prop**: Small mystical elements (crystals, threads, keys, symbolic objects bridging material and spiritual realms)

**YAML Prop Pools**:

```yaml
alchemical_apparatus:
  - mystical_astrolabe: "celestial navigation instrument with impossible precision"
  - glass_alembic: "distillation apparatus processing spiritual essences"
  - thread_spinning_wheel: "reality-weaving device creating world fabric"
  - starlight_funnel: "apparatus channeling cosmic forces into tangible form"
  - sound_crystallizer: "machine converting music into visible light or solid form"
  - time_measurement_device: "clock or hourglass with mystical temporal properties"

spiritual_elements:

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary**: Omit entirely - Varo's mystical surrealism emphasized pure spiritual vision without text integration

**Text Policy**: No typography permitted. All mystical content communicated through visual symbolism and alchemical apparatus precision. Any text elements would violate authentic Varo aesthetic approach focusing on spiritual revelation through image alone.

**Historical Accuracy**: Varo's gallery works excluded text integration - maintained mystical art purity through visual spiritual communication exclusively. Mystical knowledge transmitted through symbol and technique rather than written language.

------

## Varo-Specific Guardrails
