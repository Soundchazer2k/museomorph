**Timeframe:** British Regency Romanticism, Royal Academy dominance (1790s-1830)

**Historical Context:** Thomas Lawrence was the leading British portrait painter of the Regency era, succeeding Sir Joshua Reynolds as Principal Painter to King George III. His style combined theatrical drama with virtuoso technique, elegant idealization with psychological penetration, and finished precision with atmospheric spontaneity - creating the definitive aesthetic of British Romantic portraiture.

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Photo-to-Painting Integration Mandate:** Modern photographic subject must be transformed into Lawrence's bravura oil painting aesthetic through:
  - Face rendered with smooth luminous finish (95% completion)
  - Hair dissolved into atmospheric brushwork (70% completion)
  - Fabrics showing selective finish with broken edges (60-70% completion)
  - Backgrounds loosely gestural, atmospheric (30% completion)
  - Controlled looseness hierarchy radiating from face outward
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement Protocol:** Combat ratio resistance through explicit multi-location declarations, repetitive reinforcement, negative constraints
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `glazing-layers-buildup` + `luminous-transparent` (Lawrence-specific custom flag)
  - Smooth blended finish in face only
  - Thin transparent glazes building luminosity
  - Warm flesh tones with porcelain highlights
  - Invisible brushwork in facial features
- **Pose Flags:** `elegant-contrapposto` (15-25° theatrical S-curve), `romantic-gesture` (expressive hand positions)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Lawrence's Regency bravura technique dominates; photographic subject transformed into elegant theatrical portrait with controlled looseness hierarchy
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language:
  - Face brushwork: 1-2mm fine detail, invisible strokes
  - Hair brushwork: 5-12mm sweeping visible strokes
  - Fabric highlights: 2-3mm impasto thickness
  - Background strokes: 15-25mm loose gestural marks
  - Controlled looseness: Face 95% finished, backgrounds 30% finished
- **Material Authenticity:** Oil on canvas with authentic Regency techniques:
  - Thin glazes for luminous flesh (0.3-0.8mm)
  - Selective impasto in fabric highlights (2-3mm)
  - Atmospheric dissolution through broken edges
  - Bravura brushwork demonstrating technical mastery
- **Safety Guardrails:**
  - No nudity - all figures fully clothed with Regency-appropriate modesty
  - Empire waist gowns with high necklines, long sleeves
  - Regency tailcoats, high-collared shirts, cravats for masculine subjects
- **Failure Mode Prevention:** Avoid:
  - Uniform finish across entire canvas (violates controlled looseness)
  - Heavy opaque flesh tones (must be transparent and luminous)
  - Literal photographic detail in backgrounds (must be atmospheric)
  - Digital smoothness everywhere (face smooth, everything else textured)
  - Hard edges throughout (edges must dissolve proportionally from face)

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[SELECT RATIO]** - ignore source photograph dimensions completely.

**RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **[SELECT RATIO]**. This is a hard requirement.

Transform modern photographic subject into **Thomas Lawrence's British Regency portrait aesthetic (1790s-1830)**, maintaining the subject's identity through elegant idealization while fully converting photographic characteristics into Lawrence's theatrical bravura painting language.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `glazing-layers-buildup` + `luminous-transparent` - Smooth blended finish with thin transparent glazes, warm porcelain highlights, invisible brushwork in facial features, psychological penetration through direct gaze.

**Pose Flag:** `elegant-contrapposto` (15-25° hip-shoulder S-curve creating theatrical grace)

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance:** Lawrence's Regency bravura technique completely dominates. Subject appears as if Lawrence painted them in oil during Regency period - smooth luminous face, visible hair brushwork, atmospheric fabric rendering, dissolved background edges, theatrical presentation, elegant idealization.

**Mode Selector:** Gallery (Royal Academy exhibition standard with Regency theatrical elegance)

**Final Ratio Confirmation:** Output must be exactly **[SELECT RATIO]**, no exceptions.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**RATIO SELECTION BY FORMAT:**

**Three-Quarter Length Portraits (Most Common):**

- Primary: `3:4` (portrait - standard format)
- Alternative: `4:5` (portrait - intimate format)
- Justification: Shows figure from head to mid-thigh or knee, allows elegant pose presentation with atmospheric background

**Full-Length Portraits:**

- Primary: `2:3` (portrait - tall format)
- Alternative: `3:4` (portrait - standard)
- Justification: Life-size theatrical presentation, full costume display, dramatic environmental integration

**Bust Portraits:**

- Primary: `3:4` (portrait - standard)
- Alternative: `1:1` (square - intimate focus)
- Justification: Close psychological engagement, emphasis on face and expression, minimal environmental context

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Ratio Status:** [Native NanoBanana ratio selected]
- **Photo-to-Painting Integration:** Subject extracted from modern context and recomposed into Lawrence's theatrical presentation with Regency costume and atmospheric setting
- **Reframing Method:** Strict reframe - subject repositioned with elegant contrapposto, period-appropriate environment constructed
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure slightly off-center for dynamism, 70-75% figure dominance, 25-30% atmospheric background
- **Background Treatment:** Atmospheric suggestion (stormy skies, landscape hints, architectural elements) rendered loosely, figures emerge from light-filled space
- **Format Justification:** Ratio serves Lawrence's Regency portrait tradition with theatrical elegance and atmospheric integration

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**EXPLICIT TEXTURE REQUIREMENTS - CONTROLLED LOOSENESS HIERARCHY:**

Paint surface MUST show DELIBERATE VARIATION in finish level radiating from face outward. This is the defining characteristic of Lawrence's bravura technique - NOT uniform finish across canvas. Face receives maximum precision, backgrounds dissolve into atmospheric gestures.

**CRITICAL HIERARCHY (Measurable Completion Levels):**

- **Face:** 95% finished - smooth, blended, invisible brushwork
- **Hands:** 85% finished - careful modeling with subtle visible strokes
- **Primary fabrics:** 70% finished - selective detail with broken edges
- **Hair:** 70% finished - fluid visible strokes dissolving into atmosphere
- **Secondary elements:** 50% finished - suggestive rendering
- **Backgrounds:** 30% finished - loose atmospheric gestures

**1. Oil Paint Application Anchor - MEASURABLE PAINT PHYSICS:**

**FACE RENDERING (MAXIMUM FINISH - 95% Complete):**

- **Application:** Thin transparent glazes 0.3-0.8mm building luminous porcelain quality
- **Brushwork visibility:** INVISIBLE - smooth blended finish with NO visible stroke marks in facial skin
- **Fine detail brush:** 1-2mm width for precise features (eyes, nostrils, lips, ear details)
- **Broader modeling brush:** 3-4mm width for cheek, forehead, neck transitions with subtle blending
- **Flesh tone transparency:** Paint MUST be thin enough to show canvas luminosity, NOT opaque heavy coverage
- **Highlight treatment:** Porcelain highlights (#f5e8dc) applied as thin luminous layer, not thick paste
- **Shadow treatment:** Warm transparent shadows (#d4b8a8) with gradual soft transitions over 3-6mm distance
- **NO thick paint on face:** Face is built through thin layered glazes, not impasto

**HAIR RENDERING (MODERATE FINISH - 70% Complete):**

- **Brushwork visibility:** HIGHLY VISIBLE - fluid sweeping strokes 5-12mm width
- **Application method:** Loaded brush in confident single-stroke deposits showing directional flow
- **Hair mass width:** Individual masses 8-15mm wide representing groups of hair, NOT fine individual strands
- **Color modulation:** Rich variation within single stroke - dark base to light highlight in one mark
- **Stroke direction:** Following hair fall and form curvature with fluid rhythmic motion
- **Completion strategy:** Hair mass defined but edges atmospheric, creating spontaneous unfinished quality

**HAIR EDGE DISSOLUTION (CRITICAL - Must Blend into Atmosphere):**

- **Transition zone:** Hair MUST dissolve into background through 8-12mm atmospheric blend at periphery
- **Application:** Hair edges become progressively looser and more transparent toward outer boundaries
- **Broken edge requirement:** NO hard cutout edges where hair meets background
- **Stroke integration:** Final hair strokes blend into background atmospheric strokes creating seamless merge
- **Color integration:** Hair color gradually incorporates background atmospheric tones at edges
- **Verification test:** Hair should appear to emerge from atmospheric background, not sit on top of it

**WHITE FABRIC RENDERING (SELECTIVE FINISH - 60-70% Complete):**

- **Impasto highlights:** 2-3mm thick paint ridges in peak illuminated folds creating dimensional relief
- **Shadow glazes:** 0.5-1mm thin transparent application showing canvas texture underneath
- **Brushwork visibility:** MODERATE - 4-8mm visible strokes in fold structures
- **Temperature modulation:** Cool shadows (#d4c4b0) vs. warm highlights (#f5f0e8) creating shimmering silk effect
- **Fold simplification:** Rhythmic simplified patterns, NOT literal photographic complexity
- **White-on-white mastery:** Pure white (#ffffff) peaks, cream mid-tones (#e8dcc8), cool shadow (#d4c4b0), deep fold (#b8a890)

**WHITE FABRIC EDGE DISSOLUTION (CRITICAL):**

- **Edge treatment:** Fabric edges must show 6-10mm dissolved zones where meeting background
- **Broken boundaries:** NO vector-crisp edges - all boundaries show painterly irregularity
- **Application method:** Final fabric strokes overlap with background strokes creating merged zones
- **Highlight edge softening:** Even brightest white highlights must have irregular softened boundaries (3-5mm transition)
- **Verification test:** Edges should appear painted into environment, not cut-and-pasted onto background

**DARK FABRIC RENDERING (SELECTIVE FINISH - 60-70% Complete):**

- **Shadow depth:** Thin transparent glazes 0.5-1mm creating rich velvet darkness
- **Highlight edges:** Selective 2-3mm thick paint at illuminated edges only
- **Color transparency:** Rich warm darks (#1a1410, #3d2820) allowing depth through layered glazes
- **Brushwork visibility:** MINIMAL in shadows, visible at edges and folds
- **Canvas texture:** Must show through thin dark areas creating organic quality

**DARK FABRIC EDGE DISSOLUTION (CRITICAL):**

- **Edge treatment:** Dark fabrics must show 4-8mm broken transitions losing hard boundaries
- **Selective highlights:** Edge highlights (2-3mm thick) must themselves have softened irregular boundaries
- **Application method:** Dark fabric strokes merge with background through overlapping transitional zone
- **NO clean cutouts:** All dark fabric boundaries must show atmospheric integration
- **Verification test:** Dark coat should appear to emerge from shadows, not float on surface

**FUR/TEXTILE TEXTURE RENDERING (IMPRESSIONISTIC - 50-60% Complete):**

- **Textural strokes:** Dragged brush creating fur-like marks 3-6mm length
- **Clustering:** Individual texture strokes grouped in masses, not literal photographic detail
- **Impressionistic suggestion:** Textural quality conveyed through brushwork character, not precise detail
- **Color variation:** Rich modulation within texture suggesting depth and dimension

**BACKGROUND RENDERING (ATMOSPHERIC - 30% Complete):**

- **Brushwork visibility:** MAXIMUM - loose gestural strokes 15-25mm width
- **Application:** Thin washes and sweeping gestures creating atmospheric suggestion
- **Characteristic quality:** Unfinished spontaneous feeling, NOT polished completion
- **Stroke economy:** Minimal marks creating maximum atmospheric effect
- **NO literal detail:** Pure suggestion of stormy skies, landscape elements, architectural hints through color and gesture only

**BACKGROUND STROKE VISIBILITY (CRITICAL - Must Be Obviously Loose):**

- **Individual strokes:** Each background stroke 15-25mm width must remain visible and distinguishable
- **Gestural quality:** Confident sweeping motions showing direction and rhythm
- **Color variation within strokes:** Background strokes show color shift from start to finish of mark
- **Stroke overlap:** Background strokes layer loosely, creating atmospheric depth through transparency
- **NO blended smoothness:** Background must NOT appear airbrushed or gradient-smooth
- **Verification test:** Should be able to count individual background brushstrokes when examining closely

**EDGE TREATMENT BY ZONE (CRITICAL - Proportional Softness):**

- **Face edges:** Soft but defined - 2-4mm gradual transition maintaining form clarity
- **Hand edges:** Soft defined - 3-5mm transition with subtle modeling
- **Fabric edges:** Broken irregular - 4-8mm dissolved zones losing hard boundaries
- **Hair edges:** Completely atmospheric - 8-12mm transition melting into background
- **Background edges:** Total dissolution - 10-15mm atmospheric blend with zero hard boundaries
- **Principle:** Edges soften proportionally to distance from focal point (face)

**Face Zone (95% Finish):**

- Smooth blended invisible brushwork
- Maximum detail in eyes, nose, mouth, ears (1-2mm precision)
- Subtle graduated modeling in cheeks, forehead, neck (3-4mm blending)
- Thin transparent glazes only (0.3-0.8mm total thickness)
- NO visible individual brushstrokes in facial skin
- Porcelain luminous quality

**Hand Zone (85% Finish):**

- Careful modeling with subtle visible strokes (2-4mm)
- Finger articulation with graceful elongation
- Knuckle highlights with dimensional modeling
- Gesture elegance emphasized
- Slightly less blended than face, but still refined

**Primary Fabric Zone (70% Finish):**

- Simplified rhythmic fold patterns
- Impasto highlights (2-3mm) creating dimension
- Broken irregular edges (4-8mm dissolved zones)
- Balance between finish and spontaneity

**Hair Zone (70% Finish):**

- Fluid visible strokes (5-12mm sweeping marks)
- Hair masses defined but edges dissolving (8-12mm transition)
- Rich color modulation within strokes
- Atmospheric integration at periphery
- Suggestion of form through confident brushwork

**Secondary Element Zone (50% Finish):**

- Props, jewelry, accessories
- Suggestive rendering (6-10mm strokes)
- Enough detail for recognition, not photographic literalism
- Subordinate to primary focal areas

**Background Zone (30% Finish):**

- Loose gestural strokes (15-25mm width)
- Atmospheric suggestion only
- Unfinished spontaneous quality
- Minimal detail, maximum effect
- Complete edge dissolution (10-15mm atmospheric blend)

- ✅ "dark fabric edges show 4-8mm broken transitions merging with atmospheric backgrounds"
- ✅ "backgrounds: loose gestural strokes 15-25mm width, atmospheric suggestion only, 30% completion level"
- ✅ "background strokes 15-25mm width remain individually visible and distinguishable - NOT blended smooth"
- ✅ "background shows confident gestural sweeping motions with color variation within individual strokes"
- ✅ "can count individual background brushstrokes when examining - obvious loose gestural quality"
- ✅ "edge dissolution proportional to distance from face: face 2-4mm soft, fabrics 4-10mm broken, hair 8-12mm atmospheric"

**Lawrence Color System:**

- ✅ "white fabrics: pure white (#ffffff) peaks 5%, cream (#f5f0e8) highlights 20%, warm mid-tones (#e8dcc8) 30%, cool shadows (#d4c4b0) 25%"

- ✅ "temperature modulation in white fabrics: warm highlights to cool shadows creating shimmering silk effect"
- ✅ "accent colors maximum 15% canvas: crimson (#8b2635), fur pelts (#b8946a, #f5e8d0), blues (#4a6c8c)"

**Lawrence Technical Specifications:**

- ✅ "atmospheric backgrounds: stormy skies, landscape suggestions, architectural hints rendered loosely"
- ✅ "photographic subject transformed into Lawrence's bravura portrait maintaining identity through elegant idealization"

**Vocabulary Warnings:** Avoid "uniform," "consistent," "same everywhere," "equal detail," "finished throughout" which contradict controlled looseness. Avoid "thick," "opaque," "heavy" for flesh tones which contradict luminous transparency. Emphasize "selective," "controlled variation," "deliberate hierarchy," "atmospheric dissolution," "luminous," "transparent," "bravura," "theatrical."

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**For Portrait Ratios (3:4, 4:5, 2:3):**

- Vertical emphasis with elegant standing or seated figure
- Figure dominance 70-75% of canvas
- Atmospheric background 25-30% suggesting environment
- Slight off-center placement for dynamism
- Diagonal compositional lines creating movement

**For Near-Square (1:1, 5:4):**

- Bust or three-quarter length emphasis
- Balanced composition with psychological focus
- Environmental suggestions in corners
- Central but not rigidly symmetrical placement

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**Perspective Regime:**

- Atmospheric perspective creating depth through edge dissolution and value reduction
- NOT rigid linear perspective - intuitive spatial suggestion
- Depth through color temperature shifts (warm foreground to cool distance)
- Selective focus: sharp face dissolving to atmospheric backgrounds

**Figure:Ground Ratio:**

- 70-75% figure/dramatic presentation
- 25-30% atmospheric background
- Background serves figure, never competes for attention
- Environmental elements subordinate to portrait subject

**Lighting Logic:**

- Single theatrical spotlight from upper left (45° angle standard)
- 30% face in full illumination, 45% transitional, 25% soft shadow
- Luminous quality suggesting outdoor natural light, not studio artificial
- Romantic glow creating overall luminosity
- Fabric highlights catching light dramatically

**Detail:Negative Space Ratio:**

- Maximum detail in face (10-15% of canvas)
- Moderate detail in hands, primary fabrics (30-40% of canvas)
- Minimal detail in backgrounds, atmospheric areas (50-60% of canvas)
- Controlled hierarchy directing viewer attention through selective completion

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:** Oil on canvas with Regency-era preparation, Royal Academy exhibition standards, theatrical Grand Manner tradition

**Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely - pure painted achievement with bravura brushwork

**Production Context Anchor:** British Regency period (1790s-1830), Royal Academy tradition, theatrical portraiture, controlled looseness technique demonstrating virtuoso mastery

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for [SELECTED RATIO] with theatrical elegance and atmospheric integration

**Environmental Integration:**

- Stormy skies: Dramatic cloud formations (#3a4a5a, #5a6c7d) suggesting Romantic sublime
- Landscape suggestions: Loose foliage masses (#4a5d3f, #6b7d5a) without literal detail
- Classical architecture: Simple column or drapery suggestions
- Atmospheric depth: Distance created through edge dissolution and value reduction
- All backgrounds rendered loosely (15-25mm strokes) at 30% completion level

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Omit entirely

**Historical Accuracy:** British Regency portraits (1790s-1830) focused purely on painted theatrical achievement through bravura brushwork, luminous technique, and controlled looseness without text integration. Lawrence's approach emphasized elegant idealization and psychological penetration through paint alone.

**Format-Specific Rules:** Royal Academy gallery standards and Regency salon display demanded pure artistic presentation without textual distraction. Any titles or dedications belonged on separate plaques or printed materials, not on the painted surface.
