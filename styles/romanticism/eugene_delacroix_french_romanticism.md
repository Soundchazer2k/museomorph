------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **5:4 ratio** (landscape) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

**RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **5:4**. This is a hard requirement.

Analyze the provided portrait. Redraw the subject entirely from scratch in Eugène Delacroix's French Romantic style (1822-1863).

- Preserve likeness through **passionate gesture, atmospheric color integration, psychological intensity**
- **Timeframe:** Peak French Romanticism, Salon exhibition period (1822-1863)
- **Degree of likeness:** Emotionally penetrating while maintaining dramatic grandeur; emphasis on inner passion over photographic accuracy
- **Emotional tone:** Passionate intensity, Romantic yearning, dramatic turmoil, psychological depth, Byronic heroism
- **Pose conventions:** Dynamic instability with 15-30° shoulder-hip differential; dramatic arm extension; asymmetrical weight distribution suggesting motion or emotional tension
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original French Romantic costume and setting avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `impasto-sculptural` + `glazing-layers-buildup`
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Delacroix's revolutionary color primacy and expressive brushwork overrides any source characterization - passion expressed clearly through paint
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery (French Salon standard with Romantic emotional intensity)
- **Final Ratio Confirmation:** Output must be exactly **5:4 ratio**, no exceptions

The final result must embody Romantic passion through chromatic intensity and dynamic brushwork while maintaining museum-grade technical authenticity.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `5:4` (landscape - natively supported by NanoBanana: 1152×896)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Ratio Status:** Native (5:4 supported directly)
- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely - extend atmospheric backgrounds with Romantic drama
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for dynamic instability - off-center, diagonal emphasis, emotional forward momentum
- **Background Treatment:** Extend smoky atmospheric effects, stormy landscapes, or exotic architectural elements with dissolved edges merging into color-saturated atmosphere
- **Format Justification:** 5:4 landscape ratio serves Delacroix's major Salon works tradition, allowing dramatic horizontal sweep while maintaining figure prominence - optimal for single-figure Romantic portraiture with atmospheric context

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Peter Paul Rubens (rich palette, dynamic composition, expressive color), Venetian Renaissance (Veronese, Titian - color primacy over line), Théodore Géricault (raw power, dramatic intensity), John Constable (color sparkle, flossing technique), Michel Eugène Chevreul (scientific complementary color theory), Lord Byron (sublime passion, tragic heroism), literary sources (Shakespeare, Goethe, Dante)

**Medium/Production method:** Oil on industrially prepared 19th-century canvas with revolutionary ground technique: initial distemper (water-based glue paint) lay-in covered with thin oil glazes creating signature matt-but-bright surface. Paint application: visible expressive brushstrokes, flossing (2-5mm delicate color strokes for sparkle), thin color cross-hatching in shadows, flochetage (division of touches), thick impasto (3-5mm) in highlights. Surface goal: non-glossy luminosity like pastel or watercolor.

**Thematic purpose:** French Romantic opposition to Neoclassical restraint - prioritizing emotional expression, passionate movement, chromatic intensity, and subjective vision over academic polish. Creating bridge between artist's interior world and beholder through scientifically informed yet feverishly imaginative painting.

**Hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**

- **Chevreul Complementary System:** 60-70% of figure rendering uses complementary shadows (yellow skin = violet shadows; red fabric = green shadows) achieving unprecedented chromatic intensity
- **Atmospheric Integration:** 70% backgrounds employ smoky blue-gray, brown-gray, or storm green-gray atmospheric effects; 30% saturated dramatic accents (crimson, emerald, golden ochre)
- **Dynamic Contrapposto:** 15-30° shoulder-hip angle differential creating passionate instability; 10-25° head tilt for psychological engagement; asymmetrical weight distribution
- **Expressive Surface Texture:** Visible brushwork with 2-5mm flossing strokes, 3-5mm impasto highlights, thin cross-hatched color shadows, flochetage creating vibrating paint surface
- **Soft Atmospheric Edges:** Figures dissolve into backgrounds through broken edges and color temperature shifts - rejecting hard neoclassical contours

**Period framing:** French Romanticism (1822-1863), opposition to Ingres's neoclassical linearity, Salon exhibition culture, post-North Africa journey (1832) exotic influence, scientific color theory application

**Tone Tag:** Passionate intensity, Romantic yearning, chromatic vibrancy, psychological penetration, dramatic turmoil, Byronic heroism

**Production Era Authenticity:** 1822-1863 French academic canvas preparation with distemper ground innovation, Chevreul color theory application, atmospheric painting techniques opposing neoclassical polish

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work - EXPLICIT TEXTURE REQUIREMENTS:** Paint surface MUST show individual brushstroke marks with distinct directional flow. Each stroke 2-5mm width, applied in clusters of 5-15 strokes per square inch in highlight areas. Stroke direction follows form curvature - vertical on arms, horizontal on shoulders, diagonal following fabric drape. Edges MUST be broken and irregular, not smooth gradients. Background atmospheric areas require loose, visible brushwork with 10-20mm wide sweeping strokes creating smoky texture. Canvas weave texture MUST be visible through thin paint areas. NO airbrush smoothness. NO digital gradient tools. Every surface area shows evidence of brush contact with varied pressure creating thick-to-thin paint deposits.

**Anatomical Stylization:** Academic 1:7.5 head-to-body ratio maintained; musculature emphasized through écorché study showing tension beneath surface; minimal exaggeration - realism prioritized over idealization; figures captured in powerful expressive motion with dynamic asymmetrical poses.

**Detail Hierarchy:** Strategic detail suppression preserving "larger effect" and "first pure expression" of imaginative vision; excessive detail avoided as it would "obscure the idea"; focus concentrated on emotionally critical areas (hands, face, dramatic gesture) while backgrounds dissolve atmospherically.

**Coloring Method - MANDATORY COMPLEMENTARY SHADOW SYSTEM:** CRITICAL: Shadows MUST use complementary colors, NEVER darkened local color. Specific requirements:

- Yellow/ochre skin: shadows rendered in violet (#8B7AB8) and blue-gray (#6B7B8C), NOT brown
- Red fabric: shadows rendered in blue-green (#2D5A5A) and teal (#1A4D4D), NOT dark red
- White fabric: shadows rendered in cool blue (#A4B8C4) and violet-gray (#9B8FA8), NOT gray
- Blue fabric: shadows rendered in orange-brown (#8B5A3C) and warm ochre (#A67C52), NOT dark blue
- Green fabric: shadows rendered in red-violet (#8B4A6B) and warm pink (#B85A7A), NOT dark green

Flesh tone construction: Base warm ochre (#C9A876) + rose undertone (#D4A5A5) + violet shadow (#8B7AB8) + blue-gray deep shadow (#6B7B8C). Apply shadows as distinct color strokes, not blended smoothness. Light areas receive thick paint, shadow areas receive thin transparent paint showing canvas texture underneath.

Background atmospheric color: 70% stormy blue-gray (#5A6C7D), smoky brown-gray (#6B5D52), green-gray (#5A6B5D); 30% saturated accents crimson (#8B2635), emerald (#2D5A4A), golden ochre (#B8914D).

**Texture Specifications - MEASURABLE PAINT PHYSICS:**

IMPASTO HIGHLIGHTS (required in 15-25% of painted surface):

- White fabric highlights: 3-5mm thick paint ridges casting micro-shadows
- Metal jewelry: 2-3mm thick paint creating dimensional shine spots
- Flesh tone cheekbones: 2mm thick warm ochre creating sculptural buildup
- Fabric fold peaks: 3mm thick paint following fold direction Apply impasto using palette knife drag marks (1-2mm wide parallel ridges) or thick brush deposit (single stroke 5-8mm wide showing brush hair separations)

FLOSSING TECHNIQUE (required in light-transition areas): Small delicate color strokes 2-5mm length, applied in clusters of 3-7 strokes creating sparkle effect. Specifically apply:

- Hair highlights: 3mm golden strokes overlapping darker base
- Fabric sheen: 4mm perpendicular strokes catching light
- Metal reflections: 2mm bright strokes at angles
- Atmospheric light: 5mm delicate touches in background Each flossing stroke MUST remain visible as individual mark, not blended

FLOCHETAGE (required throughout): Division of touches creating vibrating surface - apply paint as distinct dabs 3-8mm diameter, leaving tiny gaps (0.5-1mm) between adjacent color areas. Surface should show mosaic-like structure of individual color touches rather than smooth blending. Background clouds: 10-15mm loose touches. Fabric mid-tones: 4-6mm touches. Flesh mid-tones: 3-4mm touches blending at edges only.

CROSS-HATCHING SHADOWS (required in all shadow areas): Thin transparent strokes 1-2mm width, applied in 2-3 directional layers creating woven texture:

- First layer: violet shadow strokes diagonal 45°
- Second layer: blue-gray shadow strokes diagonal -45°
- Third layer (deep shadows only): darker complement strokes vertical Strokes MUST remain visible as linear marks, showing canvas texture between strokes

EDGE TREATMENT (required at all figure-background transitions): Broken irregular edges with 3-8mm soft transition zone. NO hard cutout edges. Paint figure edges using loose strokes that fade into background through: reduced paint thickness (thick to thin over 5mm distance), color temperature shift (warm figure to cool background over 8mm distance), stroke direction change (figure strokes perpendicular to edge, background strokes parallel to edge). Edges MUST show individual brush marks, not airbrushed blur.

CANVAS WEAVE VISIBILITY (required in thin paint areas): Canvas texture MUST be visible in: shadow areas (paint 0.5-1mm thin), background atmosphere (paint 1-2mm thin), transition zones (paint 1mm thin). Texture creates subtle grid pattern 1-2 threads per mm. NO flat digital surface smoothness.

SURFACE FINISH - MATT-BRIGHT EFFECT: Overall surface MUST appear non-glossy with irregular light reflection creating soft sheen, not mirror shine. Achieve through: thick impasto creating texture, thin glaze areas showing canvas, varied paint thickness creating uneven surface (height variation 0-5mm across painting). Surface reflects light diffusely like chalk or egg tempera, not like plastic or enamel.

**Pose Anchors:** Head positioning: 10-25° tilt creating psychological engagement and emotional intensity; Shoulder-hip differential: 15-30° contrapposto creating dynamic instability; Weight distribution: asymmetrical - figures rarely stable or centered, suggesting motion or passion; Gesture economy: dramatic arm extension (reaching, grasping, defensive) with 2-3 meaningful positions maximum emphasizing emotional state.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Proportions based on academic écorché study - realistic musculature with emphasized tension beneath surface; no stylistic elongation or distortion; natural human scale with passionate gestural amplification.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Paint surface texture with measurable three-dimensional relief: impasto 3-5mm peaks, thin areas 0.5-1mm showing canvas, flossing 2-5mm individual strokes, flochetage 3-8mm distinct touches, cross-hatch 1-2mm linear texture. Surface roughness creates light diffusion, not smooth reflection. Every square inch shows brush contact evidence.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All elements historically accurate to French Romantic period (1822-1863) with documented Chevreul color theory application, post-1832 North African influence, and anti-neoclassical technical methods.

**Production Method Anchor:** Visible brushwork texture throughout: thick impasto ridges in highlights, thin transparent glazes in shadows showing canvas weave, broken edges with individual stroke marks, mosaic-like flochetage surface structure, cross-hatched shadow texture, flossing sparkle strokes in transitions. Paint behaves as physical medium with dimensional buildup, not digital flat surface.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 5:4 landscape format with horizontal dramatic sweep while maintaining figure prominence at 70-75% canvas area.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks:**

- **Romantic Heroic (Masculine):** Flowing shirts with open collars suggesting Byronic passion, dark velvet coats, period trousers, exotic elements (turbans, North African textiles) if orientalist context, literary costume (medieval, Renaissance) if dramatic context
- **Romantic Feminine:** Empire waist gowns with flowing fabric suggesting movement, exotic dress (North African, Greek) with draped textiles covering modestly, passionate color choices (deep crimson, emerald, golden ochre), Romantic loose hair or exotic headdresses
- **Orientalist (Post-1832):** Ethnographically observed Moroccan/Algerian costume with cultural accuracy, rich textiles (brocades, embroidered fabrics), vibrant complementary color combinations, turbans, kaftans, flowing robes - all modestly draped
- **Literary Dramatic:** Period costume appropriate to source material (medieval for Dante, Renaissance for Shakespeare, ancient for classical subjects), theatrical grandeur with passionate color emphasis

**Fabric Behavior with Period Accuracy:**

- **Silk:** High reflectivity with complementary shadow system (red silk = green shadows), fluid drape suggesting passionate movement, broken edges from expressive brushwork
- **Velvet:** Light-absorbing depth rendered with thick impasto, rich texture through flochetage, dramatic dark accents
- **Cotton/Linen:** Flowing loose drape for Romantic informality, white highlights with thick impasto creating sparkle, atmospheric edge dissolution
- **Exotic Textiles:** Brocades with complementary color embroidery, North African patterns with chromatic intensity, gold threads with flossing highlight technique
- **Period Construction:** 1822-1863 garment structures with Romantic looseness opposing neoclassical rigidity, exotic influence from 1832 North Africa journey

**Accessory Caps:** Dramatic Romantic (2-3 items maximum)

- **Primary:** Exotic jewelry (North African pieces with turquoise, coral), literary props (books, scrolls), symbolic objects (flags, weapons if contextually appropriate)
- **Secondary:** Passionate color accents (crimson scarves, emerald ribbons), exotic headdresses, Romantic flowing elements
- **Micro:** Minimal decorative details subordinated to overall passionate effect

**Color Palette Restrictions:** French Romantic palette with Chevreul complementary system - warm ochre-based flesh with violet-blue/green-gray shadows, atmospheric backgrounds (deep blue-gray, smoky brown-gray, storm green-gray), dramatic accents (rich crimson, deep emerald, golden ochre), exotic influences (turquoise, coral, deep orange), tricolor symbolic elements (pure red, white, blue) when politically relevant.

**Wardrobe Variation Required:** Cycle through Romantic heroic, orientalist exotic, literary dramatic costume types - vary between flowing passionate dress and period-appropriate theatrical grandeur, maintain chromatic intensity through complementary color relationships.

**Props (≤2 total):**

- **Hero Prop:** Literary objects (books by Byron/Shakespeare/Goethe/Dante), exotic artifacts (North African weapons, textiles), symbolic elements (flags, liberty cap), dramatic natural elements (stormy skies, exotic landscapes)
- **Micro Prop:** Small passionate details (letters, flowers with dramatic color), exotic jewelry elements, symbolic accessories

**YAML Prop Pools:**

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (5:4 Landscape):**

- **Horizontal Emphasis:** Environmental context 25-35%, figure dominance 65-75% with dramatic horizontal sweep allowing atmospheric development
- **Dynamic Staging:** Diagonal movement through chaos, pyramidal structures for heroic subjects, vortex arrangements for passionate drama
- **Format Considerations:** Landscape proportions supporting French Salon tradition while maintaining figure psychological prominence with passionate gesture emphasis

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective Regime:** Intuitive atmospheric spatial construction rejecting rigid mathematical linear perspective; depth through color temperature shifts and edge softness; swirling masses creating chaotic but directed energy
- **Grid/Symmetry:** Dynamic asymmetry with passionate instability; rejection of neoclassical balanced stability; diagonal emphasis creating emotional momentum
- **Figure:Ground Ratio:** 70-75% figure/dramatic action, 25-35% atmospheric background with dissolved edges
- **Density Percentage:** Strategic detail concentration on emotionally critical areas (face, hands, gesture) optimized for Salon viewing distance (6-8 feet); background atmospheric dissolution subordinating excessive detail to larger passionate effect
- **Lighting Logic:** Chiaroscuro creating dramatic spotlight effects; warm light sources with complementary cool shadows (yellow light = violet shadows); atmospheric effects amplifying emotional turmoil
- **Detail:Negative Space Ratio:** Detail suppression preserving "first pure expression" of imaginative vision; negative atmospheric space supporting passionate figure prominence

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Industrially prepared 19th-century canvas with distemper ground beneath oil layers, French Romantic studio standards (1822-1863)
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely - pure painted Romantic achievement with passionate chromatic surface
- **Production Context Anchor:** French Salon exhibition standards with anti-neoclassical revolutionary technique, Chevreul color theory application, post-1832 North African exotic influence
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for 5:4 landscape format with horizontal dramatic sweep and figure psychological dominance

**Environmental Integration:** Smoky battlefields with atmospheric perspective, stormy seas with chromatic drama, exotic North African interiors with vibrant textiles, mysterious gloomy landscapes amplifying emotional turmoil, theatrical literary settings with passionate grandeur - all rendered with soft dissolved edges merging figures into atmospheric color-saturated environments.

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Omit entirely

**Historical Accuracy:** French Romantic Salon paintings (1822-1863) focused purely on painted passionate achievement through chromatic intensity and expressive brushwork without text integration. Delacroix's revolutionary approach emphasized emotional expression through scientifically informed color application and atmospheric paint surface opposing neoclassical textual elements.

**Format-Specific Rules:** Museum gallery standard emphasizes pure Romantic artistic achievement with passionate chromatic drama without textual distraction.
