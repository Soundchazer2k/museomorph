  Physical steampunk assemblage layers found brass, Bakelite knobs, portrait
  photography, and hand-tooled leather into reliquaries. Riveted frames,
  oxidized patina, and resin-cast cogs push the portrait into sculptural
  territory. We guide the layout so every bolt earns its place.

# Physical Mixed Media Assemblage Portrait Style

## 🔧 Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via photographic base integration with physical materials
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Material thickness measurements, shadow depth specifications, adhesive edge visibility override descriptive language
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `photo-illustration-collage` - Photographic portrait base with physical material assemblage overlay, maintaining facial recognition through dimensional layering
- **Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid` - Natural photographic pose adapted to assemblage environment
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` - Creative extension using physical material techniques
- **Media Hybrid Flag:** `photo-illustration-collage` - Mandatory integration of photographic and physical elements
- **Material authenticity:** Genuine physical assemblage with real dimensional materials, authentic aging, patina, and wear
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Contemporary assemblage/collage art techniques (1960s-present) with visible construction process
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Shadow depth measurements, material thickness, adhesive visibility specifications are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; original assemblage using non-copyrighted materials
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; dimensional edges natural to assemblage process

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **4:5 ratio** (contemporary art print format) - ignore source image dimensions completely
- Redraw subject entirely from scratch in **physical mixed media assemblage style (1960s-present)** for **contemporary collage art reproduction**
- Preserve likeness through **photographic portrait base** with authentic physical steampunk materials assembled on top - functional mechanical components, Victorian industrial apparatus, scientific instruments with real dimensional depth integrated into costume/environment
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original physical assemblage artwork using photographically-based steampunk portrait. Subject must wear authentic Victorian industrial costume (brass goggles, mechanical accessories, technical apparatus integrated into clothing). Use original photographic portrait as base with functional steampunk materials showing purpose and mechanical context
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `photo-illustration-collage`
- **Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend`
- **Media Hybrid Flag:** `photo-illustration-collage`
- **Style Dominance:** Functional steampunk integration and authentic material properties supersede decorative elements
- **Mode Selector:** Contemporary steampunk assemblage art / Industrial portrait collage

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `4:5` (modern assemblage art format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with physical material assemblage
- **Spatial Allocation:** Photographic portrait centered with 10-15% margin, steampunk materials integrated into portrait composition rather than peripheral decoration
- **Background Treatment:** Extend using aged technical papers, patent diagrams, scientific documents as substrate rather than decorative backdrop
- **Format Justification:** 4:5 ratio optimal for contemporary steampunk assemblage art presentation and gallery display (1960s-2025)
