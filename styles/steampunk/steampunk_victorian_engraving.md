# Victorian Engraving Portrait Style

## üîß Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1‚Üí8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `engrave-hatch` - Steel engraving cross-hatching with precise parallel lines, 0.5-1mm spacing, classical tonal gradation
- **Pose Flag:** `frontal-rigid` - Formal Victorian portrait positioning, three-quarter view preferred, scholarly dignified stance
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` - Recompose entirely for Victorian portrait conventions
- **Material authenticity:** Authentic steel engraving line work, no digital simulation
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1840-1890s steel engraving printing methods with characteristic engraving precision
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Line spacing, cross-hatch density, tonal range measurements are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; no artificial borders or credits

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (portrait format) - ignore source image dimensions completely
- Redraw subject entirely from scratch in **Victorian steel engraving style (1840s-1890s)** for **museum-quality technical illustration reproduction**
- Preserve likeness through **meticulous cross-hatched line work** and classical idealization typical of 19th-century scientific documentation
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original Victorian-era inspired character design avoiding copyrighted costume elements or modern steampunk fantasy without historical precedent
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `engrave-hatch`
- **Pose Flag:** `frontal-rigid`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Technical precision and scholarly documentation aesthetic supersedes photographic likeness
- **Mode Selector:** Technical illustration / Scientific documentation portrait

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (classical Victorian portrait print format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** recompose-entirely for Victorian portrait conventions
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject centered with 15-20% headroom, classical portrait framing
- **Background Treatment:** Extend period-appropriate Victorian workshop/laboratory setting or neutral technical illustration background
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 ratio matches standard Victorian book illustration and scientific plate dimensions (1840-1890)

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Artistic Style:** Victorian steel engraving technical illustration capturing scholarly precision and industrial-age documentation aesthetic (1840s-1890s)

**Medium/Production Method:** Steel engraving on paper - burin-incised copper plates with precise cross-hatching, parallel line technique, classical intaglio printing process

**Thematic Purpose:** Scientific documentation and scholarly illustration for educated Victorian audiences; technical mastery demonstration

**Hallmark Motifs:**

- Cross-hatched tonal gradation with 0.5-1mm line spacing
- Precise mechanical detail rendering (gears, instruments measured to 2-3mm accuracy)
- Classical proportion idealization (Victorian dignity standards)
- Technical apparatus integration (scientific instruments, precision tools)
- Scholarly environmental context (laboratories, workshops)

**Period Framing:** Peak steel engraving period (1840-1890), British and European technical illustration tradition

**Tone Tag:** Dignified scholarly precision, Victorian technical mastery, refined documentation aesthetic

**Production Era Authenticity:** Steel plate engraving with burin tools, copper plate preparation, traditional intaglio printing on cotton rag paper

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work Specifications:**

- Cross-hatching at 45-90¬∞ angles, 0.5-1mm spacing between parallel lines
- Burin tool marks visible, tapering line ends characteristic of steel engraving
- Minimum 3-layer cross-hatch for mid-tones, 5+ layers for deepest shadows
- Directional hatching follows anatomical forms (curved lines for facial contours)

**Tonal Range Measurements:**

- 8-12 distinct tonal values through line density variation
- Highlight preservation (pure white paper) 10-15% of composition
- Deep blacks (maximum cross-hatch density) 5-10% of composition
- Mid-tone gradation occupies 75-80% with precise line control

**Surface Depth:**

- Ink sits on paper surface, no impasto
- Plate impression visible as embossed border (optional, 2-3mm depth)

**Detail Hierarchy:**

- Facial features: maximum precision (individual eyelash lines visible)
- Costume elements: medium detail (fabric weave suggested through hatching patterns)
- Background: simplified linear treatment (30% detail reduction from foreground)

**Edge Treatment:**

- Clean, precise line terminations
- No feathered or soft edges - all transitions through line density

**Pose Anchors:**

- Head tilt: 5-15¬∞ maximum deviation from vertical
- Shoulder angle: subtle contrapposto, 10-20¬∞ rotation acceptable
- Weight distribution: formal standing 50/50 or seated upright
- Hand positions: scholarly gestures - holding instruments, demonstrative poses

**Scale Hierarchy:** Classical proportions unless Victorian idealization requires subtle refinement

**Material Authenticity:** Pure steel engraving technique - no wash effects, no tone plates, line work only

**Period Consistency:** All elements match 1840-1890 technical illustration standards

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Adult Masculine:**

- Primary: Victorian formal frock coat (black/dark grey), high collar white shirt, cravat/bow tie
- Secondary: Scientific expedition clothing - leather apron over vest, rolled sleeves
- Tertiary: Technical workwear - heavy wool jacket, brass-buttoned vest

**Adult Feminine:**

- Primary: Victorian high-necked dress with mutton sleeves, corseted bodice
- Secondary: Modified expedition dress - practical skirt, leather accessories
- Tertiary: Technical workshop attire - protective apron, simplified dress

**Fabric Behavior:**

- Heavy wools render through dense cross-hatching
- Leather shows parallel line highlights
- Brass/metal elements: precise geometric hatching

**Accessory Cap:** Elaborate (3-4 items)
