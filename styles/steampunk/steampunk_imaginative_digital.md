# Imaginative Digital Painting Portrait Style

## 🔧 Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression enhanced with fantastical elements
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `digital-painted` - Contemporary digital painting with painterly brushwork, fantastical lighting effects, brass/copper atmospheric glow
- **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` - Dynamic heroic positioning with fantastical machinery interaction
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` - Recompose for adventure poster aesthetics
- **Material authenticity:** Digital painting techniques authentic to 2000s-2020s steampunk art movement
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Contemporary digital art methods - Photoshop/Procreate brush engines, layer blending modes, digital lighting effects
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Brush size percentages, color temperature values, atmospheric effect measurements are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no copyrighted steampunk franchises; original neo-Victorian character design
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; no artificial borders or credits

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (poster format) - ignore source image dimensions completely
- Redraw subject entirely from scratch in **contemporary steampunk digital painting style (2000s-2020s)** for **fantasy art poster reproduction**
- Preserve likeness through **fantastical technological integration** and neo-Victorian aesthetic enhancement with heroic proportions
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original steampunk character design avoiding copyrighted elements from existing franchises (no recognizable airship designs, no trademarked mechanical styles, no specific literary character elements). Design unique fantastical technology and original neo-Victorian costume elements
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `digital-painted`
- **Pose Flag:** `power-stance`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Fantastical adventure aesthetic and imaginative technology supersedes photographic realism
- **Mode Selector:** Fantasy art poster / Character concept art

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (adventure poster / concept art format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** recompose-entirely for dynamic heroic framing
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for action - off-center dynamic placement with 10-20% headroom
- **Background Treatment:** Extend fantastical steampunk environment - Victorian architecture with impossible machines, brass cityscape, steam-filled atmosphere
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 ratio optimal for character-focused fantasy poster and modern digital art presentation (2000-2025)

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Artistic Style:** Contemporary steampunk digital painting capturing fantastical technology and neo-Victorian romance of modern steampunk culture (2000s-2020s)

**Medium/Production Method:** Digital painting created with pressure-sensitive stylus on graphics tablet - Photoshop/Procreate/Clip Studio Paint with custom steampunk brush libraries, layer blend modes for atmospheric effects, digital color dodge/burn for brass highlights

**Thematic Purpose:** Fantasy adventure art celebrating alternative history technology and neo-Victorian aesthetic for contemporary fantasy art audiences

**Hallmark Motifs:**

- Rich brass and copper atmospheric glow (color temperature 3000-3500K)
- Fantastical mechanical integration (30-40% of costume/composition includes imaginative technology)
- Neo-Victorian costume with impossible additions (mechanical limbs, steam-powered accessories)
- Dynamic action poses with machinery interaction
- Atmospheric steam effects and magical lighting (bloom intensity 20-30%)

**Period Framing:** Contemporary digital art movement (2000-present), influenced by artists like Kazuhiko Nakamura and Brian Kesinger

**Tone Tag:** Adventurously fantastical, technologically optimistic, heroically romantic, imaginatively dramatic

**Production Era Authenticity:** Digital painting workflow - sketch layer, color blocking, detail rendering, atmospheric effects layers, color grading, final polish with digital brushes mimicking oil painting texture

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Digital Painting Specifications:**

- **Brush work:** Variable pressure sensitivity, 15-40% opacity oil paint brushes, visible brush strokes 3-8mm equivalent scale
- **Blending method:** Color dodge for brass highlights, multiply layers for shadow depth, overlay for atmospheric steam
- **Edge treatment:** Soft edges for atmospheric elements (30% hardness), crisp edges for mechanical details (85-95% hardness)
- **Stroke economy:** 60-80% coverage with intentional negative space, directional strokes following form

**Color Temperature Measurements:**

- Warm highlights: 3000-3500K (brass, copper, golden steam)
- Cool shadows: 5500-6500K (blue atmospheric depth)
- Midtone balance: 4000-4500K

**Lighting Specifications:**

- Primary light: Warm directional (brass/copper source), 70% intensity
- Rim light: Cool atmospheric, 40% intensity, creates separation from background
- Fill light: Ambient steam glow, 25% intensity
- Specular highlights: Sharp brass reflections, 95-100% white value

**Atmospheric Effect Measurements:**

- Steam particle density: 20-30% opacity, variable size 2-15mm
- Volumetric lighting: 15-25% opacity light rays, directional from mechanical sources
- Depth fog: Exponential fade starting at 60% background depth

**Pose Anchors:**

- Head tilt: Dynamic 20-35° angles for heroic energy
- Shoulder-hip differential: 25-45° rotation for action poses
- Weight distribution: 70/30 asymmetric for dynamic stance
- Hand positions: Interaction with fantastical machinery, weapon grips, mechanical control gestures

**Scale Hierarchy:** Heroic proportions - subtle idealization (105-110% normal proportions), emphasize power and adventure capability

**Material Authenticity:** Authentic digital painting techniques - no photo overlays, hand-painted texture rendering, brush-based atmospheric effects

**Period Consistency:** All elements reflect 2000s-2020s digital fantasy art standards with steampunk aesthetic integration

------

- **Figure:Ground:** 65% subject with mechanical elements, 35% fantastical environment
- **Density:** 75% coverage - rich detail with atmospheric breathing room
- **Lighting Logic:** Multi-source fantastical lighting - brass glow, steam illumination, magical energy sources
- **Detail:Negative Space:** 70% detailed rendering, 30% atmospheric fade areas

**Environmental Elements:**

- Fantastical Victorian architecture (impossible clockwork buildings, brass spires)
- Imaginative machinery (floating gear platforms, steam-powered impossible devices)
- Alternative history atmosphere (airships in distance, mechanical cities, brass sky)

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Frame/Band:** OMIT - no decorative borders (modern fantasy art convention)
- **Production Context:** Digital painting workflow with layer-based rendering, suitable for gallery print or digital portfolio
- **Ratio Enforcement:** Composition specifically designed for 2:3 adventure poster format with dynamic subject placement

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Allow (optional for poster variant)

**If Typography Included:**

**Ratio-Appropriate Zones:**

- Top 15%: Title/character name placement potential
- Bottom 20%: Subtitle/tagline zone
- Integrated with composition: Technical labels for mechanical elements

**Copy Limits:**

- ≤6 words per line
- Character name: 1-3 words maximum
- Tagline: ≤7 words
- No extensive body copy

**Period-Appropriate Typography:**

- Integration with brass/copper color scheme
- **Font Recommendation:** "Closest Google Font: Cinzel (neo-Victorian serif, 90% match). Alternative: Playfair Display. Better: Custom steampunk display fonts like Gaslight or Airship"

**Format-Specific Rules:**

- Character poster mode: Name prominent, heroic presentation
- Concept art mode: Technical annotations, mechanical labels
- Gallery print mode: Minimal or no text, pure visual focus

**Historical Accuracy:** Typography reflects contemporary steampunk aesthetic (2000s-2020s), not historical Victorian
