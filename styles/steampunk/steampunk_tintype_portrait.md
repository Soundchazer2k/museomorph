  Steampunk tintypes mimic wet-plate chemistry—silver nitrate drips, solarized
  highlights, and shallow depth of field hugging brass goggles and boilers.
  Costumes stay era-correct while inventions peek through the patina. We tune
  the lab artifacts and imperfections for credibility.

# Steampunk Tintype Portrait Style (Victorian Photography with Industrial Elements)

## 🔧 Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via authentic Victorian photographic rendering
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications for grain, exposure, plate characteristics override descriptive language
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `silver-halide-grain` - Authentic wet plate collodion rendering with characteristic grain pattern, limited dynamic range 4-5 stops, ethereal soft focus quality
- **Pose Flag:** `frontal-rigid` - Formal Victorian portrait pose required due to historical exposure time constraints
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` - Recompose for Victorian photographic plate conventions
- **Material authenticity:** Authentic wet plate collodion characteristics, tintype metal texture, daguerreotype mirror-like surface
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1850s-1890s wet plate photography methods with characteristic imperfections
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Exposure time implications, tonal range 4-5 stops, grain size measurements are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no modern elements; authentic Victorian photography aesthetic only
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; period-appropriate presentation only

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** (carte de visite format) - ignore source image dimensions completely
- Redraw subject entirely from scratch in **Victorian wet plate photography style with steampunk elements (1855-1890s)** for **steampunk tintype portrait reproduction**
- Preserve likeness through **authentic photographic rendering** with characteristic wet plate collodion ethereal quality enhanced by Victorian industrial/steampunk costume and apparatus
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create period-authentic Victorian photographic portrait WITH steampunk elements. Subject must wear Victorian-era steampunk costume (brass goggles, mechanical accessories, technical apparatus). Include period-appropriate scientific instruments and industrial props authentic to 1850s-1890s technology
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `silver-halide-grain`
- **Pose Flag:** `frontal-rigid`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Authentic Victorian photographic characteristics with steampunk costume/props integration - embrace historical photography limitations while showcasing industrial-era innovation
- **Mode Selector:** Steampunk historical photograph / Victorian inventor portrait

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (carte de visite / cabinet card format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** recompose-entirely for Victorian portrait photography conventions
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject centered with minimal headroom (5-10%), tight formal framing typical of 1860s-1890s portraits
- **Background Treatment:** Simple dark backdrop or minimal Victorian studio setting, avoid environmental complexity
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio matches standard Victorian carte de visite (2.5"x4") and cabinet card (4.25"x6.5") formats

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Artistic Style:** Victorian wet plate collodion photography with steampunk costume and industrial apparatus, capturing authentic tintype/daguerreotype aesthetic of 1850s-1890s portrait photography combined with Victorian-era scientific instruments and mechanical accessories

**Medium/Production Method:**

- **Tintype (Ferrotype):** Wet plate collodion on thin enameled iron sheet, creates underexposed negative appearing as positive on dark backing
- **Daguerreotype:** Direct positive on silver-plated copper, mirror-like surface, laterally reversed
- **Wet Collodion Process:** Glass plate coated with collodion emulsion, exposed while wet, developed immediately with characteristic ethereal rendering

**Thematic Purpose:** Authentic historical portrait photography documenting Victorian-era inventors, engineers, and scientists with their industrial apparatus; timeless archival quality showcasing early steampunk aesthetic (before the term existed)

**Hallmark Motifs:**

- Monochromatic sepia tones (2700-3200K warmth) or neutral black/white
- Limited dynamic range (4-5 stops maximum)
- Ethereal soft focus quality (light hair appears dark, blue eyes intensely bright)
- Characteristic grain pattern (0.1-0.3mm silver halide crystals visible)
- Subtle vignetting (10-20% edge darkening)
- Mirror-like reflective quality (daguerreotype) or matte metal surface (tintype)

**Period Framing:** Victorian photography era (1850-1900), American and European portrait studio tradition

**Tone Tag:** Hauntingly timeless, solemnly dignified, ethereally preserved, historically authentic

**Production Era Authenticity:**

- Wet plate preparation on-site in portable darkroom
- Exposure times 3-60 seconds requiring head restraint devices
- Chemical development immediately after exposure
- Fixing in sodium thiosulfate solution
- Optional hand-tinting with transparent oils

**Innovation Line:**

- **Lighting:** Daylight studio with diffusion scrims, no artificial lighting
- **Format:** 3:4 ratio carte de visite or cabinet card size
- **Processing:** Wet plate collodion immediate development
- **Collaboration:** Subject immobility required, photographer as chemical technician

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Photographic Specifications:**

- **Camera:** Large format 4x5" or 8x10" view camera equivalent
- **Lens:** Petzval portrait lens f/3.5-f/5.6, characteristic swirly bokeh, soft vignetting
- **Film/Plate:** Wet collodion on iron (tintype) or silvered copper (daguerreotype), ISO equivalent 1-6
- **Exposure:** 5-30 second equivalent creating slight motion blur potential

**Tonal Range Measurements:**

- **Highlights:** Clipped at 95-100% (metallic shine for daguerreotype, matte white for tintype)
- **Shadows:** Crushed below 5-10% (metal showing through on tintype, mirror reflection on daguerreotype)
- **Mid-tones:** Compressed into 4-5 distinct values
- **Contrast:** High contrast with abrupt transitions between tones

**Grain Characteristics:**

- Silver halide crystal visibility: 0.1-0.3mm apparent size
- Random distribution pattern, more visible in mid-tones
- Slight directional streaking from collodion flow during coating

**Lighting Specifications:**

- **Primary:** Diffused north-facing daylight, 60-70% intensity
- **Fill:** Reflected daylight from white card, 20-30% intensity
- **Modeling:** Single directional source, creates dramatic shadow definition
- **Quality:** Soft due to large diffused source, harsh shadows from long exposure

**Processing Artifacts:**

- Chemical staining (5-10% of surface area)
- Uneven collodion coating (visible flow marks)
- Edge darkening/vignetting (15-25% intensity increase toward edges)
- Emulsion imperfections (1-3 visible spots per portrait)

**Pose Anchors:**

- **Head tilt:** 0-5° maximum (head brace required for long exposure)
- **Shoulder angle:** Minimal rotation, 5-10° maximum
- **Weight distribution:** Rigid seated or standing, 50/50 balance
- **Hand positions:** Resting on lap, holding chair back, completely still
- **Expression:** Neutral to slight severity (smiling causes blur)

**Scale Hierarchy:** True-to-life proportions, no idealization due to documentary nature

**Material Authenticity:**

- Metal plate texture visible through image (tintype)
- Mirror-like reflectivity (daguerreotype)
- Authentic wet plate collodion rendering characteristics

**Period Consistency:** All elements authentic to 1850-1900 photographic portrait conventions

**Accessory Cap:** Elaborate (3-4 items) - steampunk/industrial elements essential for style

- Brass goggles (worn on head or around neck, period-accurate design)
- Technical instruments (compass, calipers, measuring devices)
- Pocket watch with exposed mechanism (brass chain visible)
- Scientific apparatus (small brass instruments, leather tool pouches)

**Color Palette:**

- Monochromatic sepia: warm brown tones (2700-3200K)
- Alternative: neutral black/white (daguerreotype)
- Optional hand-tinting: brass/copper elements highlighted with transparent oils, 20-30% opacity

**Wardrobe Variation:** Cycle through formal scientist, field engineer, and workshop inventor Victorian attire with steampunk accessories (1850-1890)

**Props (≤2):**

```yaml
steampunk_tintype_hero:
  - scientific_instrument: "brass microscope, telescope, or technical apparatus on table, period 1850-1890"

**Vocabulary Warnings:** Avoid "sharp," "clear," "high-resolution" (incompatible with wet plate limitations); avoid "colorful," "vibrant" (monochromatic medium only)

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**PORTRAIT RATIO COMPOSITION (3:4):**

- Vertical emphasis with subject dominance ≥85%
- Tight formal framing typical of Victorian studio portraiture
- Centered composition with minimal environmental context

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective:** Straight-on eye level, single point perspective
- **Figure:Ground:** 85% subject, 15% simple background
- **Density:** 40% coverage - significant negative space due to vignetting
- **Lighting Logic:** Single diffused daylight source, dramatic shadow modeling
- **Detail:Negative Space:** 50% visible detail (limited by exposure latitude), 50% tonal compression/vignetting

**Environmental Elements:**

- Simple painted backdrop (dark neutral or cloudy sky pattern)
- Minimal Victorian studio furniture (posing chair, column prop)
- Plain dark or medium toned background (avoids distracting detail)

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context:** Metal plate (tintype) or silvered copper (daguerreotype) with characteristic reflectivity
- **Frame/Band:** Period-appropriate case presentation (optional) - leather or wood case with velvet lining for viewing
- **Production Context:** Wet plate collodion on metal substrate, chemical processing, studio daylight exposure
- **Ratio Enforcement:** Composition specifically designed for 3:4 Victorian photographic format

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** OMIT typography (pure photographic portrait)

**Historical Context:** Victorian photographs rarely included text within the image itself. Any labeling was external (studio stamps on card backing, handwritten notes on reverse).

**If Typography Required (exceptional cases):**

- Studio imprint on mount card (not on photograph itself)
- Embossed studio name on presentation case
- Handwritten identification on reverse (not visible in image)

**Format-Specific Rules:**

- Museum archival print: No text
- Historical reproduction: Studio information on separate mount
- Period presentation: Text only on case/frame exterior

**Historical Accuracy:** No text integration within photographic image - maintain pure Victorian portrait photography conventions
