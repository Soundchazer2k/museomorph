  Gothic ink-wash steampunk drapes characters in Victorian mourning couture,
  soot-stained gears, and rain-smeared glass. Wet brush, raven-black pools, and
  selective copper highlights create a melancholic ballroom of machines. Expect
  wraithlike poses and intricate filigree.

# Gothic Ink Wash Portrait Style (Steampunk Dark Romanticism)

## 🔧 Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via atmospheric rendering with Gothic mood enhancement
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications for wash density, contrast ratios, shadow percentages override descriptive language
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `brush-wash` - Controlled ink wash with selective detail preservation in facial features, atmospheric blending in shadows, dramatic chiaroscuro effects
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` - Dramatic Gothic positioning with mysterious industrial interaction
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` - Creative extension using atmospheric ink wash techniques
- **Material authenticity:** Authentic ink wash on paper with water-based blending, no digital effects
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Gothic Revival era (1840-1910) ink wash illustration methods with romantic atmosphere
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Wash opacity percentages, contrast measurements, shadow depth specifications are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; original Gothic steampunk interpretation
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; atmospheric edges part of composition

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** (Gothic portrait format) - ignore source image dimensions completely
- Redraw subject entirely from scratch in **Gothic steampunk ink wash style (1840s-1910s Gothic Revival)** for **atmospheric dark romantic portrait reproduction**
- Preserve likeness through **dramatic chiaroscuro** with facial features maintained through selective detail preservation, atmospheric mood dominates overall composition
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original Gothic steampunk character with dark Victorian romantic aesthetic. Include mysterious industrial elements, Gothic costume details, and atmospheric mechanical props. No copyrighted Gothic literature characters or modern horror elements
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `brush-wash`
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend`
- **Style Dominance:** Gothic atmospheric mystery and dramatic shadow play supersede photographic clarity while preserving essential facial likeness
- **Mode Selector:** Gothic romantic illustration / Dark Victorian art print

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (Gothic portrait / dark romantic illustration format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with atmospheric ink wash elements
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned with 15-25% headroom, dramatic off-center placement for Gothic tension
- **Background Treatment:** Extend using atmospheric ink washes, mysterious industrial shadows, Gothic architectural elements fading into darkness
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio optimal for Victorian Gothic illustration and dark romantic portraiture (1840-1910)

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Artistic Style:** Gothic steampunk ink wash capturing atmospheric mystery and industrial Gothic darkness of Victorian dark romanticism (1840s-1910s) with selective detail preservation

**Medium/Production Method:**

- Water-based ink wash on heavyweight paper
- Brush application with controlled blending
- Selective detail rendering in facial features
- Atmospheric wash gradation in backgrounds
- Dramatic shadow pooling with ink concentration
- Sepia or black ink with water dilution 10-90% opacity

**Thematic Purpose:** Gothic romantic illustration emphasizing industrial mystery, dark Victorian atmosphere, and steampunk melancholy for collectors of atmospheric dark art

**Hallmark Motifs:**

- Dramatic chiaroscuro with 70-80% shadow coverage
- Selective facial detail preservation (eyes, key features rendered with 60-80% detail retention)
- Atmospheric ink wash backgrounds (20-40% opacity gradations)
- Gothic industrial elements emerging from shadows
- Mysterious mechanical apparatus suggestion (40-60% visibility)

**Period Framing:** Gothic Revival industrial period (1840-1910), influenced by Romantic movement darkness and Victorian Gothic literature

**Tone Tag:** Mysteriously atmospheric, dramatically shadowed, romantically dark, industrially Gothic, hauntingly beautiful

**Production Era Authenticity:** Traditional ink wash techniques - brush-loaded application, water dilution control, paper absorption effects, atmospheric blending
