------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Fashion icon transformation via sophisticated styling and pose rather than documentary realism.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("rotogravure screen pattern", "offset lithography precision") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Era-authentic printing methods supersede modern digital perfection.
- **Material Physics Authority:** Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Use era-specific printing methods (1960s rotogravure vs 1990s+ offset lithography) with characteristic surface finishes.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `color-surge` (high-quality fashion photography with period-appropriate processing)
- **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` (sophisticated fashion poses emphasizing elegance and authority)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (optimize for magazine cover format)
- **Font Authentication Authority:** "ROGUE" masthead must use Didot letterforms (closest Vogue approximation) - NO font variations permitted
- **Fashion Photography Mandate:** High-fashion styling with luxury presentation filling entire canvas
- **Era Selection Authority:** Choose specific Vogue era (1960s Vreeland "Youthquake" OR 1990s+ Wintour "High/Low") with corresponding production methods
- **Fashion Parody Authority:** Headlines must be satirical and absurd, mocking fashion industry conventions through impossible scenarios
- **Subject Regeneration Authority:** Subject's styling, pose, and fashion presentation must be completely regenerated to authentically portray absurd fashion scenarios described in generated headlines
- **Fashion-Subject Integration Mandate:** Subject's styling, pose, and expression must reflect genuine experience of the impossible fashion situation, not generic fashion posing
- **Satirical Fashion Authority:** Fashion scenarios generated contextually using absurd premise templates, with subject regenerated to embody that comedic narrative
- **Production Method Authority:** Era-specific printing characteristics (rotogravure matte finish OR offset lithography gloss) are REQUIRED
- **Integrated Design Philosophy:** All elements (styling, pose, typography) must work as unified high-fashion concept
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Allow sophisticated fashion magazine text integration.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; parody masthead "ROGUE" only.
- **Material authenticity:** Era-specific printing characteristics with authentic surface finishes and production limitations.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
