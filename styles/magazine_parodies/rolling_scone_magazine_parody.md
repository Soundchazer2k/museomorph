**Version:** 4.2

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Rock icon transformation via theatrical staging and intimate portraiture rather than documentary realism.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("silver-halide grain structure", "offset lithography newsprint") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** 1970s film photography and offset printing methods supersede modern digital perfection.
- **Material Physics Authority:** Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Use 1970s-1980s offset lithography on newsprint-like paper with characteristic texture and grain.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `film-grain-triX` (authentic 35mm film photography with visible grain structure)
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` (intimate rock portraiture emphasizing character revelation)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (optimize for magazine cover format)
- **Font Authentication Authority:** "ROLLING SCONE" masthead must use psychedelic ornate letterforms (Rick Griffin style) - NO modern fonts permitted
- **Rock Photography Mandate:** Intimate rock portraiture with theatrical staging filling entire canvas
- **Baking Parody Authority:** Rock scenarios must incorporate satirical baking elements through props, poses, and headlines
- **Subject Regeneration Authority:** Subject's styling, pose, and rock presentation must be completely regenerated to authentically portray rock-baking crossover scenarios
- **Rock-Baking Integration Mandate:** Subject's styling, pose, and expression must reflect genuine experience of impossible rock-baking situations
- **Satirical Rock Authority:** Rock scenarios generated contextually with baking parody elements, with subject regenerated to embody that comedic narrative
- **Production Method Authority:** Offset lithography on newsprint-texture paper with visible film grain are REQUIRED
- **Integrated Design Philosophy:** All elements (rock styling, baking props, typography) must work as unified rock parody concept
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Allow rock magazine text integration with baking humor.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; parody masthead "ROLLING SCONE" only.
- **Material authenticity:** 1970s-1980s film photography characteristics with authentic newsprint printing texture.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
