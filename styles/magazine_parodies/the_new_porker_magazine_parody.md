## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Sophisticated urban illustration with witty visual commentary over commercial photography.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("150 LPI halftone", "watercolor wash coverage") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Authentic illustration techniques supersede digital appearance descriptions.
- **Material Physics Authority:** Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Use era-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `painterly-contour` (sophisticated illustration with period-appropriate rendering)
- **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` (urbane social observation with natural human staging)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (optimize for magazine cover format)
- **Masthead Authority:** "THE NEW PORKER" masthead ONLY - explicitly prohibit "THE NEW YORKER" text - must use serif letterforms matching New Yorker classical style but with parody name only
- **Illustration Mandate:** Traditional pen, ink, and watercolor techniques with sophisticated urban sensibility, not photography
- **Subject Regeneration Authority:** Subject's appearance, expression, and food interaction must be completely regenerated to authentically portray the specific culinary-social scenario described in the satirical premise
- **Food-Social Integration Mandate:** Subject's actions, social context, and cultural staging must authentically demonstrate someone actively engaged with or experiencing the food scenario - not posing with static food props
- **Dynamic Satirical Authority:** Headlines generated contextually based on desired food-culture juxtaposition, with subject regenerated to match that narrative
- **Urbane Tone Authority:** Sophisticated, witty commentary with gentle satirical edge and intellectual food humor
- **Cultural Context Authority:** New York intellectual/cultural settings essential for satirical storytelling
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes - satirical headlines essential for food commentary.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; parody masthead "THE NEW PORKER" only.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters; surface must exhibit authentic period illustration characteristics with traditional media texture.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
