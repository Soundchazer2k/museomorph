**Version:** 4.2
 **Purpose:** A comprehensive framework for creating authentic Life Magazine parody covers using "Lies" as the IP-safe masthead, enforcing 1940s-1960s photojournalistic authenticity with period-appropriate production methods.

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("150 LPI halftone", "3-5mm ink spread") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Authentic letterpress halftone printing supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Material Physics Authority:** Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Use 1940s-1960s printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `film-grain-triX` (authentic documentary photography with visible grain structure)
- **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` (photojournalistic authenticity with natural human moments)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (optimize for magazine cover format)
- **Font Authentication Authority:** "LIES" masthead must use Helvetica Condensed Bold letterforms (closest Life Magazine approximation) - NO font variations permitted
- **Full-Bleed Photography Mandate:** Photography fills entire canvas edge-to-edge with no background elements or separate spaces
- **Text Overlay Authority:** Headlines as direct text overlays (white/black/off-yellow) with NO background boxes or blocks
- **Period Color Mandate:** Original black-and-white photography capture (not digital filters) for 1940s-1950s authenticity with red masthead as only color element
- **Subject Regeneration Authority:** Subject's face, expression, pose, and environmental interaction must be completely regenerated to authentically portray the specific scenario described in the headline
- **Headline-Subject Integration Mandate:** Subject's actions, facial expressions, and body language must reflect and illustrate the absurd scenario in the generated headline
- **Dynamic Headline Authority:** Headlines generated contextually based on desired absurd scenario, with subject regenerated to match that narrative
- **Halftone Visibility Authority:** Visible halftone dot patterns with ink spread artifacts are REQUIRED, not optional
- **Integrated Design Philosophy:** All elements (art, lettering, headlines) must work as unified narrative concept with subject embodying the headline's premise
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes - default to minimal text approach.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; parody masthead "LIES" only.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing; surface must exhibit authentic 1940s-1960s halftone characteristics with visible dots and grain.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (magazine cover format) - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Life Magazine photojournalistic style (1940s-1960s)** for **magazine cover format**.
- **Masthead:** Replace with "**LIES**" in Life Magazine's distinctive white letters on red background.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original parody avoiding Life Magazine copyrighted elements while capturing photojournalistic essence.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Complete edge-to-edge black-and-white photography coverage with masthead and text overlaid directly on image
- **Spatial Allocation:** 100% photography coverage with strategic overlay positioning for text readability
- **Background Treatment:** NO separate background elements - black-and-white photograph IS the entire canvas
- **Format Justification:** Full-bleed black-and-white format maximizes visual impact and 1940s-1950s documentary authenticity

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Life Magazine photojournalism (1936-1972), Margaret Bourke-White, Robert Capa, Gordon Parks, American documentary photography tradition.
- **Medium/Production method:** Black-and-white and color documentary photography reproduced via letterpress halftone printing on heavily coated paper stock.
- **Thematic purpose:** Documenting American life and global events through compelling visual storytelling with humanistic cultural significance.
- **Hallmark motifs:** Heroic portraits, candid news moments, human-interest features, cultural icons, historical documentation.
- **Period framing:** 1940s-1960s American photojournalism golden age with authentic magazine production methods.
- **Tone Tag:** Authoritative, humanistic, culturally significant with emphasis on American life and global events.
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Letterpress halftone printing with visible dot patterns, ink spread characteristics, and period-appropriate color limitations.

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**TECHNICAL EXECUTION ANCHORS (Critical - REQUIRED):**

- **Halftone Visibility Mandate:** VISIBLE 120-150 LPI halftone dots with dark ink halos and white/light centers (letterpress artifact) - dots must be individually discernible, not smooth gradients
- **Film Grain Authority:** Authentic Tri-X film grain structure visible at 400-800 ISO equivalent - surface must show photographic grain, not digital smoothness
- **Paper Texture Anchor:** Heavily coated paper stock with tactile surface variation of 0.2-0.5mm from halftone impression
- **Registration Drift Requirement:** Deliberate color registration drift of 0.5-1mm typical of 1940s-1960s printing technology
- **Ink Spread Specification:** High-viscosity letterpress ink with 2-3mm spread creating visible darker dot edges under magnification
- **Tonal Limitation Anchor:** Restricted dynamic range reflecting period film stock and printing constraints - avoid modern high-contrast
- **Surface Imperfection Authority:** Include period printing artifacts: slight paper texture visibility, ink inconsistencies, registration marks
- **Detail Hierarchy Anchor:** Sharp focus on human subjects with documentary precision, environmental context rendered with period lens characteristics

**POSE ANCHORS:**

- Head positioning: Natural documentary angles with authentic human moments
- Eye contact: Direct engagement or narrative-appropriate gaze direction
- Gesture economy: Candid, unposed movements capturing human authenticity
- Environmental integration: Subject placement supporting documentary storytelling

**PERIOD CONSISTENCY ANCHOR:** All elements historically coherent with 1940s-1960s magazine production methods and photojournalistic conventions.

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**WARDROBE TRACKS:**

- **Period-accurate American clothing:** Natural, unposed styling reflecting 1940s-1960s fashion appropriate to subject and story context
- **Fabric behavior:** Natural drape and authentic period materials with documentary authenticity
- **Accessory caps:** Minimalist 0-2 accessories supporting documentary realism
- **Color palette:** Period-appropriate colors limited by available dyes and printing technology of the era

**WARDROBE VARIATION:** Cycle through period-appropriate palette avoiding identical repetition between iterations.

**PROPS:** 1 hero prop maximum, culturally and temporally authentic to 1940s-1960s American context.

**YAML PROP POOLS:**

```yaml
american_life_props:
  work_tools: [typewriter, hard_hat, stethoscope, briefcase]
  cultural_items: [american_flag, baseball, vinyl_record, newspaper]
  period_technology: [rotary_phone, camera, radio, television]
```

**COHERENCE FILTER:** All elements support 1940s-1960s American photojournalistic authenticity; fallback = clean documentary scene.
