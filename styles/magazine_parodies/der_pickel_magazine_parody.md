## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Political satirical illustration with powerful visual metaphors over realistic portraiture.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("150 LPI halftone", "2-3mm ink spread") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Authentic sheetfed offset lithography supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Material Physics Authority:** Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Use 1956-1990s printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `painterly-contour` (political caricature with commissioned illustration authenticity)
- **Pose Flag:** `confrontational-portraiture` (direct engagement for journalistic authority)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (optimize for A4 magazine format)
- **Red Border Mandate:** Iconic SPIEGEL red border completely encasing cover image - NO exceptions
- **Font Authentication Authority:** "DER PICKEL" masthead must use bold white sans-serif letterforms matching original - NO font variations permitted
- **Political Satirical Illustration Mandate:** Commissioned illustration with powerful visual metaphors, not photography
- **Subject Regeneration Authority:** Subject's face, expression, pose, and environmental interaction must be completely regenerated to authentically portray the specific scenario described in the headline
- **Headline-Subject Integration Mandate:** Subject's actions, facial expressions, and body language must reflect and illustrate the absurd scenario in the generated headline
- **Dynamic Headline Authority:** Headlines generated contextually based on desired satirical political scenario, with subject regenerated to match that narrative
- **Satirical Tone Authority:** Provocative, confrontational, and boldly satirical content with intelligent political commentary
- **Visual Metaphor Authority:** Complex political ideas conveyed through symbolic imagery and allegorical staging
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes - headlines essential for political commentary.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; parody masthead "DER PICKEL" only.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters; surface must exhibit authentic 1956-1990s sheetfed offset characteristics with visible texture.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas except mandatory red border; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
