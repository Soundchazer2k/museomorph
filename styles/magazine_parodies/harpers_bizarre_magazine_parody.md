**Version:** 4.2
 **Purpose:** A comprehensive framework for creating authentic Harper's Bazaar parody covers using "Harper's Bizarre" as the IP-safe masthead, enforcing Brodovitch-era revolutionary fashion photography with bizarre/humorous elements and period-appropriate production methods.

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Revolutionary fashion photography with cinematic flow over static studio portraiture.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("150 LPI halftone", "asymmetrical placement 70% offset") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Authentic Brodovitch experimental techniques supersede digital appearance descriptions.
- **Material Physics Authority:** Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Use 1934-1958 lithography methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `diffusion-soft` (fashion photography with dynamic movement and vitality)
- **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` (action shots with spontaneous, ordinary activities and natural movement)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (optimize for dual-page spread cinematic flow)
- **Masthead Authority:** "HARPER'S BIZARRE" must use serif letterforms matching Harper's Bazaar classical style - add "MEN" designation ONLY for male subjects, NO "MEN" text for female subjects - NO font variations permitted
- **Fashion Photography Mandate:** Revolutionary fashion photography with dynamic movement, not static studio poses
- **Subject Regeneration Authority:** Subject's appearance, expression, and bizarre interaction must be completely regenerated to authentically portray the specific surreal fashion scenario described in the concept
- **Bizarre-Fashion Integration Mandate:** Subject's actions, fashion styling, and environmental staging must reflect and illustrate the absurd high-fashion scenario with sophisticated weirdness
- **Dynamic Bizarre Authority:** Concepts generated contextually based on desired fashion-meets-surreal scenario, with subject regenerated to match that narrative
- **Revolutionary Tone Authority:** Sophisticated fashion authority with deliberate bizarre elements and avant-garde sensibility
- **Cinematic Context Authority:** Dual-page spread mentality with flowing, dynamic composition essential for visual storytelling
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes - fashion headlines with bizarre twist essential.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; parody masthead "HARPER'S BIZARRE" only.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters; surface must exhibit authentic 1934-1958 lithography characteristics with period texture.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
