# Marc Silvestri Style

## 🔧 Artist-Specific Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Dynamic energy flow over anatomical precision; radiating composition authority supersedes geometric structure **Face-Treatment Flag:** `high-contrast-detail` with `piercing-eye-emphasis` characteristics and dramatic lighting integration **Pose Flag:** `explosive-dynamic` with solar plexus radiation patterns and multi-directional action priority **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` for atmospheric color integration and energy manifestation requirements **Material Physics Authority:** Bold color separation simulation, high-contrast linework techniques, dramatic lighting applications with energy-radiating directional flow **Cultural/Period Authenticity:** 1990s Image Comics dynamic aesthetic, explosive composition philosophy, energy-radiating stroke direction methodology **Color Collaboration Method:** Glynis Oliver high-contrast separation technique, Brian Haberlin atmospheric digital integration, bold primary color authority **Technical Specifications:** Rich saturated color schemes, variable line weight hierarchy, solar plexus radiating compositions, form-following crosshatching patterns **Modern Age Innovation:** Dynamic energy comic aesthetics establishing explosive comic art, radiating composition mastery applied to superhero subjects **IP Protection:** Original character design avoiding existing Image Comics iconography, distinct costume elements, alternative dynamic themes **Safety Guardrails:** Age-appropriate content, modest attire for all figures, no copyrighted logos/signatures, dynamic artistic standards

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 📋 Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw ALL elements as **dynamic energy comic art** - NO photographic elements, NO digital effects. Transform the subject into a **generic original superhero** in **Marc Silvestri's explosive energy technique** for **exact Vertex Comics cover format**." **Gender Preservation Mandate:** MAINTAIN the subject's presented gender identity - if female subject, create female superhero; if male subject, create male superhero. **Dynamic Method Authority:** Use radiating energy composition with high-contrast technique - NO static positioning, NO energy-lacking corrections. **IP Safeguard:** Create original superhero character with completely distinct design (avoid all Image Comics iconography - NO Witchblade elements, NO Darkness references, NO Cyber Force designs, NO Top Cow character elements), unique dynamic heroic theme, alternative energy presentation - ZERO resemblance to Silvestri's established characters. **Illustration Authority:** ALL elements must follow Silvestri's dynamic technique - NO photographic portraits, NO digital rendering, NO static comic conventions. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **explosive heroic pose/dramatic expression/energy gesture**; integrate into **dynamic comic medium** emphasizing **radiating technique** and **energy flow mastery**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `high-contrast-detail` **Pose Flag:** `explosive-dynamic` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style dominance:** Silvestri's energy dynamics overrides all static comic approaches, prioritizing **radiating flow** and **explosive authenticity**. **Mode Selector:** Dynamic Energy Comic Cover with Vertex Comics branding.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**
