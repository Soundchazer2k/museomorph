## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix:**

- **Adult fem:** High-fashion superhero costumes with technical material specifications (metallic bodysuits, structured capes, engineered fabrics), 9-head proportion emphasis, fashion runway influence applied to heroic design
- **Adult masc:** Tailored superhero uniforms with precise fit and technical detail (fitted armor pieces, structured elements, engineered materials), fashion illustration proportions maintained
- **Youth:** Age-appropriate heroic costumes with fashion sensibility but modest coverage, technical detail appropriate to character age

**Fabric Behavior:**

- **Drape qualities:** Technical fabric simulation (neoprene stretch, metallic sheen, engineered textiles)
- **Material physics:** Digital rendering of high-tech costume materials with authentic fall and movement
- **Period accuracy:** Contemporary superhero costume design influenced by high-fashion methodology

**Accessory Guidelines:**

- **Minimalist (0-2):** Clean costume focus with 1-2 key technical elements
- **Elaborate (3-4):** Complex costume systems with multiple technical components and fashion details

**Color Palette:** Mathematical harmony schemes (triadic, complementary, split-complementary) with no arbitrary color selection, fashion-influenced sophistication

**Prop Selector:**

```yaml
vertex_dauterman_props:
  heroic_gear: [technical gauntlets, engineered weapons, high-tech accessories, costume components]

- **Technical Costume Priority:** Material specification clarity with measurable detail hierarchy - costume technical elements receive 10-15x detail concentration compared to background elements, fashion hardware gets 8-12x line density compared to anatomical areas
- **Precision Color Distribution:** Mathematical harmony implementation with measured percentages - primary color dominance 40-45%, secondary color support 30-35%, accent color punctuation 20-25%, ensuring geometric color wheel relationships maintained throughout composition
- **Enhanced Detail Management:** Costume technical specifications receive highest priority with UCLA costume design methodology - fabric junction points, hardware attachment systems, material transition zones all rendered with technical drawing precision

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Digital comic cover format with fashion illustration influence, contemporary production values
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Clean comic cover presentation without decorative frames, focus on character and costume design
- **Production Context Anchor:** Modern digital comic production with fashion industry methodology integration
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for 2:3 comic cover format, not adapted from different ratio
