about: >
  Todd McFarlane’s capes writhe like living smoke, with ink spatters and 200
  strands flinging across the frame. We keep that chaotic silhouette,
  exaggerated anatomy, and grungy textures while inventing new anti-heroes and
  void-drenched skylines.

# Todd McFarlane Style

## 🔧 Artist-Specific Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Organic flow authority over anatomical precision; cape dynamics supersede realistic physics **Face-Treatment Flag:** `linear-anatomical-destruction` with `scratched-surface` texture emphasis
 **Pose Flag:** `contorted-psychological` with extreme foreshortening and impossible anatomy **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` for cape dynamics and organic flow requirements **Material Physics Authority:** Newsprint absorption characteristics, brush-loaded single strokes, variable ink viscosity for texture simulation **Cultural/Period Authenticity:** Early 1990s Image Comics revolution methods, independent creator aesthetic, anti-establishment art approach **Revolutionary Cape Technique:** Spaghetti webbing methodology - 200+ individual strand calculations per cape panel with three-line construction system **Technical Specifications:** Nearly-dry brush stippling, 30-degree angular variance tolerance, organic chaos over geometric precision **Modern Age Innovation:** Extreme anatomical destruction establishing new visual language, cape physics redefinition, texture obsession methodology **IP Protection:** Original anti-hero character design avoiding existing supernatural iconography, distinct costume elements, alternative demonic themes **Safety Guardrails:** Age-appropriate content despite dark themes, modest attire for all figures, no copyrighted logos/signatures

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 📋 Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject as a **generic original supernatural anti-hero** in **Todd McFarlane's organic chaos technique** for **exact Vertex Comics cover format**." **IP Safeguard:** Create original dark character with completely distinct design (avoid all Spawn iconography - NO skull imagery, NO chain motifs, NO red cape combinations, NO demonic helmet designs), unique supernatural theme, alternative dark powers - ZERO resemblance to Spawn universe or Image Comics properties. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **contorted dramatic pose/supernatural intensity/anti-hero stance**; integrate into **organic chaos comic medium** emphasizing **impossible anatomy** and **flowing textile dynamics**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `linear-anatomical-destruction` **Pose Flag:** `contorted-psychological` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style dominance:** McFarlane's organic chaos overrides all realistic approaches, prioritizing **flowing dynamics** and **anatomical impossibility**. **Mode Selector:** Supernatural Anti-Hero Comic Cover with Vertex Comics branding.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (classic comic book cover - primary choice)
- **3:4** (alternative comic proportion)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with flowing cape/textile dynamics requiring extra composition space
- **Spatial Allocation:** Character dominance 50-60%, cape/flow effects 25-30%, texture demonstration 10-15%, typography zones 10-15%
- **Background Treatment:** Simplified environments allowing cape dynamics and organic flow to dominate visual space
- **Format Justification:** Comic cover requires flowing composition for cape physics demonstration with integrated supernatural atmosphere
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Todd McFarlane's revolutionary organic style (1987-present) established **anatomical destruction aesthetics** through **impossible cape physics** and **texture obsession mastery**. Production method emphasizes **newsprint-optimized technique** with **single-stroke brush economy**, **organic chaos construction**, and **anti-establishment visual storytelling with supernatural themes**. **Paper substrate:** **Standard newsprint with heavy ink absorption** creating **bold texture contrast effects**. Purpose focuses on **anti-hero supernatural drama** through **impossible physics demonstration** and **organic visual storytelling** within **independent comic production**.

**Hallmark motifs include:**

- **200+ individual cape strand calculations** per panel using **three-line construction system** (structural wavy lines, flow direction lines, gravitational pull lines)
- **30-degree angular variance** from primary flow direction with **organic unpredictability**
- **120-180% anatomical exaggeration** beyond natural proportions for dramatic effect
- **Variable texture density** from **5-50 lines per inch** based on material simulation requirements
- **40-60% negative space usage** in cape areas defined by **absence rather than presence of ink**
- **Stippling technique** with **2-8mm dot diameter variation** applied with **nearly-dry brush method**

**Period framing:** **Early 1990s Image Comics revolution** with **independent creator freedom** creating **anti-establishment but commercially successful entertainment**.

**Innovation line:** **Cape physics revolution** / **Anatomical destruction mastery** / **Organic texture obsession** / **McFarlane's impossible anatomy authorization**.
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Organic Flow Mechanics:** **Three-line cape system** with **structural foundation lines** (wavy pattern defining cape base), **flow direction lines** (indicating movement), and **gravitational pull lines** (showing physical forces). **30-degree maximum angular variance** from primary flow direction. **200+ individual strand calculations** for complex cape panels.

**Anatomical Specifications:** **120-180% limb extension** beyond natural proportions. **Contorted poses** with **psychological tension emphasis**. **Impossible joint angles** and **gravity-defying anatomy** for dramatic impact. **Muscle definition** following **organic chaos rather than realistic anatomy**.

**Texture Application:** **Variable density from 5-50 lines per inch** depending on material simulation. **Stippling technique** using **2-8mm dot diameter variation** with **nearly-dry brush application**. **Crosshatching chaos** with **organic directional flow** rather than geometric patterns.

**Negative Space Authority:** **40-60% of cape definition** achieved through **strategic ink absence**. **Flowing forms** created by **what is not drawn** rather than positive line work. **Organic boundaries** defined by **texture contrast** rather than outline containment.

**Line Quality:** **Single-stroke brush economy** with **organic unpredictability**. **Scratched surface effects** and **texture emphasis** over clean line work. **Variable ink viscosity** creating **surface interaction authenticity**.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Comic cover composition optimized for **2:3 format** with **cape dynamics showcase** and **organic flow demonstration**.
