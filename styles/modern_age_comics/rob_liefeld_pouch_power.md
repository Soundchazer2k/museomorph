# Rob Liefeld Style

## 🔧 Artist-Specific Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Dynamic impact over anatomical accuracy; poster aesthetics supersede technical precision **Face-Treatment Flag:** `poster-ink` with high-contrast spotting and simplified rendering **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` with extreme muscular emphasis and heroic positioning **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` for character dominance and poster composition **Material Physics Authority:** Marker-based techniques, high-contrast ink spotting, Bristol paper tooth utilization for bold graphic effects **Cultural/Period Authenticity:** Early 1990s Image Comics revolution methods, anti-establishment aesthetic, emphasis on visual impact over technical refinement **Proportional System:** Exaggerated mesomorph body types, 6.5-head system with enlarged torso emphasis, poster-heroic proportions **Technical Specifications:** Limited crosshatching economy, high-contrast color blocking, simplified environmental backgrounds **Modern Age Innovation:** Extreme proportional exaggeration establishing new heroic archetype, poster-style comic aesthetics **IP Protection:** Original action hero character design avoiding existing superhero iconography, distinct costume elements, alternative color schemes **Safety Guardrails:** Age-appropriate content, modest attire for all figures, no copyrighted logos/signatures

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 📋 Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw ALL elements as **fully illustrated comic art** - NO photographic elements anywhere. Transform the subject into a **generic original action character** in **Rob Liefeld's bold poster technique** for **exact Vertex Comics cover format**." **Gender Preservation Mandate:** MAINTAIN the subject's presented gender identity - if female subject, create female action character; if male subject, create male action character. **IP Safeguard:** Create original action character with completely distinct design (avoid all X-Force iconography - NO cable harnesses, NO futuristic weapons, NO militaristic designs, NO pouches/straps combinations), unique heroic theme, alternative power demonstration - ZERO resemblance to X-Force universe or Image Comics properties. **Illustration Authority:** ALL figures must follow Liefeld's illustrated style - NO photographic portraits, NO realistic photography elements. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **extreme power pose/heroic confidence/action-ready stance**; integrate into **poster-style comic medium** emphasizing **visual impact** and **heroic presence**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `poster-ink` **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Style dominance:** Liefeld's poster impact overrides technical precision, prioritizing **visual dynamics** and **heroic character mass**. **Mode Selector:** Action Hero Comic Cover with Vertex Comics branding.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (classic comic book cover - primary choice)
- **3:4** (alternative comic proportion)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with character mass dominance occupying 70-85% of composition space
- **Spatial Allocation:** Character dominance 70-85%, action demonstration 10-15%, typography zones 10-15%, background 5-10%
- **Background Treatment:** Minimal environmental detail allowing character mass to dominate visual impact
- **Format Justification:** Comic cover requires poster-style layout for newsstand impact with character-focused composition
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Rob Liefeld's revolutionary poster style (1989-present) established **extreme heroic proportions** through **visual impact prioritization** and **poster comic aesthetics**. Production method emphasizes **marker-based foundation** with **high-contrast ink application**, **simplified rendering techniques**, and **action-oriented visual storytelling with maximum character presence**. **Paper substrate:** **Bristol board with marker absorption** creating **bold contrast poster effects**. Purpose focuses on **heroic wish-fulfillment** through **extreme power demonstration** and **poster visual storytelling** within **high-impact comic production**.

**Hallmark motifs include:**

- **200-300% chest expansion** beyond natural proportions for heroic emphasis
- **Limited crosshatching** with **5-15 strokes maximum per shadow area** and **inconsistent directional flow**
- **Feet avoidance strategies** with **diamond-shape substitutions** in **60% of full-figure drawings**
- **Line quality limitations** with **thick-to-thin variation limited to 1:3 ratio** and **minimal feathering technique**
- **Background reduction** with **70% of compositions featuring minimal environmental detail** focusing on **character mass emphasis**
- **6.5-head proportional system** with **enlarged torso dominance** and **heroic mass concentration**

**Period framing:** **Early 1990s Image Comics revolution** with **anti-establishment heroic ideals** creating **visually impactful but technically simplified entertainment**.

**Innovation line:** **Extreme proportional heroism** / **Poster comic aesthetics mastery** / **Visual impact prioritization** / **Liefeld's heroic mass emphasis**.
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Proportional Specifications:** **200-300% chest expansion** beyond natural anatomy. **6.5-head proportional system** with **enlarged torso emphasis**. **Muscular mass concentration** in **chest and shoulder areas** with **simplified limb construction**.

**Line Quality Limitations:** **Thick-to-thin variation limited to 1:3 ratio** maximum range. **Minimal feathering technique** with **bold outline emphasis**. **Simplified construction** avoiding complex curve work or detailed rendering.

**Crosshatching Economy:** **5-15 strokes maximum per shadow area** with **inconsistent directional flow**. **Basic shadow placement** without complex form modeling. **High-contrast ink spotting** rather than graduated shading techniques.

**Feet Management Protocol:** **Diamond-shape substitution technique** for **60% of full-figure compositions**. **Strategic cropping** or **off-panel positioning** to **avoid detailed foot rendering**. **Focus redirection** to **upper body mass and heroic proportions**.

**Background Reduction Authority:** **70% of composition space** dedicated to **character mass presentation**. **Minimal environmental detail** with **simplified geometric shapes** or **solid color backgrounds**. **Character prominence** supersedes **environmental context**.

**Color Application:** **High-contrast poster techniques** with **bold primary color relationships**. **Simplified shading** using **flat color blocking** rather than **graduated rendering**. **Marker-based color logic** with **Bristol paper interaction**.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Comic cover composition optimized for **2:3 format** with **character mass showcase** and **poster visual impact**.
