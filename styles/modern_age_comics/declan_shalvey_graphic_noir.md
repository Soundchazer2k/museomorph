# Declan Shalvey Style

## 🔧 Artist-Specific Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Storytelling clarity authority supersedes decorative detail; strategic line placement overrides comprehensive rendering **Face-Treatment Flag:** `minimalist-line` with `strategic-negative-space` characteristics and narrative function integration **Pose Flag:** `narrative-function` with storytelling priority and character essence emphasis **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` for compositional focus requirements and visual clarity showcase **Material Physics Authority:** Ink wash techniques, single-take brush economy, strategic line placement methodology with maximum impact through minimal means **Cultural/Period Authenticity:** Irish storytelling precision, minimalist efficiency philosophy, narrative clarity with emotional resonance **Technical Specifications:** 60% line reduction from standard density, strategic negative space usage, single ink wash applications, storytelling-first composition **Minimalist Innovation:** Maximum impact through strategic line economy establishing efficient comic aesthetics, storytelling clarity mastery applied to superhero subjects **IP Protection:** Original character design avoiding existing Marvel/DC iconography, distinct narrative themes, alternative storytelling presentation **Safety Guardrails:** Age-appropriate content, modest attire for all figures, no copyrighted logos/signatures, minimalist artistic standards

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
