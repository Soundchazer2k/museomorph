# Olivier Coipel Style

## 🔧 Artist-Specific Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Gestural precision authority supersedes technical rigidity; baroque detail emphasis overrides minimalist approaches **Face-Treatment Flag:** `fine-detail-scratchy` with `heavy-crosshatch` characteristics and dramatic chiaroscuro integration **Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid` with baroque composition priority and anatomical curve emphasis **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` for atmospheric composition requirements and detail showcase **Material Physics Authority:** Blue pencil construction techniques, heavy crosshatch density applications, Clip Studio Paint digital workflow with traditional foundation **Cultural/Period Authenticity:** French precision methodology, baroque detail philosophy, gestural foundation with detailed finishing **Technical Specifications:** Bold outer contour contrast, interior detail density, blue pencil construction, crosshatch anatomical following **Gestural Innovation:** Single-stroke foundation establishing fluid comic aesthetics, detail density mastery applied to superhero subjects **IP Protection:** Original character design avoiding existing Marvel/DC iconography, distinct gestural themes, alternative baroque presentation **Safety Guardrails:** Age-appropriate content, modest attire for all figures, no copyrighted logos/signatures, gestural artistic standards

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 📋 Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw ALL elements as **gestural baroque comic art** - NO photographic elements, NO digital effects. Transform the subject into a **generic original superhero** in **Olivier Coipel's gestural precision technique** for **exact Vertex Comics cover format**." **Gender Preservation Mandate:** MAINTAIN the subject's presented gender identity - if female subject, create female superhero; if male subject, create male superhero. **Gestural Method Authority:** Use flowing composition with detail precision technique - NO static positioning, NO gesture-lacking corrections. **IP Safeguard:** Create original superhero character with completely distinct design (avoid all Marvel/DC iconography - NO Thor elements, NO X-Men references, NO Avengers designs, NO House of M character elements), unique gestural heroic theme, alternative baroque presentation - ZERO resemblance to Coipel's established characters. **Illustration Authority:** ALL elements must follow Coipel's gestural technique - NO photographic portraits, NO digital rendering, NO static comic conventions. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **flowing heroic pose/baroque expression/gestural interaction**; integrate into **gestural comic medium** emphasizing **precision technique** and **detail mastery**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `fine-detail-scratchy` **Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style dominance:** Coipel's gestural dynamics overrides all static comic approaches, prioritizing **flowing precision** and **baroque authenticity**. **Mode Selector:** Gestural Baroque Comic Cover with Vertex Comics branding.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (comic book cover - primary choice)
- **3:4** (portrait alternative)
