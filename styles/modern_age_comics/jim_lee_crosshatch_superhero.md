# Jim Lee Style

## üîß Artist-Specific Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Technical measurement authority supersedes descriptive language; crosshatch precision over stylistic approximation **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` with `oil-fat-over-lean` layering precision **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` with anatomical elongation specifications (150% neck thickness, 8.5-head system) **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` for dynamic comic composition with character dominance **Material Physics Authority:** Strathmore Bristol board substrate, crow quill nibs 102-108, India ink binding agents, 2-3mm impasto equivalent through crosshatching density **Cultural/Period Authenticity:** 1990s Image Comics production methods with offset printing registration tolerances, newsprint absorption characteristics **Technical Specifications:** F-lead pencils for construction, drybrush technique for mid-tone areas, Pentel correction fluid for highlight definition **Modern Age Innovation:** Precise anatomical construction with commercial appeal, crosshatch mastery establishing industry standard **IP Protection:** Original character design avoiding existing superhero iconography, distinct costume elements, alternative color schemes **Safety Guardrails:** Age-appropriate content, modest attire for all figures, no copyrighted logos/signatures

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1‚Üí8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## üìã Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject as a **generic original superhero** in **Jim Lee's precise crosshatch technique** for **exact Vertex Comics cover format**." **IP Safeguard:** Create original superhero character with completely distinct costume design (avoid all existing Marvel/DC iconography), unique chest symbol, alternative color scheme - ZERO resemblance to X-Men, Justice League, or any copyrighted properties. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **heroic power pose/confident expression/dynamic superhero stance**; integrate into **Modern Age comic medium** emphasizing **crosshatch precision** and **anatomical mastery**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Style dominance:** Jim Lee's crosshatch precision overrides all other comic approaches, prioritizing **technical line mastery** and **heroic character impact**. **Mode Selector:** Modern Age Superhero Comic Cover with Vertex Comics branding.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (classic comic book cover - primary choice)

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with superhero prominence occupying 70-85% vertical space
- **Spatial Allocation:** Character dominance 70-85%, action elements 10-15%, typography zones 10-15%, background 5-10%
- **Background Treatment:** Simplified urban/heroic environments that support character without competition
- **Format Justification:** Comic cover requires vertical emphasis for newsstand visibility with integrated superhero positioning and typography zones

Production method emphasizes **Bristol board foundation** with **crow quill precision**, **layered crosshatch construction**, and **commercial superhero storytelling with technical excellence**. **Paper substrate:** **Strathmore Bristol board with smooth surface preparation** creating **precise line reproduction**. Purpose focuses on **superhero wish-fulfillment** through **heroic power demonstration** and **commercial visual storytelling** within **premium comic production**.

**Hallmark motifs include:**

- **15-20 crosshatch strokes per square inch** in shadow areas with **tapered 2mm to 0.2mm thickness variation**
- **150% neck thickness relative to classical standards** using **8.5-head proportional system**
- **Anatomical elongation** with **muscle definition following directional flow**
- **Character occupies 70-85% of vertical canvas space** in portrait orientations
- **Parallel crosshatch lines at 45-degree angles** with **3-5mm spacing, doubled for deeper shadows**

**Period framing:** **1990s Modern Age comic revolution** with **Image Comics production values** creating **technically sophisticated but commercially accessible entertainment**.

**Innovation line:** **Crosshatch technique mastery** / **Anatomical precision standardization** / **Commercial superhero perfection** / **Bristol board crow quill optimization**.
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Quality:** **Precise crosshatch weights** at **2.0-3.0 pt** for **character outlines** with **tapered construction** from **2mm to 0.2mm thickness**. **15-20 crosshatch strokes per square inch** in shadow areas with **parallel line construction at 45-degree angles**. **Crosshatch spacing:** **3-5mm between lines, doubled for deeper shadow values**. **Tool marks:** **Crow quill nib precision** with **Bristol board tooth interaction** creating **clean line definition**.

**Anatomical Specifications:** **150% neck thickness** compared to classical proportions, **8.5-head proportional system** with **elongated limb construction**. **Muscle definition:** **Crosshatch follows anatomical curve patterns** with **directional flow emphasis**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Character extremities receive 3-5x line density** compared to torso areas.

**Color Registration:** **Offset printing tolerances ¬±0.5mm** for period authenticity. **Four-color process** with **newsprint absorption characteristics**. **Halftone specifications:** **133 LPI for coated stock** or **85 LPI for newsprint** reproduction.

**Surface Preparation:** **Bristol board substrate** with **F-lead pencil construction lines**. **Blue pencil foundation** visible in **80% of construction areas**. **India ink application** over **cleaned pencil work**.

**Production Method:** **Drybrush technique** for mid-tone areas, **Pentel correction fluid** for highlight definition, **crosshatch density variation** for form modeling.
