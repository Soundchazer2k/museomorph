# Peach Momoko Style

## üîß Artist-Specific Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Watercolor fluidity authority supersedes linear precision; bish≈çjo aesthetic integration overrides traditional comic conventions **Face-Treatment Flag:** `watercolor-soft` with `bishojo-aesthetic` characteristics and Japanese folklore integration **Pose Flag:** `cultural-traditional` with Japanese folktale influence and adolescent struggle emphasis **Canvas Control Flag:** `format-native` for painterly composition requirements and paper texture showcase **Material Physics Authority:** Traditional watercolor and ink applications, paper tooth interaction visibility, porcelain brush holder precision, 4-page batch processing for color consistency **Cultural/Period Authenticity:** Japanese subculture influences, Studio Ghibli inspiration integration, Momoko-verse folktale methodology with horror-beauty balance **Technical Specifications:** 3-4 watercolor layer applications, 70% paper texture visibility, natural bristle brush marks, 30-50% unpainted paper white definition **Japanese Horror-Beauty Innovation:** Cute/grotesque juxtaposition establishing unique comic aesthetics, adolescent struggle storytelling applied to superhero subjects **IP Protection:** Original character design avoiding existing Marvel iconography, distinct folktale themes, alternative Japanese presentation **Safety Guardrails:** Age-appropriate content, modest attire for all figures, no copyrighted logos/signatures, watercolor artistic standards

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1‚Üí8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## üìã Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw ALL elements as **Japanese watercolor folklore comic art** - NO photographic elements, NO digital effects. Transform the subject into a **generic original superhero** in **Peach Momoko's watercolor-manga technique** for **exact Vertex Comics cover format**." **Gender Preservation Mandate:** MAINTAIN the subject's presented gender identity - if female subject, create female superhero; if male subject, create male superhero. **Watercolor Method Authority:** Use flowing painterly composition with cultural authenticity technique - NO linear rigidity, NO texture-lacking corrections. **IP Safeguard:** Create original superhero character with completely distinct design (avoid all Marvel iconography - NO X-Men elements, NO Demon Days references, NO Ultimate designs, NO Marvel character elements), unique Japanese-inspired heroic theme, alternative folklore presentation - ZERO resemblance to Momoko's established characters. **Illustration Authority:** ALL elements must follow Momoko's watercolor technique - NO photographic portraits, NO digital rendering, NO linear comic conventions. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **flowing heroic pose/cultural expression/folktale gesture**; integrate into **watercolor comic medium** emphasizing **fluidity technique** and **cultural mastery**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `watercolor-soft` **Pose Flag:** `cultural-traditional` **Canvas Control Flag:** `format-native` **Style dominance:** Momoko's watercolor dynamics overrides all linear comic approaches, prioritizing **painterly flow** and **cultural authenticity**. **Mode Selector:** Japanese Watercolor Folklore Comic Cover with Vertex Comics branding.
