about: >
  Mike Mignola reduces worlds to black slabs, blood-red highlights, and knotted
  folklore icons. His covers are like woodcuts lit by a single match. We echo
  that stark drama with new cryptids, artifacts, and negative-space
  storytelling.

# Mike Mignola Style

## üîß Mike Mignola Artist-Specific Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Atmospheric mood authority over anatomical detail, shadow architecture supersedes line dependency **Face-Treatment Flag:** `geometric-shadow` with `minimal-render` characteristics **Pose Flag:** `gothic-static` with architectural weight and folkloric presence **Canvas Control Flag:** `format-native` for shadow composition requirements and chiaroscuro showcase **Material Physics Authority:** India ink on Bristol board substrate, heavy shadow massing priority, geometric shape conversion system, minimalist rendering philosophy **Shadow Architecture:** 70-90% of visual information conveyed through black shape relationships rather than linear work, compositional weight supersedes realistic light source logic **Gothic Minimalism Method:** Line economy reduction (80% fewer strokes than standard comic density), angular conversion of organic curves, deliberate negative space authority **Chiaroscuro Philosophy:** Everything emerging from darkness, sublime power of unseen elements, dramatic light-dark contrast as primary storytelling tool

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1‚Üí8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## üìã Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Mike Mignola gothic minimalism methodology** for **modern comic cover specification**.
- Identity via silhouette/gesture/folkloric expression through shadow architecture.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original Vertex Comics character designs avoiding copyrighted elements appropriate to gothic horror style, distinct from Hellboy/BPRD universe elements.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `geometric-shadow`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `gothic-static`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `format-native`
- **Style Dominance:** Mignola's shadow architecture and minimalist approach supersedes all linear comic conventions, prioritizing **atmospheric mood** and **geometric shape relationships**.
- **Mode Selector:** Gothic Horror Comic Cover

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `2:3` (comic book cover format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** format-native with shadow composition requiring atmospheric depth construction
- **Spatial Allocation:** Shadow dominance 70-90%, figure integration 40-60%, negative space utilization 30-50%, minimal detail zones concentrated in 10-20% of composition
- **Background Treatment:** Heavy chiaroscuro environments that support shadow architecture without diminishing atmospheric weight
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 ratio serves gothic horror vertical emphasis with dramatic shadow distribution and folkloric storytelling hierarchy

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** German Expressionist films, Jack Kirby dynamic power, Frank Frazetta compositional strength, Gothic literature (Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard), folklore and mythology, architectural decay aesthetics
- **Medium/Production method:** India ink on Bristol board with heavy shadow massing technique, geometric shape conversion system, minimalist rendering philosophy with deliberate line economy
- **Thematic purpose:** Gothic horror storytelling through atmospheric mood, folkloric narrative emphasis, supernatural/occult subject matter with blue-collar heroic sensibility
- **3-5 hallmark motifs:**
  - **60-80% black area coverage** with solid shadow shapes defining compositional weight
  - **80% line reduction** compared to standard comic density, pure shape definition authority
  - **Angular conversion system:** All organic curves reduced to 3-5 geometric segments maximum
  - **Color limitation protocol:** Maximum 3 colors including black and white, with collaborative colorist integration (Dave Stewart methodology)
  - **Gothic architecture integration:** Ruined buildings, maritime settings, crumbling stonework with dramatic shadow play
- **Period framing:** Contemporary gothic horror comics (1990s-present) with folkloric timelessness and occult detective tradition
- **Tone Tag:** Dark-atmospheric with folkloric gravitas

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Shadow Mass Authority:** 60-80% composition area coverage in solid black shapes, visual information conveyed through black shape interaction rather than linear detail, compositional weight placement superseding realistic light source logic
- **Line Economy Reduction:** 80% fewer strokes than standard comic approach, geometric angularity conversion of all organic curves to 3-5 segment maximum, clean deliberate strokes without corrections or sketchy rendering
- **Geometric Conversion Anchor:** Transform all curved organic forms into angular approximations with maximum 3-5 segments per curve, maintain architectural weight and folkloric presence through shape relationship
- **Color Mathematics Protocol:** Maximum 3 colors per composition including black and white, collaborative integration with period-appropriate colorist methodology (Dave Stewart influence), atmospheric mood emphasis over color complexity
- **India Ink Physics:** Heavy mass application technique on Bristol board substrate, no feathering or gradation effects, pure shape definition with solid black areas and clean white negative space
- **Pose Anchors:** Gothic-static positioning with architectural stability over dynamic action, folkloric gesture economy with supernatural presence emphasis, weight distribution emphasizing ground connection and mythic authority
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Proportional measurements following folkloric storytelling logic rather than anatomical precision, emphasis on silhouette clarity and atmospheric integration
- **Material Authenticity Anchor:** Traditional India ink techniques with authentic Bristol board interaction, no digital simulation of traditional media effects
- **Period Consistency Anchor:** Contemporary gothic horror comic production with folkloric timelessness, occult detective tradition integration
- **Production Method Anchor:** Hand-drawn ink work with collaborative colorist integration, traditional comic production methods
- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 2:3 gothic horror comic format with shadow architecture showcase and atmospheric storytelling emphasis

------
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix:**

- **Adult figures:** Gothic period clothing with folkloric elements (long coats, practical adventuring gear, occult investigator attire), architectural weight in costume design, minimal accessory complexity
- **Supernatural beings:** Folkloric creature design with geometric shape emphasis, shadow integration priority, mythological accuracy with Mignola's angular conversion system
- **Period clothing:** Early-to-mid 20th century adventuring gear, occult investigator aesthetics, practical working clothes with gothic atmosphere

**Fabric Behavior:**

- **Heavy drape qualities:** Wool coats, leather gear, practical materials with architectural fall and shadow-casting properties
- **Gothic texture emphasis:** Stone, metal, aged materials with strong shadow-throwing characteristics
- **Period accuracy:** 1940s-1950s adventuring and investigative gear, folklore-appropriate traditional clothing

**Color Palette:** Maximum 3-color limitation with black-white foundation, earth tones (browns, grays, muted blues), atmospheric color schemes supporting shadow architecture
