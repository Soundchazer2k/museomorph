# Jorge Jim√©nez Style

## üîß Artist-Specific Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Dynamic energy authority supersedes anatomical precision; manga-influenced storytelling overrides traditional comic conventions **Face-Treatment Flag:** `digital-brush-variety` with `manga-influence` characteristics and shonen storytelling integration **Pose Flag:** `kinetic-energy` with extreme dynamism priority and "great actors in a movie" performance emphasis **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` for motion emphasis requirements and energy showcase **Material Physics Authority:** Clip Studio Paint digital brushes, Wacom pen tablet workflow, flat brush texturing with 8-12 different brush types per finished piece **Cultural/Period Authenticity:** Spanish-American comic fusion, manga-anime influences integrated with DC house style, digital-first production methodology **Technical Specifications:** 2-5mm intentional line jitter variation, 30-40% flat brush shadow rendering, extreme anatomical exaggeration in action, silhouette clarity with internal texture chaos **Digital-Manga Innovation:** American-Japanese fusion establishing dynamic comic aesthetics, performance-based character acting applied to superhero subjects **IP Protection:** Original character design avoiding existing DC iconography, distinct dynamic themes, alternative energy presentation **Safety Guardrails:** Age-appropriate content, modest attire for all figures, no copyrighted logos/signatures, kinetic artistic standards

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1‚Üí8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## üìã Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw ALL elements as **dynamic manga-influenced comic art** - NO photographic elements, NO digital effects. Transform the subject into a **generic original superhero** in **Jorge Jim√©nez's kinetic fusion technique** for **exact Vertex Comics cover format**." **Gender Preservation Mandate:** MAINTAIN the subject's presented gender identity - if female subject, create female superhero; if male subject, create male superhero. **Kinetic Method Authority:** Use extreme dynamic energy with performance-based technique - NO static positioning, NO energy-lacking corrections. **IP Safeguard:** Create original superhero character with completely distinct design (avoid all DC/Marvel iconography - NO Superman elements, NO Batman references, NO Justice League designs, NO DC character elements), unique kinetic heroic theme, alternative dynamic presentation - ZERO resemblance to Jim√©nez's established characters. **Illustration Authority:** ALL elements must follow Jim√©nez's manga-fusion technique - NO photographic portraits, NO digital rendering, NO static comic conventions. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **kinetic heroic pose/performance expression/dynamic gesture**; integrate into **manga-fusion comic medium** emphasizing **energy technique** and **performance mastery**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `digital-brush-variety` **Pose Flag:** `kinetic-energy` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style dominance:** Jim√©nez's kinetic dynamics overrides all static comic approaches, prioritizing **energy flow** and **performance authenticity**. **Mode Selector:** Kinetic Manga-Fusion Comic Cover with Vertex Comics branding.
