## Carmine Infantino Style - Dynamic Silver Age Comics Framework

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject as a **generic original speed-powered hero** in **Carmine Infantino's dynamic Silver Age style** for **exact Vertex Comics cover format**." **IP Safeguard:** Create original speedster character with completely distinct costume design (NO lightning bolt symbols, NO red/yellow combinations, NO Flash costume elements, NO Barry Allen references), unique speed theme, and alternative power visualization - ZERO resemblance to Flash universe. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **dynamic speed pose/geometric motion lines/Silver Age heroic stance**; integrate into **commercial art influenced comic medium** emphasizing **geometric precision** and **dynamic motion graphics**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `poster-ink` with **commercial art precision** **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` with **dynamic speed** **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Style dominance:** Infantino's geometric precision overrides rough comic art, prioritizing **commercial art clarity** and **dynamic motion design**. **Mode Selector:** Dynamic Speed Hero Comic with Vertex Comics branding.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (classic comic book cover - primary choice)
- **3:4** (Silver Age proportion - alternative)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with dynamic speed hero prominence and geometric motion environments
- **Spatial Allocation:** Hero dominance 55-65%, speed effects/motion lines 20-25%, typography zones 10-15%, background 5-10%
- **Background Treatment:** Clean, geometric environments that support speed themes with commercial art influences
- **Format Justification:** Comic cover requires dynamic layout for speed appeal with integrated motion graphics
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity
