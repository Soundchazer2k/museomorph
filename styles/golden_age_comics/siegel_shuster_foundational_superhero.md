## Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster Style - Foundational Superhero Iconography

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject as a **generic original superhero** in **Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster's foundational comic book style** for **exact Nano Comics cover format**." **IP Safeguard:** Create original superhero character with distinct costume design, unique symbol, and different color scheme - avoid any resemblance to existing DC/Marvel properties. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **heroic power pose/confident expression/iconic superhero stance**; integrate into **Golden Age comic book medium** emphasizing **simple but revolutionary visual language**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `poster-ink` with **four-color halftone dots** **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Style dominance:** Siegel & Shuster's foundational approach overrides modern comic conventions, prioritizing **bold simplicity** and **immediate heroic impact**. **Mode Selector:** Comic Book Cover with Nano Comics branding.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (classic comic book cover - primary choice)
- **3:4** (Golden Age proportion - alternative)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with comic cover layout requirements
- **Spatial Allocation:** Hero dominance 50-60%, typography zones 15-20%, background 25-30%
- **Background Treatment:** Simple urban environments with space for masthead and cover text
- **Format Justification:** Comic book cover tradition requires vertical emphasis for newsstand visibility with integrated typography
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's revolutionary approach (1938-1945) established **the visual language of superhero comics** through **foundational iconography** and **bold simplicity**. Production method emphasizes **cheap newsprint printing** with **four-color halftone process**, **visible registration marks**, and **color separation artifacts**. **Paper substrate:** **Rough newsprint texture** with **ink absorption creating slight color bleeding**. Purpose focuses on **heroic inspiration** through **power demonstration** and **moral authority visualization** within **affordable comic book format**. Hallmark motifs include **power poses with objects lifted overhead**, **cape billowing for dramatic effect**, **confident facial expressions showing determination**, **bold costume design with chest symbols**, and **urban crisis scenarios requiring superhero intervention**. Period framing encompasses **Depression-era hope** with **working-class heroic ideals** creating **aspirational but accessible characters**.

**Innovation line:** **Four-color printing mastery** / **Comic book cover format standardization** / **Newsprint optimization techniques** / **Siegel-Shuster creative partnership**.
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Bold, confident weights** at **2.0-3.0 pt** for **character outlines** with **clean, simple construction** and **minimal detail complexity**. **Halftone dot patterns** visible at **65-85 LPI** for **authentic newsprint reproduction**. **Color:** **Four-color process limitations** with **primary color dominance** at **85-95% saturation**. **Registration slightly off** showing **cyan/magenta/yellow/black separation**. **Newsprint color bleeding** creating **soft edge artifacts**. **Texture:** **Newsprint paper grain** with **ink absorption patterns** and **visible halftone dot structure**. **Paper stock yellowing** appropriate to **1930s-40s comic production**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Hero receives maximum line weight and color saturation**, **typography gets bold treatment**, **background simplified with lighter line weights**. **Material simulation:** **Authentic Golden Age comic production** with **four-color printing limitations** and **newsprint substrate characteristics**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Comic cover composition optimized for **2:3 format** with **typography integration zones** and **newsstand visibility requirements**.
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**IP-Safe Original Superhero Costumes:**

- **Original Hero Design:** **Primary colors excluding Superman's exact scheme** (options: green/gold/white, purple/silver/blue, orange/black/yellow), **unique chest symbol** (geometric shapes, letters, abstract designs), **flowing cape with original color scheme**, **fitted but modest design appropriate to Golden Age sensibilities**, **simple boot and glove design**, **utilitarian belt with period-appropriate buckle**; accessories **0-1** pieces maximum.

**Supporting Character Wardrobe:**

- **Civilians:** **1930s-40s working-class attire** with **simple shirts, trousers, modest dresses**, **functional everyday clothing** appropriate to **Depression-era characters**
- **Authority figures:** **Period police uniforms, simple business suits, municipal worker clothing**
