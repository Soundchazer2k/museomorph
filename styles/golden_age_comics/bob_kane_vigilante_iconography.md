about: >
  Bob Kane’s early vigilante covers mixed crude geometry, moonlit gargoyles, and
  four-color printing quirks. The mood was half pulp thriller, half children’s
  adventure. We retain that angular drama while introducing a wholly original
  shadow guardian.

## Bob Kane Style - Early Batman Iconography (Original Character Framework)

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject as a **generic original dark vigilante hero** in **Bob Kane's early comic book style** for **exact Nano Comics cover format**." **IP Safeguard:** Create original vigilante character with distinct costume design (avoid all bat iconography), unique symbol, different cape style, and alternative color scheme - NO resemblance to Batman/Bruce Wayne. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **dramatic vigilante pose/stern expression/urban crime-fighter stance**; integrate into **early Golden Age comic medium** emphasizing **angular simplicity** and **crude but effective storytelling**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `poster-ink` with **rough halftone patterns** **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` with **vigilante authority** **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Style dominance:** Bob Kane's foundational approach overrides polished art, prioritizing **angular geometry** and **immediate dramatic impact**. **Mode Selector:** Dark Vigilante Comic Cover with Nano Comics branding.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (classic comic book cover - primary choice)
- **3:4** (Golden Age proportion - alternative)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with vigilante prominence and dramatic urban setting
- **Spatial Allocation:** Hero dominance 55-65%, typography zones 15-20%, background 20-25%
- **Background Treatment:** Simple urban night scenes with noir atmosphere and space for cover elements
- **Format Justification:** Comic cover requires vertical emphasis for newsstand appeal with dramatic vigilante positioning
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Bob Kane's pioneering work (1939-1943) established **dark vigilante comic aesthetics** through **angular character design** and **simplified noir atmosphere**. Production method emphasizes **crude but effective linework** with **geometric character construction**, **basic anatomical interpretation**, and **dramatic pose emphasis over realistic detail**. **Paper substrate:** **Rough newsprint with heavy ink absorption** creating **bold contrast effects**. Purpose focuses on **urban crime drama** through **vigilante justice themes** and **noir-influenced atmosphere** within **accessible comic format**. Hallmark motifs include **dramatic cape poses against night skylines**, **angular character silhouettes with geometric construction**, **simple urban environments emphasizing mood**, **bold contrast between light and shadow**, and **crime-fighting scenarios with clear moral authority**. Period framing encompasses **1940s urban noir** with **vigilante justice ideals** creating **dramatic but straightforward storytelling**.

**Innovation line:** **Dark vigilante archetype establishment** / **Urban noir comic integration** / **Dramatic silhouette emphasis** / **Kane's angular geometric style**.
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Angular, geometric weights** at **2.5-3.5 pt** for **character outlines** with **crude but bold construction** and **limited anatomical accuracy**. **Simple shading patterns** with **basic crosshatching** and **bold contrast areas**. **Rough halftone reproduction** at **65-75 LPI** appropriate to **1940s newsprint**. **Color:** **Dark palette dominance** with **high contrast combinations** - **deep blues, blacks, yellows** in **four-color process**. **Limited color sophistication** with **bold primary relationships** and **basic color separation**. **Texture:** **Heavy newsprint grain** with **ink bleeding effects** and **rough paper absorption patterns**. **Basic color registration** with **visible cyan/magenta/yellow/black offset**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Hero receives maximum line emphasis** with **dramatic pose priority**, **background simplified** to **essential noir elements**, **typography integrated** with **period-appropriate boldness**. **Material simulation:** **Early 1940s comic production** with **four-color limitations** and **newsprint substrate characteristics**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Comic cover composition designed for **2:3 format** with **vigilante prominence** and **urban noir atmosphere**.
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**IP-Safe Original Vigilante Design:**
