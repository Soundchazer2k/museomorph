## Will Eisner Style - Urban Noir Comics Framework

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 comic book cover format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject as a **generic original urban vigilante detective** in **Will Eisner's bold noir style** for **exact Vertex Comics cover format**." **IP Safeguard:** Create original urban detective character with completely distinct costume design (NO Spirit mask, NO blue suit, NO red tie, NO Denny Colt references), unique detective theme, and alternative urban setting - ZERO resemblance to The Spirit universe. **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **dramatic detective pose/noir expression/urban investigation stance**; integrate into **gritty urban crime comic medium** emphasizing **bold ink work** and **noir atmosphere**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `brush-wash` with **dramatic contrast** **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` with **detective confidence** **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Style dominance:** Eisner's bold expression overrides clean comic art, prioritizing **dynamic ink work** and **urban noir atmosphere**. **Mode Selector:** Urban Crime Detective Comic with Vertex Comics branding.
