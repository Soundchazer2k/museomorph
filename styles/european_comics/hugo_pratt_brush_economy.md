about: >
  Hugo Pratt lets black ink wander like wind over billowing sails, reducing
  Corto Maltese to a few decisive strokes and a wash of seawater grey. His
  panels balance silence, folklore, and maritime lore without clutter. This
  brief preserves that sparse brush poetry while keeping every insignia, vessel,
  and map safely fictional.

# Hugo Pratt Style - Atmospheric Brush Economy


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 adventure album** or **3:4 contemplative portrait** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL BRUSH ECONOMY DOMINANCE:** Hugo Pratt's bold black brush mastery with **minimal stroke economy** and **contemplative atmospheric simplicity** overrides ALL detailed rendering, busy compositions, and complex textural character presentation. **COMPLETE BRUSH ECONOMY TRANSFORMATION WITH ATMOSPHERIC SIMPLICITY REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Hugo Pratt bold brush economy** with **minimal black brush strokes**, **contemplative character simplicity**, **atmospheric wash effects**, and **historical adventure authenticity** for **exact format specification** - NOT detailed busy rendering, complex textures, or tight realistic presentation." **Anti-Detail Priority:** **NO complex detailed rendering, busy graphic compositions, tight realistic techniques, or excessive texture that eliminates bold brush economy and contemplative atmospheric simplicity.** **Completely redraw emphasizing bold brush economy with minimal atmospheric strokes and contemplative character presentation.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `brush-economy` **Pose Flag:** `contemplative-stillness` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Brush Economy Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must exhibit bold brush economy with atmospheric simplicity integration, not detailed or busy presentation.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Contemplative Adventurer] or [Atmospheric Maritime] per image.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**
