about: >
  Albert Uderzo codified Gallic bravado with bulbous noses, elastic poses, and
  richly researched villages. His line keeps Disney snap but layers in
  archaeological detail and comedic timing. We channel that historic whimsy
  while inventing fresh quests and keeping the potion a safe abstraction.

# Albert Uderzo (Asterix) Style


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks/signatures; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
