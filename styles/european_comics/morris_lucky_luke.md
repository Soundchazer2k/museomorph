about: >
  Morris translated the American West into elastic ligne claire humor—tall hats,
  whiplash lariats, and dust clouds rendered with animation timing. His pages
  juggle slapstick, silhouette clarity, and kid-safe pacing. We keep that breezy
  choreography while inventing new town signs and avoiding licensed cowboy
  clichés.

# Morris (Lucky Luke) Style 


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks/signatures; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 Franco-Belgian comic format** or **4:3 landscape panel** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL CARTOON LIGNE CLAIRE DOMINANCE:** Morris's cartoon simplification overrides ALL photorealistic facial features, realistic human anatomy, and naturalistic proportions. **COMPLETE CARTOON CHARACTER TRANSFORMATION WITH LIGNE CLAIRE SIMPLIFICATION REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Morris cartoon ligne claire character** for **exact format specification** - NOT photorealistic faces, realistic human proportions, or naturalistic rendering." **Anti-Photorealistic Priority:** **NO realistic facial bone structure, human skin textures, or photographic facial accuracy that eliminates cartoon character simplification.** **Completely redraw using Morris's cartoon facial proportions with enlarged noses (2x normal size), simplified dot eyes, and geometric character design.** Identity through **cartoon Western archetype and comedic silhouette ONLY, NOT facial accuracy.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `poster-ink` **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Cartoon Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must look like Morris cartoon character with geometric simplification and ligne claire flat colors, not human with comic filter.** **Complete conversion to cartoon medium with simplified facial geometry.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Western Cartoon Character] or [Comedy Scene] per image.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (Franco-Belgian album format)
- **4:3** (landscape action panel)
- **16:9** (wide Western landscape)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with clean Western environmental expansion
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for maximum comedic impact (clear positioning within open Western landscape)
- **Background Treatment:** Extend simplified Western environments (frontier towns, desert landscapes, simple architectural elements) with ligne claire clarity
- **Format Justification:** Morris's Western tradition requires clean framing supporting character comedy and Western storytelling with ligne claire precision
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Morris's foundational approach (1946-2001) established **Western comedy through ligne claire** with **clean animation-influenced character design** and **efficient visual storytelling**. Production method emphasizes **clear line work** with **Disney animation influence**, **efficient detail economy**, **cinematic page layouts**, and **American Western research integration**. Purpose centers on **comedic Western storytelling** through **affectionate parody** and **accessible visual humor**. Hallmark motifs include **Lucky Luke's iconic cowboy design with flowing duster and wide hat**, **simple but expressive character faces with clear cartoon features**, **clean architectural Western settings**, **flat color schemes supporting character clarity**, **comedic action poses with motion lines**, and **Western genre parody elements with humorous twists**. Period framing encompasses **mythic American Old West** with **Franco-Belgian ligne claire sophistication** creating **accessible Western comedy**. **Tone Tag:** Clean Western humor.
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Ultra-clean ligne claire outlines** with **consistent 1.0-1.5 pt weight** throughout; **NO line weight variation** that suggests realistic depth. **Morris cartoon facial features**: **enlarged geometric noses (2-3x normal proportion)**, **simple dot eyes or basic circles**, **minimal facial detail lines**, **geometric mouth shapes**. **Costume outlines** as **simple geometric shapes** with **no realistic fabric rendering**. **Color:** **Pure flat color fills** at **95-100% saturation** with **zero gradient effects**. **Morris primary palette**: **pure red neckerchiefs (#ff0000)**, **bright yellow shirts (#ffff00)**, **orange desert backgrounds (#ffa500)**, **sky blue (#00bfff)**. **No atmospheric perspective or realistic lighting** - cartoon color logic only. **Texture:** **Absolute zero texture** - **pure flat surfaces only** with **no material simulation whatsoever**. **Morris cartoon characteristics**: **solid color clothing with no wrinkles or folds**, **simple geometric hat shapes**, **flat skin color with no modeling**, **ligne claire perfect smoothness**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Cartoon facial features maximally simplified** - **bulbous noses dominant feature**, **dot eyes**, **simple line mouths**, **no realistic facial anatomy structure**. **Western props** as **basic geometric shapes** with **flat color fills only**.
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**
