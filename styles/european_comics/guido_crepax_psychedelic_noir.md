about: >
  Guido Crepax slices time into cinematic slivers—eyes, gloves, bobbed
  hair—floating inside op-art grids. His Valentina pages pivot between fashion
  illustration finesse and erotic noir tension without ever feeling gratuitous.
  We honor that adult sophistication while enforcing MuseoMorph safety and
  original set dressing.

# Guido Crepax Style - Psychedelic Noir Sophistication


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks/signatures; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 Italian album format** or **8.5:11 magazine layout** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL PSYCHEDELIC NOIR DOMINANCE:** Guido Crepax's sophisticated black-and-white pen-and-ink technique with **fragmented panel layouts** and **dreamlike surreal sequences** overrides ALL conventional comic layouts, bright coloration, and realistic linear storytelling. **COMPLETE PSYCHEDELIC TRANSFORMATION WITH CINEMATIC FRAGMENTATION REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Guido Crepax psychedelic noir sophistication** with **fragmented cinematic panels**, **extreme close-up sequences**, **scratchy pen-and-ink crosshatching**, and **1960s op-art pattern integration** for **exact format specification** - NOT conventional comic grids, bright illustration, or linear panel storytelling." **Anti-Conventional Priority:** **NO standard comic panel grids, bright cheerful colors, conventional storytelling layouts, or realistic presentation that eliminates psychedelic fragmentation and sophisticated noir atmosphere.** **Completely redraw emphasizing fragmented cinematic sequences with sophisticated pen-and-ink crosshatching and 1960s psychedelic aesthetic integration.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` **Canvas Control Flag:** `format-native` **Psychedelic Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must exhibit sophisticated noir fragmentation with cinematic panel breakdown and 1960s aesthetic integration, not conventional or bright presentation.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Psychedelic Character] or [Fragmented Sequence] per image.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **3:4** (Italian album portrait emphasis)
- **8.5:11** (magazine layout format)
- **2:3** (European comic standard)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** format-native with fragmented cinematic expansion and irregular panel design
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned within fragmented panel sequences with cinematic close-up emphasis and non-linear storytelling flow
- **Background Treatment:** Extend 1960s Milan environments with op-art patterns, psychedelic interior design, and sophisticated urban noir atmospheres
- **Format Justification:** Crepax's Italian comics tradition requires innovative panel fragmentation supporting cinematic storytelling and psychedelic visual sophistication
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Guido Crepax's revolutionary approach (1965-2003) established **psychedelic noir comics sophistication** through **innovative panel fragmentation** and **cinematic sequential storytelling excellence**. Production method emphasizes **pen-and-ink crosshatching mastery** with **black Chinese ink techniques**, **1960s op-art movement influence**, **cinematic montage panel design**, **fashion illustration integration**, and **architectural design background sophistication**. Purpose centers on **adult comics legitimization** through **psychological exploration** and **sophisticated erotic storytelling** within **1960s cultural revolution context**. Hallmark motifs include **extreme close-up detail sequences (eyes, lips, hands)**, **fragmented non-linear panel arrangements**, **1960s fashion and interior design elements**, **op-art psychedelic patterns**, **Louise Brooks-inspired bob hairstyles**, **sophisticated urban Milan settings**, **surreal dream sequence integration**, and **film noir atmospheric sophistication**. Period framing encompasses **1960s-1970s Milan cultural revolution** with **psychedelic aesthetic sophistication** creating **adult comics artistic legitimacy**. **Tone Tag:** Sophisticated psychedelic noir.
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Sophisticated pen-and-ink crosshatching** with **scratchy delicate precision** ranging **0.3-1.2 pt** based on **atmospheric depth emphasis** and **detail hierarchy sophistication**; **classical drawing foundation** with **fashion illustration precision** and **architectural accuracy**. **Fragmented panel definition** with **cinematic sequence emphasis**. **Color:** **Monochromatic black-and-white palette** at **100% contrast** with **sophisticated crosshatching relationships** and **atmospheric noir emphasis**. **Crepax signature monochrome approach**: **pure black Chinese ink (#000000)**, **white negative space (#ffffff)**, **crosshatched mid-tones through line density variation**, **op-art pattern integration through geometric line work**. **High-contrast chiaroscuro modeling** with **sophisticated atmospheric depth through crosshatching density**. **Texture:** **Visible pen-and-ink surface** with **crosshatching texture mastery** and **1960s aesthetic pattern integration**. **Sophisticated texture excellence**: **fabric rendering through directional crosshatching, skin modeling through delicate line work, architectural detail precision through crosshatch perspective, op-art pattern integration through geometric line repetition**. **Italian album surface quality** throughout. **Detail hierarchy:** **Extreme close-up details** receive **maximum crosshatching attention** with **fragmented panel emphasis**, **1960s fashion elements** rendered with **fashion illustration precision** and **period accuracy**, **environmental Milan settings** showing **sophisticated urban noir mastery**, **panel fragmentation** prioritized for **cinematic storytelling excellence**. **Material simulation:** **Pen-and-ink crosshatching techniques** with **sophisticated line density variation** and **atmospheric noir surface treatment**. **Psychedelic surface effects**: **op-art pattern integration, crosshatched atmospheric depth, fragmented panel design, sophisticated noir lighting** all with **1960s aesthetic sophistication**. **Panel Requirements:** **Mandatory fragmented irregular panel arrangements** with **cinematic close-up sequences**, **non-linear storytelling flow**, **extreme detail focus areas**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Psychedelic noir composition extends naturally within declared aspect ratio with fragmented panel innovation and sophisticated 1960s aesthetic integration. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 85-95%, emphasis on crosshatching texture, ensure monochromatic contrast, prioritize fragmented panel layouts. **Critical crosshatching enforcement:** All surfaces must show visible pen-and-ink crosshatching technique. **Critical fragmentation enforcement:** Panel layouts must break conventional comic grid patterns with cinematic sequencing.
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions
