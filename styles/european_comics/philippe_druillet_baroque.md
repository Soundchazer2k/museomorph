about: >
  Philippe Druillet weaponizes ligne claire precision into maximalist cathedrals
  of sci-fi dread, drowning every panel in ornamental ink and saturated gouache.
  Lone Sloane and his cosmic adversaries stride through symmetrical mandalas,
  Lovecraftian engines, and blazing colour vaults. MuseoMorph preserves that
  metal-hurlant monumentality while keeping the iconography original and free of
  signatures or publisher marks.
