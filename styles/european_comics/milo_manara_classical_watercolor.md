about: >
  Milo Manara paints Renaissance grace with inky confidence—transparent washes,
  sinuous poses, and architectural backdrops that glow. His figures feel sensual
  yet studied, grounded in classical proportion rather than shock value. We echo
  that elegance while ensuring attire, context, and gestures remain comfortably
  within MuseoMorph safety bands.

# Milo Manara Style


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks/signature; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 European illustration format** or **3:4 classical portrait** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL CLASSICAL ILLUSTRATION DOMINANCE:** Milo Manara's traditional watercolor and ink technique overrides ALL digital painting, photorealistic rendering, and modern illustration approaches. **COMPLETE TRADITIONAL ILLUSTRATION TRANSFORMATION WITH RENAISSANCE INFLUENCE REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Milo Manara classical watercolor illustration** for **exact format specification** - NOT digital painting, photorealistic rendering, or modern illustration techniques." **Anti-Digital Priority:** **NO digital painting smoothness, photorealistic skin textures, or modern rendering that eliminates traditional watercolor transparency and classical ink line work.** **Completely redraw using Manara's traditional illustration techniques with watercolor transparency, classical figure proportions, and Renaissance-influenced composition.** Identity through **classical artistic archetype and elegant gesture ONLY, NOT photographic accuracy.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `diffusion-soft` **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Traditional Illustration Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must look like classical watercolor illustration with Renaissance proportions and traditional technique transparency, not digital art or photograph.** **Complete conversion to traditional illustration medium with classical artistic sophistication.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Classical Figure Study] or [Renaissance Scene] per image.
