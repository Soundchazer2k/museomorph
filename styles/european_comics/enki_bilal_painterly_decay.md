about: >
  Enki Bilal smears watercolor, gouache, and pencil into cold dystopian
  portraits where blue skin, ash, and rust grind together. His Franco-Belgian
  spreads hang on weathered faces, propaganda residue, and brutalist backdrops
  that feel lifted from a crumbling future. This brief keeps the mixed-media
  patina and political melancholy without inheriting specific characters or
  state iconography.

# Enki Bilal — Dystopian Painterly Realism

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks/signatures; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 dystopian album format** or **3:4 political portrait** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL PAINTERLY DECAY DOMINANCE:** Enki Bilal's visible brushwork mixed-media realism with **weathered facial precision** and **atmospheric social breakdown** overrides ALL clean digital art, bright optimistic imagery, and non-textural character presentation. **COMPLETE PAINTERLY ATMOSPHERIC TRANSFORMATION WITH VISIBLE DECAY TEXTURE REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Enki Bilal painterly decay realism** with **visible mixed-media brushwork**, **weathered contemplative faces**, **atmospheric social breakdown**, and **cold muted color dominance with strategic warm accents** for **exact format specification** - NOT clean digital art, bright imagery, or smooth character design." **Anti-Digital Priority:** **NO clean surfaces, bright optimistic colors, smooth rendering, or apolitical presentation that eliminates visible brushwork decay and atmospheric social tension.** **Completely redraw emphasizing visible painterly texture with weathered character faces and environmental breakdown.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `brush-wash` **Pose Flag:** `contemplative-stillness` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Painterly Decay Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must exhibit visible brushwork texture with weathered atmospheric integration, not clean or optimistic presentation.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Weathered Character] or [Decay Environment] per image.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (dystopian album standard)
- **3:4** (political character portrait)
- **16:9** (social decay panorama)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with painterly atmospheric expansion and visible texture integration
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned within decaying social environments emphasizing weathered contemplation and atmospheric breakdown
- **Background Treatment:** Extend crumbling urban dystopias with visible brushwork, political architectural decay with mixed-media texture, atmospheric social environments with painterly depth integration
- **Format Justification:** Bilal's European painterly tradition requires atmospheric decay framing supporting weathered character presentation and visible brushwork sophistication through mixed-media atmospheric integration

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Enki Bilal's distinctive approach (1975-present) established **painterly dystopian realism** through **visible mixed-media brushwork** and **weathered character sophistication**. Production method emphasizes **mixed-media painting mastery** with **watercolor, gouache, and pencil integration**, **Yugoslav war trauma atmospheric influence**, **architectural decay research with painterly interpretation**, **blue-skinned figure surreal integration**, and **contemplative weathered character excellence**. Purpose centers on **atmospheric political exploration** through **painterly social decay** and **contemplative character integration**. Hallmark motifs include **weathered contemplative faces with painterly precision**, **visible mixed-media brushwork creating atmospheric texture**, **crumbling dystopian cityscapes with painterly architectural decay**, **cold muted color palettes with strategic warm accents**, **atmospheric environmental breakdown with visible texture**, **political media integration with painterly sophistication**, and **contemplative character poses suggesting social alienation**. Period framing encompasses **near-future dystopian political settings** with **painterly atmospheric sophistication** creating **weathered social realism**. **Tone Tag:** Painterly contemplative decay.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Visible mixed-media line work** with **painterly texture emphasis** ranging **0.3-2.5 pt** based on **atmospheric hierarchy** and **weathered character integration**; **contemplative edge definition** with **brushwork texture modeling**. **Weathered architectural precision** with **painterly decay integration**. **Color:** **Cold muted palette** at **45-70% saturation** with **atmospheric painterly relationships** and **strategic warm accent emphasis**. **Bilal signature painterly approach**: **cold atmospheric blues (#4a5568, #718096)**, **muted decay grays (#9ca3af, #6b7280)**, **strategic warm flesh tones (#d69e2e, #b7791f)**, **environmental breakdown browns (#92400e, #a16207)**. **Cold dominant color temperature** with **strategic warm character accents** and **atmospheric painterly integration**. **Texture:** **Visible mixed-media surface** with **painterly decay mastery** and **atmospheric brushwork effects**. **Painterly atmospheric texture mastery**: **weathered character skin with visible brushwork modeling, environmental decay surfaces with mixed-media precision, clothing fabric with painterly wear patterns, atmospheric breakdown with visible texture integration**. **European painterly surface quality** throughout. **Detail hierarchy:** **Weathered contemplative characters** receive **maximum painterly attention** with **atmospheric integration emphasis**, **dystopian environmental elements** rendered with **visible brushwork precision** and **decay atmospheric detail**, **architectural breakdown elements** showing **painterly decay mastery**, **atmospheric integration** prioritized for **contemplative weathered inspiration**. **Material simulation:** **Mixed-media painting techniques** with **visible brushwork mastery** and **atmospheric decay treatment**. **Painterly atmospheric effects:** **visible brushwork modeling, weathered texture integration, atmospheric breakdown precision, contemplative character depth** all with **painterly sophistication**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Painterly atmospheric composition extends naturally within declared aspect ratio with weathered character emphasis and visible brushwork presentation. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 75-85%, chaos to 25-35%, CFG scale 10-14 for **painterly atmospheric realism** with **visible brushwork integration**. **Critical brushwork enforcement:** All surfaces must show visible mixed-media brushwork with painterly texture. **Critical weathering enforcement:** Characters must display contemplative weathered faces with atmospheric integration. **Critical decay enforcement:** Environmental elements must show **architectural breakdown** with **visible texture integration**.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **Weathered utilitarian attire** with **layered industrial fabrics**, **function-first silhouettes**, and **muted chroma**; ornament scale **0-1** (political armbands, worn scarves); hair & makeup **0-1** (cropped, disheveled).
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Heavy coats, military surplus, propaganda field gear** with **visible weathering**; accessories **1-2** (gas mask, respirator gear, political insignia remixed); facial hair unkempt **0-1**.
- **Youth:** **Civilian survival clothing**, patched coats, utilitarian boots; accessories restricted to **1** (propaganda flyer, ration container).

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [weathered propaganda poster, industrial respirator, decaying transit ticket, flickering neon sign, analog surveillance camera]
  occasional: [rusted mech fragment, political mural remnant, cracked glass visor]
  rare: [floating archival media core, dystopian throne apparatus]
  exclusions:
    - "no pristine technology"
    - "no cheerful consumer products"
  dependencies:
    - "political symbols must be fictional or abstracted"
    - "weapons require anti-militarist framing (holstered, discarded, or symbolic)"
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**Canvas Negatives:** "clean digital surfaces", "bright optimistic palette", "anime-slick character rendering", "propaganda reproductions", "real-world political leaders"; **NO recognizable state iconography**; **NO graphic gore**; **NO real corporate logos**. **Canvas Positives:** "visible mixed-media brushwork", "weathered dystopian palette", "fictional propaganda motifs", "architectural decay"; enforce **original political symbolism** and **fictional text treatments**; keep attire **modest and period-agnostic**.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 2:3 Dystopian Album:** Centered contemplative figure against crumbling institutional backdrop with asymmetrical negative space
- **For 3:4 Political Portrait:** Bust or three-quarter portrait with weathered environmental framing and propaganda residue
- **For 16:9 Social Panorama:** Wide urban decay establishers with small figures dwarfed by architecture and atmospheric lighting

**Staging:** Subjects positioned within **atmospheric weathered scenarios** showing **contemplative resistance** and **painterly atmospheric capability** in **crumbling atmospheric environments with visible brushwork decay elements**. **Camera/perspective:** **Contemplative atmospheric angles** supporting **weathered character drama** and **painterly atmospheric excellence**. **Background density:** **Atmospheric weathered environments** with **visible brushwork effects**, **crumbling painterly architectural elements**, **atmospheric decay integration**, and **contemplative environmental quality with painterly precision**. **Environmental Requirements:** **Mandatory atmospheric urban landscapes with painterly decay precision**, **visible brushwork architectural elements or atmospheric breakdown features**, **contemplative atmospheric integration or weathered symbols**, **cold atmospheric perspective with painterly texture**, **visible brushwork creating contemplative atmospheric contemplation**. **Surface Context Anchor:** Painterly atmospheric surface with visible brushwork appropriate to weathered contemplative storytelling **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Atmospheric painterly environments extend naturally within declared ratio while maintaining contemplative weathered character focus and visible brushwork excellence.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** allow - **Essential** for political atmospheric tradition; **allow embedded text** for **contemplative atmospheric storytelling**.

**Ratio-Appropriate Zones:** Atmospheric composition optimized for declared aspect ratio with **painterly atmospheric text integration**

**Copy limits:** ≤3 words/line for **atmospheric titles**, ≤4 coverlines positioned within **painterly composition**

**Font recommendation:** **Closest Google Font: Source Sans Pro (contemporary atmospheric analog, 75%). Better: Contemporary atmospheric fonts appropriate to painterly contemplative excellence.**

**Format-Specific Text Rules:**

- **Atmospheric album mode:** mandatory painterly text integration, contemplative hierarchy, atmospheric typography
- **Portrait mode:** optional contemplative character text elements
- **Atmospheric panorama mode:** painterly atmospheric text integration supporting contemplative decay mood

**Historical accuracy:** fonts must support atmospheric contemplative atmosphere without breaking painterly weathered authenticity.
