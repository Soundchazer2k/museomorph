  Juanjo Guarnido renders the Blacksad menagerie with Disney-calibrated anatomy,
  watercolor smoke, and 1950s grit. Every whisker, fedora, and neon reflection
  sells the noir mood without slipping into caricature. We keep that cinematic
  realism while ensuring new cases, new signage, and zero borrowed trademarks.

# Juanjo Guarnido Style - Anthropomorphic Noir Realism


> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks/signatures; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **8.5:11 European album** or **16:9 cinematic panorama** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL ANTHROPOMORPHIC NOIR DOMINANCE:** Juanjo Guarnido's hyperrealistic anthropomorphic characters with **detailed watercolor backgrounds** and **film noir atmospheric lighting** overrides ALL cartoon animal styles, flat backgrounds, and non-cinematic character presentation. **COMPLETE ANTHROPOMORPHIC TRANSFORMATION WITH DETAILED ENVIRONMENTAL REALISM REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Juanjo Guarnido anthropomorphic noir realism** with **detailed animal head on human body proportions**, **hyperrealistic watercolor backgrounds**, **film noir lighting and shadows**, and **1950s period accuracy** for **exact format specification** - NOT cartoon animals, flat backgrounds, or non-noir character design." **Anti-Cartoon Priority:** **NO cartoon animal styles, simplified backgrounds, bright non-noir colors, or amateur anthropomorphic design that eliminates hyperrealistic detail and atmospheric sophistication.** **Completely redraw emphasizing hyperrealistic anthropomorphic characters with detailed environmental backgrounds and film noir atmospheric mastery.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `watercolor-soft` **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Anthropomorphic Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must exhibit hyperrealistic anthropomorphic design with detailed atmospheric backgrounds, not cartoon or simplified presentation.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Noir Character] or [Atmospheric Scene] per image.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **8.5:11** (European album standard)
- **16:9** (cinematic panoramic scene)
- **3:4** (detailed character portrait)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with atmospheric noir expansion and detailed environmental design
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for maximum character expression with atmospheric environmental context and cinematic composition
- **Background Treatment:** Extend detailed 1950s American environments with hyperrealistic architectural accuracy, period vehicle design, and atmospheric lighting effects
- **Format Justification:** Guarnido's European album tradition requires detailed framing supporting anthropomorphic character focus and atmospheric environmental storytelling
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **1950s period styling** with **film noir sophistication** and **detailed accuracy**, **period-accurate clothing** with **atmospheric design** and **hyperrealistic fabric rendering**, **noir character attire** showing **1950s fashion authenticity** and **atmospheric integration**, ornament scale **1-2** (period jewelry with 1950s accuracy, noir accessories, atmospheric elements); hair & makeup scale **1-2** (1950s styling with **period authenticity**); **period-accurate footwear** with **1950s fashion precision**.
