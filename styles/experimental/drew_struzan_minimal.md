  Drew Struzan defined the visual marketing of Hollywood's blockbuster era.
  His hand-painted posters for Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Back to the Future
  blend photorealistic precision with painterly idealism, creating iconic images
  that feel both larger-than-life and warmly nostalgic.

## Style Essence
Heroic, idealized portraiture for cinema. Subjects are rendered with a warm,
hand-crafted quality that digital art cannot replicate. The signature is the
marriage of airbrush softness (glowing backgrounds, ethereal light) with
colored pencil sharpness (precise facial details, textured surfaces). The
result is instantly recognizable: epic, emotional, and unmistakably painted.

## Technique
- **Foundation:** Airbrush underpainting in warm sepia/ochre tones establishes
  values, mood, and soft atmospheric glows before any detail work begins
- **Development:** Colored pencils (Prismacolor) layered meticulously over
  airbrushed base—sharp strokes for hair, skin texture, fabric weave
- **Finish:** White gouache highlights for rim lighting and reflective surfaces;
  final result balances photorealistic faces with painterly energy
- **Signature elements:** Anamorphic lens flares, radiating light sources,
  cinematic rim lighting on heroic figures

## Composition
- **Structure:** Central heroic pyramid—protagonist dominates foreground,
  supporting characters radiate outward in montage arrangement
- **Depth:** Large detailed foreground figures, action-filled midground,
  atmospheric cosmic/landscape background fading to soft focus
- **Lighting:** Dramatic backlighting and rim light; key light often warm,
  fill light cool; strong warm-cool contrast throughout
- **Color:** High saturation cinematic palette—warm golds/oranges against
  cool blues/purples; never muddy, always vibrant

## Likeness Handling
- **Preserve:** Facial structure, distinctive features, expression, and gesture.
  The subject must be recognizable as themselves.
- **Transform:** Render with painterly idealism—slightly heroic proportions,
  luminous skin, enhanced drama. Not a photograph, but a heroic portrait.
- **Anachronisms:** Modern clothing acceptable if character-appropriate (this is
  contemporary cinema). Avoid visible modern tech in hands (phones, earbuds).

## Constraints
- No digital coldness or over-smoothed surfaces—maintain visible brush/pencil texture
- No flat photographic composites—everything must feel unified and hand-painted
- No cluttered layouts—clear visual hierarchy with breathing room
- No harsh, unblended edges—even sharp details emerge from soft foundations
- No desaturated or muted palettes—Struzan's work is vibrant and warm
