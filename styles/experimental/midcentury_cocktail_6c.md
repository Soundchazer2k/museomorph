about: >
  Flat graphic illustration inspired by mid-century modern aesthetics,
  tiki culture, and the perpetual cocktail party. Characterized by
  elongated stylized figures, crisp black outlines, solid unblended
  color fields, and UPA animation influence. Evokes 1950s-60s
  sophisticated leisure and retro-futurism.

## Style Direction

[Subject]: Stylish, elongated figure in elegant mid-century modern attire; simplified stylized face with minimal features; sophisticated and slightly theatrical presence; proportions stretched for graphic elegance

[Action]: Holding a cocktail, posed casually with slightly theatrical elegance; relaxed sophistication suggesting perpetual cocktail party; subtle gesture of leisure and refinement

[Environment]: Retro mid-century modern interior with iconic furniture (Eames chairs, kidney-shaped coffee tables, boomerang patterns); tropical plants and tiki elements; geometric wallpaper patterns; floor-to-ceiling windows; indoor/outdoor California lifestyle

[Art Style]: Flat graphic illustration with crisp black outlines, cel-animation aesthetic, no visible brushstrokes; solid unblended color fields like vintage screen printing; UPA animation influence (sophisticated, minimal, graphically bold); acrylic on board appearance

[Lighting]: Flat, even illumination with no shadows or gradients - pure graphic clarity; no light source simulation; colors maintain full saturation without atmospheric effects

[Details]: Vibrant 1950s-60s palette (avocado green, burnt orange, turquoise, coral pink); stylized faces with minimal features (simple dots for eyes, geometric nose); geometric patterns on fabrics and wallpaper; crisp consistent-weight black outlines fully enclosing each shape

## Technical Notes

Render as flat acrylic on board with no visible texture.
All colors should be solid, unblended fields - like vintage screen printing.
Black outlines must be crisp, consistent weight, and fully enclosing each shape.
Figures should have elongated proportions and simplified, stylized faces.
Maintain UPA animation aesthetic - sophisticated, minimal, graphically bold.
Include period-appropriate props: cocktail glasses, cigarette holders, hi-fi equipment.
Furniture should reference iconic mid-century designs (Eames, Nelson, Noguchi).

## Constraints

- AVOID gradients, shadows, or atmospheric perspective - must be completely flat
- AVOID photorealistic rendering - embrace graphic stylization throughout
- AVOID modern or neon colors - use harmonious mid-century palette only
- AVOID realistic facial features - faces are minimal and geometric
- AVOID visible brushwork or texture - surface is smooth and graphic
- AVOID breaking the perpetual cocktail party atmosphere - mood is sophisticated leisure
- AVOID inconsistent line weights - black outlines must be uniform throughout
