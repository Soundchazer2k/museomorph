## Style Essence
One paragraph describing the artist's signature aesthetic, emotional tone,
and what makes their work instantly recognizable.

## Technique
- **Foundation:** How the work begins (underpainting, sketch, base layer)
- **Development:** Primary technique and tools used
- **Finish:** What gives the final work its character
- **Signature elements:** Unique technical hallmarks

## Composition
- **Structure:** How subjects are arranged (pyramid, asymmetric, central, etc.)
- **Depth:** Foreground/midground/background treatment
- **Lighting:** Characteristic light direction and quality
- **Color:** Palette tendencies and contrasts

## Likeness Handling
How to adapt a reference photo while maintaining style authenticity:
- What to preserve (structure, expression, gesture)
- What to transform (rendering style, idealization level)
- Anachronism rules (modern elements to avoid or adapt)

## Constraints
Hard rules that define what this style is NOT:
- Techniques or aesthetics to avoid
- Modern elements that break authenticity
- Common AI mistakes to prevent
