about: >
  Saul Bass revolutionized film title design, transforming static credits into
  dynamic visual overtures. His minimalist aesthetic—bold geometric shapes,
  limited color palettes, and kinetic typography—created iconic imagery for
  Hitchcock, Preminger, and Scorsese. His philosophy: distill complexity into
  a single, powerful symbol.

## Style Essence
Graphic minimalism with psychological weight. Bass reduces subjects to their
essential silhouette or symbolic form—a torn paper arm, a spiraling vortex,
fragmented typography. The style is stark, high-contrast, and deliberately
anti-photographic. Every element serves the concept; nothing is decorative.
The result feels like a visual thesis statement rather than a portrait.

## Technique
- **Foundation:** Flat color fields in stark contrast (often black/white
  with one bold accent color like red or orange)
- **Development:** Cut-paper aesthetic with hard scissor-cut edges; no soft
  gradients, no airbrush blending, no painterly texture
- **Finish:** Graphic crispness—clean vector-like forms that read instantly
  from any distance; matte, flat color without texture
- **Signature elements:** Geometric fragmentation, kinetic implied motion,
  symbolic abstraction (silhouettes, isolated body parts, spiral motifs)

## Composition
- **Structure:** Asymmetrical geometric armatures with aggressive negative space;
  elements often break or interact with frame edges
- **Depth:** Deliberately flat—no atmospheric perspective, no foreground/background
  separation; all elements exist on the same graphic plane
- **Lighting:** Flat, sourceless illumination; no cast shadows, no volumetric
  lighting; forms are defined by shape, not light
- **Color:** Strictly limited palette—typically 2-3 colors maximum; high saturation,
  high contrast; monochromatic fields with single accent

## Likeness Handling
- **Preserve:** Only the essential silhouette and gesture—the recognizable outline
  that identifies the subject at a glance
- **Transform:** Reduce the subject to flat geometric forms; no facial detail,
  no skin texture, no photographic rendering; the subject becomes a symbol
- **Anachronisms:** Irrelevant—Bass's style is timeless graphic design, not
  period-specific illustration; modern subjects work perfectly

## Constraints
- No photorealistic rendering—faces are silhouettes or flat shapes only
- No soft edges, gradients, or painterly blending—all edges are hard-cut
- No decorative elements—every shape must serve the concept
- No complex color palettes—three colors maximum
- No atmospheric depth—maintain flat graphic plane
- No texture—surfaces are clean, matte, and uniform
