about: >
  Drew Struzan defined Hollywood's blockbuster era through hand-painted posters
  for Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Back to the Future. His signature technique
  marries airbrush ethereal softness with colored pencil precision, creating
  heroic portraits that feel both cinematic and warmly nostalgic.

## Style Essence

Heroic, idealized portraiture for cinema. Struzan's work is instantly recognizable
by the marriage of airbrush softness (glowing backgrounds, ethereal light halos)
with colored pencil sharpness (precise facial details, textured surfaces). The
result feels epic, emotional, and unmistakably hand-painted—never cold or digital.

## Technique Markers

- Airbrush underpainting in warm sepia and ochre tones establishing mood
- Prismacolor colored pencils layered for faces, hair, fabric texture
- White gouache highlights for rim lighting and reflective surfaces
- Anamorphic lens flares and radiating light sources
- Visible pencil stroke texture on focal areas

## Composition Patterns

- Central heroic pyramid with protagonist at apex
- Montage of supporting characters radiating outward
- Layered depth: sharp foreground figures, action midground, soft atmospheric background
- Dramatic backlighting with warm key, cool fill
- High saturation palette: warm golds/oranges against cool blues/purples

## Likeness Guidance

- Preserve facial structure, distinctive features, and expression
- Render with painterly idealism: luminous skin, slightly heroic proportions
- Transform toward cinematic grandeur while maintaining recognition
- The subject becomes a movie star version of themselves
