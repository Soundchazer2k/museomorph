about: >

  with dynamic montage backgrounds. Combines airbrush underpainting with
  colored pencil detail work for photorealistic faces and painterly energy.
  Iconic technique used for Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and countless 80s films.

## Style Direction

[Subject]: Heroic portrait of the provided person as a movie protagonist; photorealistic facial features with subtle painterly idealization; confident, powerful presence

[Action]: Standing confidently, gazing heroically toward camera or horizon; dynamic pose suggesting readiness for adventure; strong silhouette and commanding posture

[Environment]: Cinematic montage background with action vignettes radiating outward from central figure; secondary characters, vehicles, or dramatic scenes arranged in compositional hierarchy; atmospheric clouds and dramatic skies

[Art Style]: Hand-painted movie poster on illustration board; airbrush underpainting creating soft gradients and atmospheric glow; colored pencil detail layer for sharp edges on face, hair, and clothing; visible traditional media texture throughout

[Lighting]: Dramatic rim lighting from behind (6500K cool daylight) separating figure from background; warm key light from upper-left (3200K tungsten); cool fill shadows; golden hour glow suffusing the composition; high contrast (5:1) for cinematic drama

[Details]: Photorealistic face with painterly idealization; visible colored pencil strokes in hair and fabric; soft airbrush gradients in sky and atmospheric effects; warm-cool color temperature contrast; saturated palette (70-85%); clear visual hierarchy with central figure dominating

## Technical Notes

Render as traditional illustration on board, not digital art.
Use airbrush-style soft gradients for backgrounds and atmospheric glow.
Apply colored pencil texture for sharp details on face, hair, and clothing.
Maintain clear visual hierarchy with central heroic figure dominating composition.
Background montage elements should be slightly less detailed than central figure.
Warm colors (golds, oranges) should dominate with cool accents (blues, purples) for contrast.

## Constraints

- AVOID flat, even lighting - must have dramatic rim light and warm/cool contrast
- AVOID digital smoothness - surface should show traditional media texture (pencil, airbrush)
- AVOID desaturated colors - palette should be vivid and cinematic
- AVOID placing figure too small - protagonist should dominate 60-70% of frame height
- AVOID modern photographic look - must feel hand-painted, not photographed
- AVOID losing likeness - facial structure and expression must be preserved while idealized
