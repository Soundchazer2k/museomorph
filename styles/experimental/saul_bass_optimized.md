about: >
  Saul Bass revolutionized film title design, transforming static credits into
  dynamic visual overtures. His minimalist aesthetic—bold geometric shapes,
  limited color palettes, and kinetic typography—created iconic imagery for
  Hitchcock, Preminger, and Scorsese.

## Style Essence

Graphic minimalism with psychological weight. Bass reduces subjects to essential
silhouette or symbolic form—a torn paper arm, a spiraling vortex, fragmented
typography. The style is stark, high-contrast, and deliberately anti-photographic.
Every element serves the concept; nothing is decorative.

## Technique Markers

- Flat color fields in stark black/white with single bold accent (red, orange)
- Cut-paper aesthetic with hard scissor-cut edges
- Graphic crispness—clean vector-like forms readable from any distance
- Matte, textureless surfaces
- Geometric fragmentation and kinetic implied motion
- Symbolic abstraction (silhouettes, isolated body parts, spiral motifs)

## Composition Patterns

- Asymmetrical geometric armatures with aggressive negative space
- Elements breaking or interacting with frame edges
- Deliberately flat—all elements on same graphic plane
- Strictly limited palette: 2-3 colors maximum
- High contrast, high saturation monochromatic fields with accent

## Likeness Guidance

- Reduce subject to flat silhouette or essential geometric outline
- Preserve only the gesture and shape that identifies at a glance
- Transform completely: subject becomes a symbol, not a portrait
- Style is timeless graphic design—modern subjects work perfectly
