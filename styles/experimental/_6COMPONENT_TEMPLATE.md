## Style Direction

[Subject]: Description of how subjects/figures should be portrayed (idealization level, proportions, expression style, anatomical treatment)

[Action]: Characteristic poses, gestures, and figure treatments (heroic, contemplative, dynamic, candid)

[Environment]: Background treatments and settings (atmospheric, montage, environmental, minimal); depth planes and integration approach

[Art Style]: Core technique description without artist name (medium, underpainting, layering approach, surface finish, texture)

[Lighting]: Signature lighting setup with color temperatures in Kelvin (key light direction, quality, contrast ratio, rim/accent lights, shadow treatment)

[Details]: Distinguishing textures, finishes, and signature elements (edge treatment, brush strokes, color relationships, focal area rendering)

## Technical Notes

Render guidance that supports the style authenticity:
- Medium specification (oil, acrylic, digital, etc.)
- Surface/ground treatment
- Layer building approach
- Texture and finish requirements
- Color mixing and application notes

## Constraints

AVOID directives - what AI models commonly get wrong:
- AVOID [common error #1] - [reason]
- AVOID [common error #2] - [reason]
- AVOID [common error #3] - [reason]
- AVOID [common error #4] - [reason]
- AVOID [common error #5] - [reason]
