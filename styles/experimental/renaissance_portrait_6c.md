about: >
  High Renaissance portrait technique featuring sfumato (smoke-like) transitions
  between tones and colors. Multiple thin transparent oil glazes over tinted
  gesso create inner luminosity. Atmospheric landscapes with aerial perspective
  recede into mysterious blue distances. Psychological depth through subtle
  expression and contemplative poses.

## Style Direction

[Subject]: Portrait rendered with classical idealization yet profound psychological depth; anatomically precise with subtle, enigmatic expression; three-quarter view with gentle contrapposto; luminous flesh tones against muted earth palette

[Action]: Contemplative, poised stillness; hands positioned with deliberate grace; subtle gesture suggesting inner thought; direct or slightly averted gaze inviting viewer engagement

[Environment]: Mysterious atmospheric landscape with winding rivers, craggy mountains, and hazy blue distances; seamlessly integrated through aerial perspective; 3-4 distinct depth planes receding into sfumato mist; fantastical geological formations

[Art Style]: Oil on panel with multiple thin transparent glazes over tinted gesso ground; smooth enamel-like surface with no visible brushstrokes; warm ochre underpainting visible through translucent upper layers; inner luminosity from layered glazes

[Lighting]: Soft diffused light from upper-left at ~45°, approximately 5000-5500K neutral daylight; moderate contrast (3:1) with velvety shadows containing reflected light; subtle rim lighting on facial contours; no harsh directional shadows

[Details]: Imperceptible edge transitions (sfumato); lost-and-found contours especially around eyes, nose, and lips; rich shadow depth without harshness; luminous flesh tones (#C1A28A) against deep verdant greens (#4E6B4B) and atmospheric blues; surface texture suggesting aged oil panel

## Technical Notes

Render as traditional oil painting on prepared wood panel, not digital art.
Build form through subtle tonal gradation, never hard edges or sharp outlines.
Shadows must retain translucency and warmth - avoid flat black or cool grey.
Highlights are soft off-white (#E6E6E6), never pure stark white.
Background should dissolve into blue-grey atmospheric haze with distance.
Period-appropriate costume (Renaissance dress, modest, layered fabrics).
Craquelure texture optional but authentic for aged panel appearance.

## Constraints

- AVOID sharp, crisp edges - all contours must blend imperceptibly (sfumato)
- AVOID high saturation - palette is muted and tonal, not vivid
- AVOID pure black shadows - shadows are rich, warm, and translucent
- AVOID modern digital smoothness - surface should feel painted with inner luminosity from layered glazes
- AVOID flat backgrounds - environment must recede through aerial perspective with 3-4 depth planes
- AVOID stark contrast - transitions between light and shadow must be gradual and seamless
- AVOID pure white highlights - highlights are soft off-white, never stark
