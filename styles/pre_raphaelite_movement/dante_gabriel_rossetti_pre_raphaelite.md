# Dante Gabriel Rossetti - Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood Framework

**Timeframe:** 1848-1882
 **Historical Context:** The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was a revolutionary movement founded in London in 1848 by seven young artists who sought to overthrow academic conventions descended from Raphael. They championed "truth to nature" through microscopic observation, embraced literary and medieval themes with psychological realism, and pioneered the white ground painting technique that created unprecedented jewel-like color luminosity. Dante Gabriel Rossetti was a founding member and key figure, known for his distinctive female archetype—languid, psychologically intense figures with voluminous red-blonde hair—and his integration of visual art with poetry (sonnets accompanying paintings). The Brotherhood received formal training at Royal Academy Schools but consciously rebelled against academic formulas, painting outdoors (en plein air), using innovative 19th-century pigments, and committing to "painful" application of microscopic detail throughout every element of their compositions.

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement Protocol:** Aspect ratio control is prompt-based only. Combat model's resistance through explicit ratio declaration in multiple locations, repetitive reinforcement, negative constraints, and compositional anchors designed for target ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via Rossettian archetype (enigmatic interiority, psychological intensity, idiosyncratic features).
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("110-120% lip fullness", "Chinese White priming", "microscopic detail commitment") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** White ground technique and microscopic observation supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `white-ground-luminosity` (revolutionary priming technique)
- **Pose Flags:** `psychological-tension`, `languid-intensity`, `gestural-narrative`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` or `adaptive-extend`
- **Material Physics Authority:** Oil on canvas with Chinese/Permanent White priming; watercolour with bodycolour (gouache) for opacity
- **Detail Philosophy:** "Truth to nature" = microscopic observation throughout - studying limb for limb, hand for hand, finger for finger
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity; no real logos/watermarks/signatures
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** All figures fully clothed in period-appropriate medieval/classical garments; floor-length minimum coverage
- **Gender expression:** **CRITICAL - Respect presented gender.** Masculine subjects = medieval/classical masculine wardrobe. Feminine subjects = medieval/classical feminine wardrobe. Match styling to presented gender.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital filters; authentic oil/watercolour surface with white ground luminosity
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid idealized Raphaelesque beauty, theatrical staging, generalization, conventional prettiness
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail
- **STRICT TERMINATION:** Framework ends at Section 8. DO NOT add content beyond Section 8.

------

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- **RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **3:4**. This is a hard requirement.
- Redraw in **Dante Gabriel Rossetti Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood style** for **museum gallery oil painting on canvas with white ground technique**.
- Identity via Rossettian archetype: enigmatic psychological interiority, idiosyncratic features over idealized beauty, languid intensity.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original literary/medieval character designs from public domain sources (Dante, Keats, Tennyson, Bible, Arthurian legend).
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `white-ground-luminosity` - Chinese/Permanent White priming with transparent glazes
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` or `languid-intensity`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Safety Mandate:** All figures fully clothed in period-appropriate medieval/classical garments with floor-length coverage, modest necklines.
- **Style Dominance:** White ground oil technique creating jewel-like luminosity, microscopic detail commitment throughout (every leaf, finger, fabric fold individually studied), Rossettian female archetype (languid psychological intensity, voluminous red-blonde/auburn hair, full lips 110-120%, enigmatic gaze), delirious scarlet lilies color palette, literary/medieval narrative, rejection of idealized Raphaelesque beauty, truth to nature through painful observation. **CRITICAL: Respect presented gender - masculine/feminine subjects receive appropriate period wardrobe.**
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery
- **Final Ratio Confirmation:** Output must be exactly **3:4 ratio**, no exceptions.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**RATIO SELECTION:** `3:4` (portrait - 864×1184) - Native NanoBanana support, no adaptation required

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Ratio Status:** Native 3:4 portrait format
- **Reframing Method:** Tight figure framing or flat patterned background extension
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure dominates frame (minimal negative space for single figures, dense crowding for multiple figures)
- **Background Treatment:** Medieval tapestry-like flat patterns with meticulous symbolic elements OR naturalistic detail with microscopic botanical accuracy - both approaches equally valid
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 portrait ratio serves PRB's tight psychological compositions, vertical emphasis suits commanding figure presence, allows either intimate proximity or dense narrative complexity

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Rebellion against post-Raphaelesque academic art; Early Italian masters (Orcagna, Campo Santo frescoes); Northern Renaissance (Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait - minute exactitude, layered symbolism); Sandro Botticelli (graceful movement, avoidance of conventional beauty - Rossetti's personal rediscovery); Literary sources (Dante, Keats, Tennyson, Chaucer); Medieval manuscript illumination

**Medium/Production Method:** Oil on canvas OR watercolour with bodycolour (gouache) for opacity. **REVOLUTIONARY WHITE GROUND TECHNIQUE:** Canvas/board primed with brilliant Chinese White (zinc oxide) or Permanent White. Light passes through transparent/semi-opaque paint layers, reflects from white ground, radiates back creating jewel-like luminosity impossible with traditional dark grounds. This optical innovation is the foundational Pre-Raphaelite technical breakthrough. Meticulous blending with fine sable brushes for faces (invisible brushstrokes). Mix of smooth glazes and textured bodycolour for drapery. Scratching-out technique for highlights (Rossetti innovation). Gum Arabic added to heighten color intensity. Tools: sable brushes (detail), hog's hair brushes (texture/bodycolour), scratching implements. Additives: ox gall (watercolour flow), watercolour megilp (oil-paint texture in watercolour), Rouget's fixative (charcoal/pencil fixing). Enthusiastic adoption of new 19th-century pigments despite some fugitivity concerns.

**Thematic Purpose:** Revolutionary commitment to "truth to nature" through microscopic observation as moral/philosophical imperative. Literary and medieval themes rendered with modern psychological realism. Rejection of theatrical academic staging and idealized beauty in favor of idiosyncratic character and intense emotional interiority. Breaking barriers between visual art and literature (Rossetti wrote sonnets accompanying paintings).

**Hallmark Motifs with Quantified Specifications:**

1. **White Ground Luminosity:** Chinese/Permanent White priming creates optical light reflection through paint layers, producing jewel-like color intensity unmatched by contemporaries using traditional dark grounds
2. **Rossettian Female Archetype:** "Languid, flesh and bones figures - most desirable and most frightening" with voluminous cascading red-blonde/auburn hair, strong defined jawline, full lips (110-120% standard proportion), large heavy-lidded eyes, enigmatic distant gaze creating psychological interiority
3. **Microscopic Detail Commitment:** "Painful" application studying every element individually - limb for limb, hand for hand, finger for finger, including natural "accidents" (wind damage, rain effects, imperfections)
4. **Delirious Scarlet Lilies Palette:** Brilliant jewel-tone reds (Madder Carmine, Vermilion #DC143C, #E34234), pure greens with unexpected reflections (Oxide of Chromium #2F4F2F, #3CB371), deep blues (Cobalt, French Ultramarine #00008B, #4169E1), gold metallics for medieval illumination effects
5. **Symbolic Literary Narrative:** Every element carries meaning - no decorative filler; backgrounds as flat medieval patterns OR meticulous natural detail, both approaches symbolic and narrative-driven

**Period Framing:** Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood founding (1848) through Rossetti's mature period (1860s-1882), Royal Academy training consciously rejected, en plein air outdoor painting for natural authenticity, studio use of lay figures for complex poses, pioneering white ground technique and 19th-century pigment innovation

**Tone Tag:** Psychologically intense, enigmatically interior, symbolically rich, microscopically detailed, anti-academic

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Painting Technique Anchors:**

1. **White Ground Revolutionary Technique:** Prime canvas/board with brilliant Chinese White (zinc oxide) or Permanent White creating luminous foundation. Apply oil paint in transparent to semi-opaque layers allowing light to pass through, reflect from white ground, and radiate back creating jewel-like luminosity. This optical effect is impossible with traditional dark grounds and defines PRB color intensity. Gum Arabic added to colors to heighten intensity and create varnish-like sheen.
2. **Microscopic Detail Philosophy - Truth to Nature:** Commit to "painful" application studying every element individually. Method documented by Frederic George Stephens: "studying them one after the other, limb for limb, hand for hand, finger for finger, noting each inflection of joint, or tension of sinew." Foreground receives maximum individual texture rendering. Midground maintains detail without simplification. Background receives equal commitment whether flat symbolic pattern OR meticulous natural observation - both approaches microscopically detailed. Include naturalistic "accidents": wind and rain effects on foliage, subtle reflections on water and polished surfaces, complex natural color variations.
3. **Face Rendering - Invisible Brushwork:** Use fine sable brushes with meticulous wet-on-wet blending creating smooth surface with minimal to invisible brushstrokes. Multiple thin transparent glazes for skin translucency and luminosity. Microscopic precision: individual eyelash definition, iris color variation visible, lip contour individually studied. Reject idealized Raphaelesque beauty - embrace idiosyncratic, character-filled features reflecting particularity of real individuals.
4. **Drapery and Fabric Physics:** Mix smooth transparent glazes with opaque bodycolour (Chinese White mixed with colors). Each fabric fold individually studied and rendered following gravitational logic. Build sheen through multiple glazes for silk. Use opaque bodycolour for matte fabrics. Gold powder or gold shells for metallic details (armor, halos) emulating medieval manuscript illumination. Scratching-out technique: physically remove paint layers with tools to create highlights in watercolour and bodycolour work.
5. **19th-Century Pigment Innovation:** Enthusiastically adopt new brilliant pigments despite some fugitivity concerns. Reds: Madder Carmine, Vermilion, Extract of Vermilion. Yellows: Cadmium Yellow, Strontium Yellow, Chrome Yellow (fugitive but used for brilliance). Blues: Cobalt Blue, Antwerp Blue, French Ultramarine (synthetic replacement for expensive lapis). Greens: Oxide of Chromium (stable ready-mixed green). Metallics: Gold Powder, Gold Shells, Aluminium Cakes. These pigments on white ground create "fascinating quality of colour" with unprecedented brightness.

**Pose Anchors:**

- **Psychological Tension Externalized:** Poses convey internal emotional states through precise physical detail. Example: "The Awakening Conscience" method - lips drawn, nostrils retracted and expanded, cheek hard-set, hands clutched so tightly trinkets drive into flesh. Every gesture psychologically motivated by narrative, never theatrical or artificially graceful.
- **Languid Rossettian Intensity:** Female archetype displays relaxed posture with psychological weight, distant enigmatic gaze not engaging viewer, body language self-contained and mysteriously interior rather than animated or performative
- **Hand Articulation - Primary Psychological Vehicle:** Individual finger articulation visible, joint inflection precisely rendered, tension manifesting internal conflict. Hands never passive - always narratively and psychologically motivated.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Rossettian female proportions: lips 110-120% standard fullness, eyes large and heavy-lidded for psychological intensity, jawline strong and defined (not delicate classical ideal), chin pronounced (avoiding conventional beauty), neck 100-110% standard (substantial not fragile). Hair volume exceptional with individual strand definition in foreground. Male figures idealized but psychologically present when depicting medieval/literary archetypes.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Oil on canvas with white ground priming OR watercolour with bodycolour on Whatman paper (hot-pressed for detail). No digital smoothing or modern post-processing. Surface exhibits authentic medium characteristics: white ground luminosity, gum Arabic sheen, scratching-out highlight texture, invisible face brushwork contrasting with visible drapery strokes.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All technical methods authentic to 1848-1882 Pre-Raphaelite practice including white ground innovation, 19th-century pigment adoption, en plein air outdoor painting for natural subjects, microscopic detail commitment throughout, rejection of academic dark ground and idealized beauty conventions.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 3:4 portrait ratio with either tight figure framing (minimal negative space, commanding presence) OR dense multi-figure crowding (medieval manuscript influence, overlapping forms). Background as flat medieval pattern OR naturalistic detail - both microscopically rendered.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**CRITICAL: Gender Expression Respect - Match wardrobe track to presented gender in source image or user specification.**

**Wardrobe Tracks - SAFETY CALIBRATED FOR NO NUDITY:**

**Adult Feminine:**

- **Medieval Literary:** Floor-length robes and gowns in jewel-tone silks and velvets - deep crimson (#DC143C), rich green (#2F4F2F), royal blue (#00008B). Complex drapery with individually studied folds. Modest necklines, varied sleeves (long, flowing, or fitted). Fabric behavior: silk shows high sheen through multiple glazes, velvet shows matte richness through bodycolour opacity.
- **Classical Draped:** Full-length chitons and peplos with complete coverage, proper Greek/Roman draping physics. White linen or jewel-tone silk. Shoulder pinning, waist belts creating compression points for authentic fold patterns.
- **Arthurian/Chaucerian:** Medieval gowns with fitted bodices, flowing skirts to floor, long sleeves, modest coverage. Rich fabric colors enhanced by white ground luminosity.

**Adult Masculine:**

- **Medieval/Arthurian:** Knee-to-floor length tunics in rich colors (burgundy, forest green, deep blue). Long cloaks, hoods. For knights: period-accurate armor with gold metallic details (gold powder/shells), surcoats, chainmail visible. Hose and boots.
- **Classical:** Full-length togas or himations draped over tunics. White linen or rich earth tones. Proper Roman/Greek draping.
- **Dante/Literary:** Poet/scholar robes, long tunics, rich fabrics appropriate to literary archetype.

**Youth (Any Gender):**

- Simple tunics or robes, knee to floor length depending on age
- Modest period-appropriate styling
- Rich colors but simpler construction

**Fabric Behavior Physics:**

- **Silk:** High sheen through transparent glazes, fluid complex folds, jewel-tone colors intensified by white ground
- **Velvet:** Matte rich surface through opaque bodycolour, heavy drape, deep saturated colors
- **Linen:** Crisp folds, matte to slight sheen, typically white or natural tones
- **Brocade/Embroidered:** Gold metallic threads using gold powder/shells, complex patterns individually detailed

**Accessory Caps:** Elaborate 3-4 items maximum - every element symbolic

- **Jewelry:** Necklaces, bracelets, rings, crowns - gold metallic rendering, gemstones in jewel tones, symbolic narrative function
- **Headwear:** Crowns, circlets, veils, medieval hoods - rich materials, gold details
- **Hair Ornament:** Flowers woven into hair (botanically accurate species), ribbons, jeweled pins
- **Footwear:** Period-appropriate or barefoot

**Color Palette Restrictions:** Jewel-tone dominance from white ground luminosity - delirious scarlet reds, pure vivid greens, deep intense blues, gold metallics. Reject muted or pastel tones. Embrace "fascinating quality of colour" from 19th-century pigments on white ground.

**Wardrobe Variation Required:** Change primary garment colors between iterations - cycle through crimson silk, emerald velvet, sapphire draping, gold brocade. Every element individually studied and symbolically meaningful.

**Props:** 1 hero + optional 1 micro (total ≤2) - all symbolic

**Hero Props (choose 1):**

```yaml
literary_symbolic:
  - book_manuscript (illuminated medieval, every letter/decoration detailed)
  - scroll (parchment texture, calligraphy precision)
  - letter (narrative significance, handwriting visible)
  - mirror (polished metal, symbolic self-reflection)

natural_symbolic:
  - single_flower (rose, lily, poppy - botanically accurate, symbolic meaning)
  - fruit (apple, pomegranate - narrative/symbolic function)
  - branch_with_flowers (individual petal/leaf detail)

musical_poetic:
  - lute (medieval construction detail, string precision)
  - harp (ornate decoration, functional accuracy)
  - bells (gold metallic rendering)

medieval_objects:
  - chalice (gold metallic, jeweled decoration)
  - sword (Arthurian context, blade detail)
  - crown (gold filigree, gemstone precision)
  - reliquary (ornate medieval craftsmanship)
```

**Micro Props (optional, choose 0-1):**

```yaml
scattered_symbolic:
  - flower_petals (individual botanical accuracy, 3-5 petals)
  - small_bird (symbolic dove, robin - feather detail)
  - butterfly (wing pattern precision)
  - ivy_tendril (leaf vein detail, natural growth)
```

**Coherence Filter:** All elements serve literary/symbolic narrative function derived from Dante, Keats, Tennyson, Chaucer, Bible, or Arthurian legend. If props don't advance symbolic story, default to clean scene with rich fabric and background focus.

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (3:4 Portrait Format):**

- Vertical emphasis with figure commanding frame
- Single figure: tight framing with minimal negative space, large dominant scale
- Multiple figures: dense crowding with overlapping forms, medieval manuscript compression
- Shallow picture plane - figures pressed forward toward viewer creating psychological immediacy
- Head placement: centered to slightly off-center for psychological intensity
- Negative space: minimal for single figures (10-20%), filled with symbolic/narrative elements

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective Regime:** Deliberate perspective scale planned to "conceive the thing as it really must have happened" (documented method for Ecce Ancilla Domini!). Measured believable space but reject theatrical academic staging. Intimate claustrophobic proximity creates psychological immediacy.

- **Figure:Ground Ratio:** Single figures dominate frame at 80-90% canvas occupation with minimal background. Multiple figures create dense crowded compositions with 90%+ figure occupation, shallow compressed space, medieval manuscript influence.

- **Background Treatment - Two Equally Valid Approaches:**

  **FLAT MEDIEVAL PATTERN (Anti-Academic Rejection of Depth):**

  - Tapestry-like repeating motifs against dark or gold ground
  - Individual flowers/stars/decorative elements microscopically detailed
  - Every element symbolic and narratively meaningful
  - Gold metallic details using gold powder/shells
  - Rejection of atmospheric perspective in favor of symbolic flattening

  **NATURALISTIC MICROSCOPIC DETAIL (Truth to Nature):**

  - Painted en plein air outdoors for authenticity
  - Botanical accuracy: species-specific leaf shapes, individual petal rendering
  - Natural "accidents" deliberately included: wind damage, rain effects, growth imperfections
  - No atmospheric fading or simplification - equal detail throughout depth
  - Every blade of grass individually observed and rendered
  - Water reflections, polished surface effects, complex natural color variations

- **Detail Hierarchy:** NO HIERARCHY - microscopic commitment throughout all spatial planes. Foreground, midground, background all receive individual study. "Painful" application of detail as moral/philosophical imperative, not decorative choice.

- **Lighting Logic:** Natural light supporting white ground luminosity. Soft to moderate intensity preserving jewel-tone color brilliance. Avoid harsh theatrical lighting or academic chiaroscuro. Light serves symbolic narrative and color intensity, not dramatic modeling.

**ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:**

**Flat Symbolic Backgrounds:**

- Medieval tapestry patterns with repeating floral/stellar motifs
- Dark grounds (#1A1A1A to #2F4F2F) or gold metallics
- Individual symbolic elements: roses, lilies, stars, vines - each microscopically detailed
- Compression of space - anti-academic flattening
- Every element carries literary/symbolic meaning (no decorative filler)

**Naturalistic Detailed Settings:**

- **Medieval Interiors:** Gothic/Romanesque architecture with measured perspective, domestic objects as narrative clues (Van Eyck influence), symbolic furnishings, natural light from windows
- **Gardens/Forests:** Botanical accuracy throughout, individual leaf vein detail, natural growth patterns with imperfections, en plein air observation, wind/rain effects visible
- **Domestic Victorian:** Contemporary settings with same microscopic detail as historical subjects, social commentary through precise object rendering

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Oil on canvas with white ground priming OR watercolour with bodycolour on Whatman paper
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT ENTIRELY - no decorative frames or bands (violates PRB anti-academic stance)
- **Production Context Anchor:** Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood revolutionary technique (1848-1882) with white ground luminosity, microscopic detail commitment, rejection of theatrical staging
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed for 3:4 portrait ratio with tight figure dominance OR dense crowding, vertical emphasis, psychological immediacy through compressed space

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Conditional — Rossetti occasionally integrated text through painted inscriptions and poetic fragments.

**If Literary Context Requires Text Integration:**

- **Inscription Style:** Medieval manuscript lettering rendered as gilded or painted cartouches, functioning as symbolic narrative elements rather than modern typography.
- **Sonnet Fragments:** Limit to 1-2 short phrases (≤6 words) that feel like Rossettian poetry; placement must harmonize with floral or architectural framing.
- **Letterform Guidance:** Hand-lettered, archaic scripts emulating illuminated manuscript calligraphy. Avoid modern fonts or mechanically perfect lettering.

**Default for Most Compositions:** OMIT. Rossetti typically kept the painted surface free of text, reserving poetry for accompanying sonnets rather than the canvas itself.

**Museum Gallery Standard:** Maintain a clean painted surface unless a specific literary subject historically included integrated inscriptions for symbolic completeness.
