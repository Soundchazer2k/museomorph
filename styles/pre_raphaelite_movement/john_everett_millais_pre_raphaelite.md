# John Everett Millais - Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood Framework

**Timeframe:** 1848-1856 (Early Pre-Raphaelite Period)
 **Historical Context:** John Everett Millais was a co-founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (established 1847), revolutionizing British art through rejection of academic conventions. His signature innovation: "pictorial ecosystems"—self-contained hyper-realistic worlds where environment receives 80-90% detail intensity of foreground (vs. academic 20-30%), creating uniform focus across depth planes. Figures and botanical elements achieve near-equal precision throughout the canvas. Trained at Royal Academy Schools, he consciously rebelled against idealized beauty, theatrical staging, and atmospheric background blur. Technical analysis reveals: fine closely-woven canvas (25 threads/cm with visible slubs), double priming (calcium carbonate base + lead white with red ochre tint creating warm luminous ground), thinly applied paint with selective impasto highlights, 19th-century pigment innovations (chrome yellow, cadmium yellow, emerald green, cobalt blue), chemical instabilities causing transparency increases over time through saponification. Poses narrative-driven with physical tension externalizing psychological states.

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement Protocol:** Combat resistance through explicit ratio declaration in multiple locations, repetitive reinforcement, negative constraints, compositional anchors.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via naturalistic anatomy (100-105% standard proportions) and narrative-driven poses, not idealized beauty.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("80-90% background detail intensity", "25 threads/cm canvas", "uniform saturation across depth") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Uniform detail distribution and botanical accuracy supersede visual shortcuts.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean` with double-primed warm ground
- **Pose Flags:** `narrative-tension`, `naturalistic-strain`, `psychological-externalization`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` or `adaptive-extend`
- **Detail Philosophy:** CRITICAL - "Pictorial ecosystem" = 80-90% background detail vs foreground, rejecting academic 20-30% diminishment
- **Material Physics Authority:** Oil on fine canvas (25 threads/cm), double priming (calcium carbonate + lead white/red ochre), thin paint with selective impasto
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity; no logos/watermarks/signatures
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** All figures fully clothed in period-appropriate naturalistic garments; floor-length minimum
- **Gender expression:** **CRITICAL - Respect presented gender.** Match wardrobe to presented gender with naturalistic historical accuracy.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital filters; authentic oil surface with warm ground showing through thin layers
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas (arched tops acceptable as period format)
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid blurred backgrounds, atmospheric fade, generalized foliage, idealized beauty, depth-of-field blur
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail
- **STRICT TERMINATION:** Framework ends at Section 8. DO NOT add content beyond Section 8.

------

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **4:5 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- **RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **4:5**. This is a hard requirement.
- Redraw in **John Everett Millais Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood pictorial ecosystem style** for **museum gallery oil painting on fine canvas with double warm ground**.
- Identity via naturalistic anatomy (100-105% standard proportions), narrative-driven poses with physical tension, and environmental integration.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original narrative scenes from public domain literature (Shakespeare, Tennyson, biblical subjects, medieval legends).
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean` with double priming (calcium carbonate + lead white/red ochre warm ground)
- **Pose Flag:** `narrative-tension` or `naturalistic-strain`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Safety Mandate:** All figures fully clothed in historically accurate period garments with floor-length coverage minimum.
- **Style Dominance:** Pictorial ecosystem with 80-90% background detail intensity (vs academic 20-30%), uniform saturation across depth planes rejecting atmospheric fade, botanical accuracy throughout all spatial layers, naturalistic anatomy 100-105% standard proportions rejecting idealization, narrative-driven poses with visible physical tension/strain externalizing psychological states, fine canvas (25 threads/cm) with double warm ground (calcium carbonate + lead white/red ochre), thinly applied paint with selective impasto highlights, 19th-century pigment palette creating rich saturated colors maintained throughout depth. **CRITICAL: Respect presented gender - masculine/feminine subjects receive appropriate period wardrobe with naturalistic historical accuracy.**
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery
- **Final Ratio Confirmation:** Output must be exactly **4:5 ratio**, no exceptions.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**RATIO SELECTION:** `4:5` (portrait - 896×1152) - Native NanoBanana support, no adaptation required

**ALTERNATIVE RATIOS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL DOMINANCE:**

- `3:2` (landscape - 1248×832) for Ophelia-style environmental immersion
- `16:9` (landscape - 1344×768) for multi-figure narrative scenes

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Ratio Status:** Native 4:5 portrait format (or 3:2 landscape for environmental dominance)
- **Reframing Method:** Integrate figure into environment as embedded participant, not imposed subject
- **Spatial Allocation:** Portrait mode: Figure 60-70%, environment 30-40% (both highly detailed). Landscape mode: Figure 30-40%, environment 60-70% (pictorial ecosystem balance).
- **Background Treatment:** Botanical accuracy with 80-90% detail intensity of foreground - individual leaf rendering, species-specific flora, microscopic observation throughout depth
- **Format Justification:** 4:5 portrait serves tight figure-environment integration with both elements detailed. 3:2 landscape serves environmental immersion where nature equals narrative importance (Ophelia model).

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Rebellion against post-Raphaelesque academic idealization; Early Italian and Flemish precision; Botanical illustration scientific accuracy; Literary narrative (Shakespeare, Tennyson, medieval romance); Working-class social realism (Christ in carpenter shop controversy)

**Medium/Production Method:** Oil on fine closely-woven canvas (25 threads/cm with prominent slubs - texture subtly visible through thin paint). **DOUBLE PRIMING TECHNIQUE:** First layer calcium carbonate with some lead white (thick), second layer lead white tinted with red ochre creating warm luminous ground. Thinly applied oil paint (linseed oil, P/S ratio ~1) allowing ground luminosity to influence colors. Purchased Roberson's medium (oil + mastic/copal resins) altering handling properties. Selective impasto white paint for bright textured highlights (jewels, light peaks). Transparent wash glazing for depth and candlelit effects. Pencil grid transfer from preparatory drawing (graphite lines sometimes visible where paint failed to wet). **Chemical authenticity:** Saponification of lead white/zinc white with fatty acids creates transparency increase and darkening over time - simulate aged surface with subtle underlying layer visibility.

**Thematic Purpose:** Revolutionary "truth to nature" through microscopic uniform observation rejecting academic hierarchy. Literary and historical narratives rendered with uncompromising realism causing contemporary controversy (working-class Holy Family). Environmental elements as active narrative participants, not passive backdrops. Psychological states externalized through physically strained poses.

**Hallmark Motifs with Quantified Specifications:**

1. **Pictorial Ecosystem Balance:** Environment receives 80-90% detail intensity of foreground (measured in Ophelia: distant trees show individual leaf masses vs academic generalized blur). Figure-environment integration: landscape mode 30-40% figure / 60-70% environment, both microscopically detailed.
2. **Uniform Detail Across Depth:** Background botanical accuracy equals foreground precision - individual species identification possible throughout spatial planes. Reject atmospheric desaturation, depth-of-field blur, generalized masses. Maintain color saturation richness from foreground through background.
3. **Naturalistic Anatomical Proportions:** 100-105% standard human proportions rejecting classical idealization. Face: eyes 100-105%, nose 100%, lips 100-110%, natural variation preserved. Body: neck 100-105%, all other proportions 100% standard. Idiosyncratic character over uniform beauty.
4. **Narrative-Driven Physical Tension:** Poses show visible strain externalizing psychological states - Huguenot embrace with diagonal instability and conflicting head directions, Mariana backward arch 30-40° creating physical discomfort = yearning, Ophelia horizontal surrender with no tension = acceptance.
5. **19th-Century Pigment Richness:** Chrome yellow, cadmium yellow (bright but fugitive), emerald green, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, vermilion, red lakes creating saturated colors maintained uniformly across depth. Earth tones (red ochre, umber, yellow ochre) for naturalistic elements.

**Period Framing:** Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood founding (1847-1848) through Millais's stylistic divergence (mid-1850s), Royal Academy training consciously rejected, outdoor observation for botanical accuracy, studio lay figures for complex pose holding, double warm ground innovation, 19th-century industrial pigment adoption

**Tone Tag:** Uncompromising naturalistic, botanically precise, narratively intense, environmentally integrated, anti-academic

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Painting Technique Anchors:**

1. **Double Warm Ground Foundation:** Prime fine canvas (25 threads/cm with visible slubs) with first thick layer calcium carbonate + some lead white, then second thin layer lead white tinted with red ochre. This warm luminous ground influences all subsequent color layers, reflecting light back through thinly applied paint creating characteristic glow. Canvas texture subtly visible where paint thinnest.
2. **Uniform Detail Distribution - Pictorial Ecosystem Mandate:** Apply 80-90% background detail intensity compared to foreground (vs academic 20-30% diminishment). Botanical accuracy throughout all depth planes: distant trees show individual leaf masses and branch structures, midground vegetation receives species-specific rendering, foreground elements get microscopic petal/blade precision. **CRITICAL:** Constrain AI attention mechanism to reject conventional depth-of-field - apply near-uniform detail resolution across entire composition avoiding blur at distance.
3. **Thin Paint Application with Selective Impasto:** Apply oil paint in thin layers allowing warm ground to glow through, creating luminosity and color richness. Reserve impasto (thick textured application) for selective bright highlights: jewel facets, light peaks on metallic surfaces, peak fabric folds. Use transparent wash glazing (thinned paint) for depth effects and candlelit atmospheres. Paint thickness: primarily 1-2mm, impasto highlights 3-5mm maximum.
4. **Botanical and Material Precision:** Render every natural element with species-specific accuracy - identifiable flower types (roses, poppies, forget-me-nots, willow, reeds), leaf venation patterns visible, individual grass blades distinguishable. Fabric and material surfaces show authentic behavior: velvet matte richness, silk sheen, embroidery pattern detail, metallic armor reflections. Study each element individually before rendering.
5. **Chemical Aging Authenticity (Optional Simulation):** Simulate saponification effects where lead white/zinc white reacts with oil binder fatty acids: subtle transparency increase in white-rich areas revealing warm ground beneath, slight darkening of hue, underlying pencil grid occasionally visible where paint didn't wet graphite lines. This creates aged Pre-Raphaelite surface character.

**Pose Anchors:**

- **Narrative Tension Externalized:** Physical strain = psychological state. Huguenot model: tense embrace with diagonal body angles creating instability, woman's hands on man's chest showing resistance, heads tilted in conflicting directions = visual separation within physical contact
- **Naturalistic Strain:** Mariana model: backward spinal arch 30-40° reaching toward window, physically uncomfortable position = emotional yearning and frustration, sustained pose showing endurance
- **Surrender/Acceptance:** Ophelia model: horizontal floating with complete body relaxation, no muscular tension, open hands releasing not grasping = psychological resignation

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Naturalistic proportions 100-105% standard - neck subtle elongation in some figures (100-105%), all other anatomy 100% accurate. Hands 100-105% with detailed finger joint articulation. Reject idealized elongation, classical contrapposto, or uniform stylization. Preserve individual human variation and character-specific features.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Fine canvas weave (25 threads/cm) texture subtly visible, double warm ground (red ochre tint) showing through thin paint, oil binding medium authentic handling, selective impasto highlights, transparent glazing, no digital smoothing or modern post-processing.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All methods authentic to 1848-1856 Pre-Raphaelite practice: double priming innovation, thin oil application, 19th-century pigment palette, outdoor botanical observation, narrative literary sources, rejection of academic idealization and atmospheric blur.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for declared ratio with figure-environment balance: portrait 4:5 for 60-70% figure integration, landscape 3:2 for 30-40% figure environmental immersion. Both formats maintain 80-90% background detail intensity.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**CRITICAL: Gender Expression Respect - Match wardrobe track to presented gender with naturalistic historical accuracy.**

**Wardrobe Tracks - SAFETY CALIBRATED FOR NO NUDITY:**

**Adult Feminine:**

- **Medieval/Elizabethan:** Floor-length gowns with fitted bodices, flowing skirts, long sleeves or puffed sleeves. Rich velvets (#1A1A1A, #2C2C2C), silk embroidery patterns individually rendered. White collars/cuffs (#F5F5DC). Period-accurate construction with authentic drape.
- **Victorian/Contemporary (1850s):** Floor-length day dresses, modest necklines, long sleeves, rich fabric colors (deep blues #4B0082, burgundy #8B3A3A, forest green #2F4F2F). Embroidery and pattern detail individually studied.
- **Classical/Romantic:** Flowing robes to floor, draped fabric with authentic gravitational physics, muted earth tones or jewel tones, modest coverage throughout.

**Adult Masculine:**

- **Medieval/Renaissance:** Knee-to-floor tunics, hose, boots, rich velvets and brocades. For nobility/knights: period-accurate armor with detailed metallic rendering, surcoats, cloaks.
- **Victorian (1850s):** Frock coats, waistcoats, trousers, period-accurate tailoring. Working class: simple shirts, work clothes with authentic wear/texture.
- **Classical/Historical:** Robes, tunics appropriate to narrative period, authentic construction and draping.

**Youth (Any Gender):**

- Period-appropriate simple garments, knee-to-floor length
- Naturalistic historical accuracy
- Modest coverage appropriate to age and narrative

**Fabric Behavior Physics:**

- **Velvet:** Matte rich surface, heavy drape, deep saturated colors (#1A1A1A blacks, #4B0082 purples)
- **Silk:** High sheen through glazing, fluid complex folds, embroidery pattern detail individually rendered
- **Linen:** Crisp folds, matte to slight sheen, white/cream tones (#F5F5DC)
- **Wool:** Heavy natural drape, earth tone colors, authentic period weave texture

**Accessory Caps:** Minimal 0-2 items - naturalistic integration

- **Jewelry:** Simple period-appropriate pieces with impasto highlight rendering
- **Headwear:** Period caps, crowns, wreaths - historically accurate
- **Footwear:** Often barefoot (100% natural proportions), or period shoes/sandals

**Color Palette:** Earth tones + rich saturated jewel tones maintained across depth - greens (#2D5016, #4A7C2F, #6B9B4C), blues (#1E4D6B, #4682B4), reds (#8B3A3A, vermilion), yellows (chrome/cadmium), blacks (#1A1A1A). **CRITICAL:** Maintain color saturation uniformly - no atmospheric desaturation at distance.

**Wardrobe Variation Required:** Cycle through period-appropriate colors and styles avoiding identical repetition.

**Props:** 1 hero + optional 1 micro (total ≤2) - narrative function

**Hero Props (choose 1):**

```yaml
botanical_natural:
  - individual_flower_species (rose, poppy, lily, forget-me-not - botanically accurate)
  - flowering_branch (species-specific leaf/petal detail)
  - laurel_wreath (individual leaf rendering)
  
narrative_objects:
  - book_manuscript (period binding, page texture)
  - mirror (reflective surface with impasto highlights)
  - sword_dagger (metallic detail, period-accurate)
  - chalice_vessel (metallic or ceramic with surface precision)
  
environmental_integration:
  - lantern_candlelight (glazed glow effect)
  - musical_instrument (lute, harp - construction detail)
```

**Micro Props (optional, choose 0-1):**

```yaml
scattered_elements:
  - flower_petals (3-5 individual botanically accurate petals)
  - small_fauna (bird, butterfly - detailed rendering)
  - ivy_tendril (leaf venation visible)
```

**Coherence Filter:** All elements serve narrative literary function (Shakespeare, Tennyson, biblical, medieval legend). Botanical accuracy throughout. If props don't advance story, default to environmental botanical detail focus.

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**For 4:5 Portrait Format:**

- Vertical emphasis with figure 60-70% canvas occupation
- Environment 30-40% but receives 80-90% detail intensity of figure
- Integration: figure embedded in botanical context, not imposed on backdrop
- Head placement upper third, environmental detail surrounds and interacts

**For 3:2 Landscape Format (Environmental Dominance):**

- Horizontal emphasis with figure 30-40% canvas occupation
- Environment 60-70% as equal narrative participant (Ophelia model)
- Integration: figure immersed in detailed natural world
- Botanical accuracy throughout depth - distant trees individually rendered

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective Regime:** Realistic linear perspective with measured spatial recession. Environment tangible and believable but maintains detail throughout depth. Reject academic atmospheric blur - sustain botanical precision foreground to background.
- **Figure:Ground Relationship - Pictorial Ecosystem:** Portrait mode: 60-70% figure, 30-40% environment (both highly detailed). Landscape mode: 30-40% figure, 60-70% environment (figure embedded as ecosystem participant). **CRITICAL:** Environment not backdrop - active narrative element with 80-90% detail intensity.
- **Uniform Detail Distribution Mandate:** Foreground: microscopic precision (individual flower petals, grass blades, fabric embroidery stitches). Midground: maintained precision (species-specific foliage, submerged vegetation structure). Background: 80-90% detail intensity (distant tree leaf masses visible, branch patterns distinguishable, far bank botanical elements rendered). **Reject depth-of-field blur, atmospheric generalization, simplified masses.**
- **Color Saturation Uniformity:** Maintain rich saturated colors throughout depth planes. Greens (#2D5016 to #8FBC5E), blues (#1E4D6B to #4682B4), florals (whites #E8E8E8, purples #C8B4D6, yellows #B8860B) - all colors sustain intensity from foreground through background. **Reject atmospheric desaturation.**
- **Lighting Logic:** Natural outdoor light or candlelit interior creating authentic shadows and highlights. Light serves botanical detail revelation, not dramatic chiaroscuro obscuring. Selective impasto highlights on light peaks (water reflections, metallic surfaces, peak fabric folds).

**ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:**

**Natural Outdoor (Preferred for Pictorial Ecosystem):**

- **Riverbank/Waterscape:** Individual water plant species (reeds, irises, water lilies with leaf structure detail), submerged vegetation visible, bank flora botanically accurate, distant trees show leaf mass patterns, floating flowers individually rendered (Ophelia model)
- **Forest/Garden:** Individual tree species identifiable, leaf venation visible on foreground elements, branch structures throughout depth, botanical ground cover with species accuracy, ivy showing individual leaf shapes
- **Meadow/Field:** Grass types distinguishable, wildflower species accurate (poppies, daisies, forget-me-nots), individual blade rendering foreground, maintained detail to horizon

**Interior Settings:**

- **Medieval/Gothic:** Stone texture detail, stained glass with pattern precision, wooden furnishings showing grain/construction, candlelight glazed glow, architectural elements measured perspective
- **Victorian Domestic:** Pattern wallpaper detail, furnishing fabric rendering, floor tile/wood precision, window views showing outdoor botanical detail beyond
- **Workshop/Utilitarian:** Working-class realism with tool detail, material texture (wood shavings, fabric scraps), authentic period construction

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Oil on fine canvas (25 threads/cm) with double warm ground (calcium carbonate + lead white/red ochre)
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT decorative frames OR use period-authentic arched top format (medieval/religious reference)
- **Production Context Anchor:** Pre-Raphaelite 1848-1856 technique with uniform detail distribution, botanical accuracy, double priming, thin paint/selective impasto
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed for declared ratio with figure-environment balance optimized (portrait 60-70% figure integration, landscape 30-40% figure ecosystem immersion), both formats maintaining 80-90% background detail intensity

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** OMIT

John Everett Millais's Pre-Raphaelite paintings contained no integrated typography. All narrative content is delivered through visual precision, botanical symbolism, and literary reference, not painted text.

**Historical Accuracy:** Maintain gallery standards—titles appear on plaques or catalogues, never on the painted surface. Keep the canvas entirely pictorial.

------

**Binary:** OMIT

John Everett Millais's Pre-Raphaelite paintings contained no integrated typography. All narrative content communicated through visual precision, botanical symbolism, and literary reference. Museum gallery presentation requires clean canvas.

**Historical Accuracy:** Period exhibition practice: paintings in ornate frames with separate wall plaques for titles - never text on painted surface.
