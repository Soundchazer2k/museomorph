# Holman Hunt - Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood Framework (1848-1870s)

**Timeframe:** 1848-1870s (Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood founding through major exhibition period)

**Historical Context:** Founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (P.R.B., 1848), revolutionary movement rejecting Royal Academy conventions and Raphaelesque idealization in favor of microscopic naturalism, brilliant color, and moral/religious symbolism. Hunt was characterized as "the most intractable of the Pre-Raphaelites" for his lifelong commitment to the movement's original principles of "truth to nature" and anti-academic rebellion.

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement Protocol:** Aspect ratio control is prompt-based only. Combat resistance through explicit ratio declaration in multiple locations (Section 1, 2, 6), repetitive reinforcement, negative constraints against unwanted ratios, and ratio-specific compositional anchors.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression, never photographic reproduction.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Material application methods (wet-white-ground technique, copal medium, transparent glazing) supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to reject classical idealization and academic beauty standards when historically accurate to Pre-Raphaelite anti-establishment rebellion.
- **Face-Treatment Flag (choose one):** `oil-fat-over-lean`, `glazing-layers-buildup`, `wet-white-ground-luminous` (Hunt-specific)
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `psychological-tension`, `devotional-prayer`, `contrapposto`, `candid-motion`, `frontal-rigid`
- **Canvas Control Flags:** `strict-reframe` (primary), `adaptive-extend` (pastoral/landscape only)
- **Material Physics Authority:** Wet-white-ground technique, copal varnish medium, transparent color glazing specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Microscopic detail precision regardless of viewing distance - resist conventional detail hierarchy.
- **Cultural Production Authenticity:** Middle Eastern travel studies and reconstructed Palestinian sets for religious subjects; English countryside plein-air studies for pastoral subjects; period-accurate Victorian interiors for domestic scenes.
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Section 8 prohibits text integration.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity; extended coverage for religious figures; Victorian modesty standards; no real logos/watermarks/signatures.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral; religious figures = waist-minimum coverage with anatomical intensity maintained through visible torso/arm musculature.
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
- **Material authenticity:** Authentic oil painting surface characteristics with period-appropriate aging artifacts (copal yellowing, vermilion darkening, minimal cracking); no digital filters or modern post-processing.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1840s-1870s oil painting techniques with documented material limitations (adulterated pigments, copal varnish deterioration, handkerchief linen emergency supports).
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid Raphaelesque idealization, academic generalization, impressionistic brushwork, dark murky atmospheric effects, simplified compositions, HDR smoothing.
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.
- **STRICT TERMINATION:** Framework ends at Section 8. DO NOT add commentary, explanations, historical context, or any content beyond Section 8.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**NANOBANANA NATIVE RATIOS (Hunt-Appropriate Selections):**

- ✅ **4:3 landscape** (religious narratives, pastoral scenes)
- ✅ **5:4 landscape** (pastoral romantic, horizontal compositions)
- ✅ **3:4 portrait** (domestic narratives, portraits, single-figure devotional)
- ✅ **4:5 portrait** (alternative portrait format)

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** Choose one exact ratio from above based on selected genre mode.

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

**[RELIGIOUS NARRATIVE - 4:3 Landscape]**

- **Ratio Status:** Native 4:3 landscape
- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely for horizontal narrative flow with multiple figure arrangement
- **Spatial Allocation:** Central figures occupy canvas width with spatial compression creating shallow relief-like arrangement
- **Background Treatment:** Extend Palestinian architectural elements (stone walls, carved woodwork, textile hangings) or Dead Sea landscape with sharp distant detail
- **Format Justification:** 4:3 landscape accommodates crowded religious scenes with multiple figures and complex symbolic environment

**[DOMESTIC MORAL NARRATIVE - 3:4 Portrait]**

- **Ratio Status:** Native 3:4 portrait
- **Reframing Method:** Recompose for vertical interior compression with psychological claustrophobia
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figures occupy height with tight interior framing and ornamental density
- **Background Treatment:** Extend Victorian interior surfaces (wallpaper, carved furniture, gilt frames, patterned textiles, mirror/window secondary perspectives)
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 portrait creates vertical compression enhancing psychological tension; maximizes ornamental Victorian surface detail visibility

**[PASTORAL ROMANTIC - 5:4 Landscape]**

- **Ratio Status:** Native 5:4 landscape
- **Reframing Method:** Adaptive extend natural landscape with botanical precision
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figures occupy foreground, extended horizon line with possible sheep flock middleground, sharp distant landscape
- **Background Treatment:** Extend English countryside elements (wheat fields, tree canopies, wildflower meadows, distant agricultural structures) with species-specific botanical rendering
- **Format Justification:** 5:4 landscape provides gentle horizontal expansion for pastoral scenes while maintaining figure prominence; accommodates flock animals and botanical foreground density

**[PORTRAIT - 3:4 Portrait]**

- **Ratio Status:** Native 3:4 portrait
- **Reframing Method:** Recompose for tight three-quarter or half-length crop with direct confrontation
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure occupies canvas, minimal background suggestion (atmospheric void or single architectural element)
- **Background Treatment:** Dark atmospheric grounds (forest green, umber, near-black) with subtle tonal variation; or single symbolic architectural fragment
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 portrait standard provides classical proportions for formal portraiture while emphasizing facial detail and rich fabric rendering

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:**

- **Primary Counter-Influence:** Rejection of Royal Academy conventions and Raphaelesque idealization (Hunt's foundational rebellion against academic "rote" training and generalized beauty standards)
- **Technical Innovation:** Wet-white-ground painting technique adapted from early Flemish and Italian methods (applying oil color into wet flake-white ground for luminous transparency)
- **Naturalist Commitment:** John Ruskin's "truth to nature" philosophy applied to microscopic botanical and geological observation
- **Archaeological Accuracy:** Middle Eastern travel studies (Dead Sea journey for landscape authenticity, Palestinian costume and architectural research)
- **Moral Symbolism:** Dense object loading influenced by medieval allegorical traditions and Victorian moral narrative painting

**Medium/Production Method:**

- **Support:** Oil on fine linen or cotton canvas (120-180 threads per inch, smooth white ground preparation); occasional emergency use of "handkerchief linen from Arab bazaar" for on-site work
- **Paint Application:** Commercial tube oil colors from Roberson colorman applied into **wet flake-white oil paint ground** (not priming layer) using fine sable brushes (1-3mm width)
- **Binding Medium:** Amber varnish composed of **copal resin and drying oil** (Hunt's preferred medium for permanence, causes characteristic yellowing and embrittlement over time)
- **Brushwork Characteristics:** Invisible stroke absorption into smooth enamel-like surface; precise controlled application following form contours; no expressive deviation
- **Paint Thickness:** Thin transparent glazes over opaque white ground, 0.5-2mm total thickness, 2-5 color layers
- **Tool Arsenal:** Flexible palette knife, metal-ferruled flat brushes (Victorian-era innovations), fine detail sables
- **Drying Characteristics:** Extended cure time from copal medium, occasional drying wrinkles in thick passages

**Thematic Purpose:**

- **Religious Mission:** Bringing biblical narratives to life through archaeological accuracy and psychological realism, stripping away classical idealization to reveal human spiritual struggle
- **Moral Instruction:** Victorian domestic scenes as cautionary tales or moral awakenings, every object symbolically loaded to guide viewer interpretation
- **Pastoral Idealization:** Working-class romantic escape with naturalistic botanical precision, celebrating English countryside beauty
- **Portrait Psychology:** Capturing individual character through microscopic detail and ambiguous emotional restraint

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Wet-White-Ground Luminosity:** Universal consistency across all work - light reflecting from white substrate through transparent color layers creating internal glow quality; colors appear to emit light rather than merely reflect it with pure hue saturation at 85-95%; darker passages maintain translucency with light penetrating and reflecting back; overall illumination 120-150% brighter than photographic naturalism
2. **Microscopic Detail Density:** Foreground elements must achieve detail saturation where botanical specimens show individual leaf vein networks (primary, secondary, tertiary veins distinguishable), fabric weave shows warp/weft thread intersections, wood grain displays growth ring striations and tool mark impressions, architectural carving shows chisel marks and surface texture; middleground elements at 10-20 feet maintain near-foreground precision; background elements preserve sharp focus contradicting atmospheric perspective expectations
3. **Symbolic Object Loading:** Multiple props per composition with every element morally/theologically/narratively significant - designed for prolonged intellectual "reading" rather than immediate visual consumption
4. **Anti-Idealized Anatomical Realism:** Minimal deviation from photographic human proportions, individual model features preserved; facial rendering includes visible skin pores, individual facial hair strands distinguishable, skin texture variations, at least 2-3 facial asymmetries (uneven eyebrows, ear size variation, nose deviation, jawline asymmetry); exposed flesh shows visible vein networks, tendon/sinew definition, individual body hair strands; hands sometimes enlarged for narrative emphasis with individual finger joints, nail beds, knuckle wrinkles, palm creases rendered microscopically
5. **Psychological Ambiguity:** Facial expressions conveying complex emotional states (awakening/realization/spiritual crisis/moral tension/ecstasy/surrender/doubt) rather than simple emotions; varied gaze direction balancing direct viewer address with internal scene focus

**Period Framing:** 1848-1870s Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood revolutionary movement through Hunt's major exhibition period; Victorian England with Middle Eastern research travel for religious subject authenticity; rebellion against Royal Academy establishment and High Renaissance idealization

**Tone Tag:** Obsessive naturalistic precision, psychological complexity, moral seriousness, spiritual intensity, anti-academic rebellion, microscopic "truth to nature" commitment, luminous color with internal glow quality, symbolic density, claustrophobic detail saturation

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**1. Wet-White-Ground Luminosity Anchor (Defining Technical Signature):**

- **Method:** Apply transparent oil colors directly into wet flake-white oil paint ground (not dry priming layer)
- **Effect:** Light reflects from white substrate through transparent color layers creating characteristic luminous quality
- **Intensity Measurement:** 120-150% heightened beyond photographic naturalism - highlights 20-50% brighter, mid-tones 15-30% brighter, shadows 10-20% brighter than camera exposure would capture
- **Consistency:** Universal application across all compositions - Pre-Raphaelite technical identifier
- **Surface Quality:** Paint surface exhibits reflective sheen characteristic of multiple thin glaze layers; zero visible brushstroke texture - surface appears continuous without directional marks; light reflection from surface is specular (mirror-like) not diffuse (matte); canvas weave texture suppressed to near-invisibility; surface reads as polished rather than textured when viewed at oblique angles
- **Color Transparency:** Alizarin crimson, ultramarine blue, viridian green applied as thin glazes (0.3-0.8mm thickness) over opaque white for maximum luminosity
- **Aging Artifacts:** 10-20% warm yellow shift in white areas from copal varnish deterioration; adulterated orange vermilion darkening to brown-black from red lead contamination

**2. Microscopic Detail Precision Anchor:**

**Botanical Detail Standard:**

- Leaf vein networks: Primary, secondary, and tertiary veins distinguishable
- Leaf margins: Serration patterns or smooth edges rendered accurately for species
- Petal structure: Individual petal overlap visible, surface texture (smooth/papery/velvety) differentiated
- Stem characteristics: Node positions, leaf attachment points, surface texture (smooth/hairy/ridged) present

**Textile Detail Standard:**

- Fabric weave: Warp and weft thread intersections visible at close inspection
- Thread count: Individual threads distinguishable in plain weave fabrics
- Pattern precision: Decorative motifs (paisley, florals, geometric) maintain exact repeat accuracy
- Dimensional texture: Pile fabrics (velvet) show individual fiber directionality; embroidery threads show raised dimensional presence

**Wood Detail Standard:**

- Grain patterns: Growth ring striations following wood species characteristics
- Tool marks: Plane marks, saw cuts, chisel facets visible where appropriate
- Surface aging: Wear patterns, color variation from handling/exposure rendered
- Joint construction: Mortise-tenon joints, dovetails, nails/pegs visible where carpentry exposed

**PROHIBITED DETAIL FAILURES:**

- ❌ Fabric rendered as solid color fields without weave structure
- ❌ Hair rendered as smooth masses without individual strand separation
- ❌ Skin rendered as airbrushed/smoothed surfaces without pore texture
- ❌ Embroidery suggested through color variation rather than thread-by-thread rendering
- ❌ Wood grain implied through tonal variation rather than linear striations
- ❌ Background elements softened through atmospheric blur rather than maintaining sharp focus

**3. Anti-Idealized Anatomical Realism Anchor:**

**REQUIRED IMPERFECTION MARKERS:**

- At least 2-3 facial asymmetries: uneven eyebrows, ear size variation, nose deviation, jawline asymmetry
- Visible skin texture at 100% zoom: pore visibility, fine wrinkles, surface irregularities
- Non-uniform skin tone: flushed cheeks, blue undertones in temples, warmth variations
- Individual eyelash separation: no mascara-clumped effect, sparse areas acceptable
- Beard/eyebrow individual hair directionality: not uniform combed appearance

**Facial Rendering Requirements:**

- Visible pores at close inspection distance
- Individual facial hair strands (beard, eyebrow, eyelash) distinguishable
- Skin texture variations in facial close-ups
- Facial asymmetries preserved from model reference

**Exposed Flesh Requirements:**

- Visible veins, sinew, tendon definition
- Body hair individual strands where anatomically present
- Sweat droplets, moisture effects (particularly religious subjects)
- Muscle striations in exposed flesh

**Hand Treatment:**

- Hands sometimes enlarged for narrative gesture importance
- Individual finger joints, nail beds, knuckle wrinkles, palm creases rendered microscopically

**Skin Tone Naturalism:**

- Non-idealized flesh tones with visible color variations (flushed cheeks, blue vein undertones, sun-weathered tanning, shadow warmth)
- Middle Eastern subjects rendered with bronzed authenticity rejecting European idealization

**PROHIBITED IDEALIZATION MARKERS:**

- ❌ Porcelain-smooth skin without visible texture
- ❌ Perfectly symmetric facial features
- ❌ Uniform skin tone without color variation
- ❌ Clumped/painted hair without strand separation
- ❌ Classical nose profiles (straight bridges, refined tips)

**4. Jewel-Tone Color Saturation Anchor:**

- **Palette Intensity:** Deep crimsons (#8B1A1A, #DC143C), forest greens (#228B22, #2E8B57), royal blues (#191970, #4169E1), goldenrod (#DAA520, #B8860B) at maximum intensity
- **Color Mixing Method:** Minimal palette mixing preserving individual pigment intensity - layered transparent glazes rather than pre-mixed opacity
- **Shadow Treatment:** Transparent colorful shadows maintaining luminosity in shadow areas - never dead black; shadow colors complement/contrast base hues creating vibrant darkness
- **Highlight Precision:** Sharp reflective highlights on eyes (corneal catchlights), metal surfaces, water, polished wood, jewelry - pure white or pale tints at maximum value
- **Aging Consideration:** Account for yellow shift from copal varnish deterioration in color relationships (original blues appear slightly green-shifted, whites appear cream)

**5. Pose Psychological Complexity Anchor:**

- **Religious Pose Patterns:** Devotional prayer hands (clasped, raised, reaching) with head tilt variations; cruciform arm extensions with psychological ambiguity (surrender/ecstasy/agony); body angles creating tension
- **Domestic Pose Patterns:** Psychological awakening gestures (hand to chest, sudden rising, defensive positioning); body rotation suggesting interrupted action; mirror-gazing reflection with complex layered perspectives
- **Pastoral Pose Patterns:** Reclining intimacy at various angles to ground plane; chaste physical proximity (hands touching, embracing, leaning); working-class postures (bent backs, rolled sleeves, often barefoot)
- **Portrait Pose Patterns:** Frontal confrontation with direct viewer gaze; three-quarter seated positioning; hands prominently displayed with specific gestures (holding symbolic objects, relaxed formal placement)
- **Gesture Economy:** Significant hand gestures carrying narrative weight; eye direction split between direct viewer address and internal scene focus
- **Expression Restraint:** Ambiguous emotional complexity over simple emotions - faces convey multiple simultaneous states (doubt/faith, awakening/confusion, intimacy/reservation, solemnity/ecstasy)

**6. Hard-Edge Precision Anchor:**

- **Contour Definition:** Sharp precise boundaries predominate - minimal atmospheric blending except intentional distance effects
- **Figure Separation:** Clear silhouette distinction between figures and backgrounds through contour precision rather than value contrast alone
- **Object Boundaries:** Microscopic edge rendering on props, architectural elements, botanical specimens maintaining sharpness contradicting soft-focus expectations
- **Brushwork Invisibility:** Stroke marks absorbed into smooth surface through controlled wet-into-wet technique; no visible impasto, no expressionist gesture evidence; zero visible brushstroke texture creating continuous surface
- **Line Quality:** Implicit rather than explicit - edges created through color/value adjacency with razor precision rather than drawn contour lines

**7. Heightened Naturalistic Lighting Anchor:**

- **Source Logic:** Single-point naturalistic sources - harsh desert sunlight (religious exteriors), window daylight flooding (domestic interiors), dappled tree-canopy light (pastoral), specific side-lighting (portraits described in Section 7)
- **Intensity Amplification:** Brightness heightened beyond photographic naturalism - spiritual/dramatic illumination effect at 120-150% camera exposure
- **Cast Shadow Precision:** Architecturally accurate shadow geometry following light physics; varying edge qualities appropriate to light source and distance
- **Backlighting Effects:** Silhouette halos, atmospheric haze through curtains, rim-lighting on hair/fabric edges where appropriate
- **Time-of-Day Markers:** Midday to late afternoon golden hour bias in pastoral scenes; variable interior lighting with identifiable window direction; harsh noon sun in Middle Eastern religious exteriors

**8. Material Aging Authenticity Anchor:**

- **Copal Varnish Yellowing:** Warm yellow-amber shift in all white/light areas as authentic aging characteristic (not defect)
- **Vermilion Darkening:** Adulterated orange vermilion (red lead contamination) shifts to brown-black in aged passages - documented historical pigment failure
- **Surface Characteristics:** Minimal cracking due to thin paint application; occasional drying wrinkles in thicker passages; overall smooth finish maintained
- **Canvas Texture Suppression:** Smooth ground preparation minimizes visible weave - most surface appears panel-like rather than textile-textured
- **Period-Appropriate Imperfections:** Accept/incorporate documented material failures as authenticating features rather than modern perfection

**9. Fabric Material Physics Anchor (Victorian Portrait Mode):**

**Velvet Rendering Requirements:**

- Individual pile fiber directionality visible at close inspection
- Pile depth 2-3mm creating light absorption in folds vs. reflection on raised surfaces
- Nap direction showing stroke patterns from historical wear/pressing

- **Silk:** High sheen with directional light reflection; crisp folds with sharp creases; thin drape conforming to body contours
- **Velvet:** Deep pile texture absorbing light in folds, reflecting on raised surfaces; heavy drape with rounded fold forms
- **Linen/Cotton:** Matte finish; crisp angular folds with visible weave texture; wrinkle patterns from wear
- **Wool:** Matte to slight sheen; soft rounded folds; visible nap texture in close inspection
- **Lace:** Transparent overlay with microscopic hole patterns; stiff structure maintaining shape; shadow casting through openwork
- **Period Accuracy:** 1840s-1870s construction methods - hand-stitching visible in close inspection, natural fiber characteristics, period-appropriate fasteners (hooks, buttons, ties)

**WARDROBE VARIATION REQUIREMENT:**

- **Color Cycling:** Change primary garment colors between iterations avoiding identical repetition
- **Pattern Variation:** Rotate between solid fabrics, stripes, paisleys, brocades, embroidered elements
- **Accessory Diversity:** Select different symbolic props from YAML pools maintaining genre coherence
- **Period Palette Constraint:** All colors must be achievable with 1840s-1870s natural and early synthetic dyes

**PROP RENDERING REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Material Authenticity:** Wood grain, metal patina, ceramic glazing, textile weave all microscopically precise
- **Symbolic Loading:** Every prop carries narrative/moral/theological significance - avoid purely decorative selection
- **Period Accuracy:** Objects authentic to 1840s-1870s or biblical/historical setting; no anachronisms
- **Detail Hierarchy:** Hero prop receives maximum detail attention; micro prop rendered with equal precision but smaller scale
- **Cultural Authenticity:** Middle Eastern objects for religious scenes; Victorian manufactured goods for domestic scenes; agricultural implements for pastoral scenes; professional tools for portraits

**COHERENCE FILTER:**

- All wardrobe and props must support declared genre and historical period
- Symbolic significance takes precedence over decorative appeal
- If prop selection becomes incoherent or anachronistic, fallback = clean scene with reduced prop count
- Maximum 2 props total per figure maintains Hunt's compositional focus on figure psychology and environment over object proliferation

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

**For Landscape Ratios (4:3, 5:4):**

- **Religious Narrative (4:3):** Horizontal narrative flow with multiple figure arrangement; figures occupy canvas width with spatial compression creating shallow relief-like arrangement (figures in near-plane clustering with minimal depth recession); sharp distant detail resisting atmospheric softening
- **Pastoral Romantic (5:4):** Gentle horizontal expansion accommodating flock animals and botanical foreground density; figures occupy foreground with extended horizon line, possible sheep middleground, sharp distant landscape detail; dappled tree-canopy light with golden hour bias

**For Portrait Ratios (3:4, 4:5):**

- **Domestic Moral Narrative (3:4):** Vertical compression creating psychological claustrophobia; figure height dominance with tight interior framing; ornamental Victorian surface density filling all available space; mirror/window devices showing alternate perspectives in many compositions
- **Portrait (3:4):** Vertical emphasis with strong subject dominance; minimal background (atmospheric void or single architectural element); tight three-quarter or half-length crop; direct confrontational framing with psychological intensity

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**Religious Narrative Composition:**

- **Perspective Regime:** Compressed shallow relief arrangement with figures in near-plane clustering; minimal depth recession contradicting conventional linear perspective
- **Figure:Ground:** Figure/architectural dominance with remaining symbolic environment
- **Density:** Maximum foreground detail, substantial middleground, background detail resisting atmospheric softening
- **Lighting Logic:** Harsh desert sunlight or single oil lamp creating sharp-edged architectural shadows; heightened spiritual illumination intensity
- **Symbolic Layering:** Multiple props with theological significance; hidden narratives in background scenes, architectural details, costume elements
- **Archaeological Accuracy:** Palestinian architecture (stone walls, carved wooden screens, textile hangings); Dead Sea landscapes with geological precision; period-accurate vessels, tools, costume based on research travel

**Domestic Moral Narrative Composition:**

- **Perspective Regime:** Tight interior compression with Victorian ornamental density; every surface (walls, floors, furniture, ceiling) detailed to maximum capacity
- **Figure:Ground:** Figure dominance with highly detailed environment
- **Density:** Maximum everywhere - all compositional zones saturated; psychological claustrophobia through detail saturation
- **Lighting Logic:** Window daylight flooding interior creating backlighting effects, silhouette halos, atmospheric haze through curtains; heightened realism
- **Mirror/Window Devices:** Many compositions include reflective surfaces showing alternate perspectives, hidden narratives, symbolic secondary scenes
- **Victorian Authenticity:** Period-accurate furniture construction (every nail, joint, carved detail rendered); wallpaper patterns microscopically precise; gilt frame ornament detail; textile pattern repeats on upholstery, carpets, curtains

**Pastoral Romantic Composition:**

- **Perspective Regime:** Extended atmospheric depth with visible horizon lines; conventional linear perspective with sharp distant focus contradicting normal aerial perspective softening
- **Figure:Ground:** Balanced figures and landscape with botanical precision
- **Density:** Maximum foreground botanical detail (individual grass blades, wildflower species, leaf structures), substantial middleground (sheep wool texture if present, tree bark detail), maintained background sharpness (distant landscape detail)
- **Lighting Logic:** Natural sunlight with dappled tree-canopy effects; golden hour late afternoon bias; heightened natural illumination
- **Animal Presence:** Sheep flocks with individual wool texture and facial features appropriate to pastoral context; cattle, goats rendered with species precision
- **Botanical Fidelity:** Species-specific wildflowers, grasses, trees allowing botanical identification from rendering accuracy; "minute, botanical fidelity" as compositional priority

**Portrait Composition:**

- **Perspective Regime:** Minimal depth - atmospheric void backgrounds or single architectural fragment suggestions
- **Figure:Ground:** Strong figure dominance with minimal dark atmospheric background
- **Density:** Maximum facial detail rendering (every pore, hair, eyelash); rich fabric texture microscopic precision; minimal prop detail but equally precise
- **Lighting Logic - Single Point Side Illumination:** Light source positioned 45-60° to subject's left or right, 15-30° above eye level; one side of face receives full illumination, opposite side transitions through mid-tone to shadow; illuminated cheek on shadow-side creates characteristic triangular highlight beneath eye (formed by nose shadow boundary meeting cheek illumination); light-to-shadow transition occurs gradually across face width not as abrupt edge; shadow areas maintain luminosity never dead black - transparent colorful darkness with warm undertones; single sharp highlight reflection in each eye positioned at 10-11 o'clock (left light) or 1-2 o'clock (right light); light source creates subtle graduated illumination on background from light-source side fading to deep shadow on opposite side
- **Framing Tightness:** Three-quarter length or half-length crops; direct confrontational positioning with minimal head rotation
- **Background Treatment:** Forest green (#1a3a1a to #0d1f0d), umber (#3a2a1a to #1f150d), or near-black atmospheric voids with subtle tonal variation suggesting spatial depth through colorful transparent darkness; warm undertones from copal varnish aging creating slight yellow-amber shift with olive-tinged depths; very subtle tonal variations (2-5% value fluctuations) preventing flat color-field appearance; OR single architectural element (column capital, wall corner edge, door frame) rendered with full foreground detail precision receiving same lighting as figure

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:**

- Religious: Palestinian stone architecture, plastered walls, carved wooden screens, textile hangings; Dead Sea desolate landscapes
- Domestic: Victorian interior walls (patterned wallpaper, wainscoting, picture rails); polished wood floors or patterned carpets
- Pastoral: English countryside grass, wildflower meadows, wheat fields, tree canopies; natural earth and vegetation
- Portrait: Atmospheric void or minimal architectural suggestion; studio-controlled non-specific environment

**Frame/Band Anchor:**

- **OMIT ENTIRELY** - Pre-Raphaelite paintings do not feature integrated decorative frames within picture plane
- Hunt's work exhibited in external gallery frames only; internal composition extends to canvas edge without borders

**Production Context Anchor:**

- Oil on fine linen canvas (120-180 threads per inch) with smooth white ground preparation
- Wet-white-ground technique application visible through luminous transparency
- Copal varnish medium aging artifacts (10-20% yellow shift, vermilion darkening)
- Period 1840s-1870s production methods authentic to Pre-Raphaelite technical innovations

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:**

- Composition designed specifically for declared aspect ratio (4:3 landscape religious, 5:4 landscape pastoral, 3:4 portrait domestic/portrait)
- All spatial allocations, figure placements, environmental extensions optimized for chosen format
- No evidence of adaptation from different source ratio - native composition for target format

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** OMIT

**Justification:** William Holman Hunt's Pre-Raphaelite canvases do not integrate typography. Narrative meaning emerges through symbolic props, botanical specificity, and psychological gesture. Any legible text (book spines, sheet music) appears only as environmental detail, not as typographic design.

**Format Guidance:** Keep the painted surface entirely pictorial. If curatorial context requires text, supply it via external plaques, captions, or catalogue entries—the canvas remains text-free.
