# John William Waterhouse - Pre-Raphaelite / Academic Classicism Framework

**Timeframe:** 1880s-1917
 **Historical Context:** British Pre-Raphaelite painter working in the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, known for romantic interpretations of literary and mythological subjects. Combined Academic painting technique with Pre-Raphaelite narrative sensibility and color palette. Works characterized by melancholic heroines from classical mythology, Arthurian legend, and Victorian poetry (Tennyson, Keats). Painted in traditional oil on canvas using extensive glazing techniques for luminous skin tones and atmospheric effects.

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement Protocol:** Aspect ratio control is prompt-based only. Combat model's resistance to ratio instructions through explicit ratio declaration in multiple prompt locations, repetitive ratio reinforcement, negative constraints prohibiting unwanted ratios, and compositional anchors designed specifically for target ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette, gesture, expression, and Waterhouse's characteristic melancholic introspection.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("110-120% neck elongation", "1-3mm paint thickness", "3-7 glazing layers") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Classical oil glazing technique supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean` (extensive glazing for luminous skin)
- **Pose Flags:** `contrapposto`, `contemplative-seated`, `gestural-fluid`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` or `source-respect`
- **Material Physics Authority:** Traditional oil painting on canvas with earth-tone grounds
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Gallery viewing distance (6-10 feet) informs brushwork precision
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity; no real logos/watermarks/signatures
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** All figures fully clothed in period-appropriate classical or medieval garments; ankle-length minimum coverage for adults, knee-to-ankle for youth
- **Gender expression:** **CRITICAL - Respect presented gender.** Masculine subjects = masculine wardrobe track (togas, tunics, armor). Feminine subjects = feminine wardrobe track (chitons, gowns, draped garments). Match styling to presented gender in source or user specification.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters or modern post-processing; authentic oil painting surface characteristics required
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; no artificial borders or watermarks
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid generic Pre-Raphaelite drift, anime contamination, HDR smoothing
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail
- **STRICT TERMINATION:** Framework ends at Section 8. DO NOT add commentary or content beyond Section 8.

------

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- **RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **3:4**. This is a hard requirement.
- Redraw in **John William Waterhouse Pre-Raphaelite Academic Classicism** for **museum gallery oil painting on canvas**.
- Identity via silhouette, gesture, melancholic expression, and romantic narrative context.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original mythological/literary character designs avoiding copyrighted elements; classical and medieval subjects in public domain.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean` with extensive glazing for skin luminosity
- **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto` or `contemplative-seated` depending on narrative context
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend`
- **Safety Mandate:** All figures fully clothed in period-appropriate garments with ankle-length minimum coverage, modest necklines.
- **Style Dominance:** Oil painting technique with 3-7 thin glazing layers for skin, soft diffused natural lighting from upper left 45°, melancholic introspective expression, earth tone backgrounds with jewel tone accent fabrics, elongated necks (110-120% proportion), slightly enlarged eyes (105-110%), romantic literary/mythological narrative. **CRITICAL: Respect presented gender - masculine subjects receive masculine styling and wardrobe; feminine subjects receive feminine styling and wardrobe.**
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery
- **Final Ratio Confirmation:** Output must be exactly **3:4 ratio**, no exceptions.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**RATIO SELECTION:** `3:4` (portrait - 864×1184) - Native NanoBanana support, no adaptation required

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Ratio Status:** Native 3:4 portrait format
- **Reframing Method:** Extend atmospheric background to fill vertical portrait composition
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure occupies 60-75% of canvas height, head placement in upper third, groundline in lower 15-25%
- **Background Treatment:** Atmospheric perspective with 3-5 distinct spatial planes; natural settings (forest/water) extend seamlessly to canvas edges; interior settings show classical architecture with measured linear perspective
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 portrait ratio serves Waterhouse's single-figure narrative compositions, vertical emphasis suits standing/seated contemplative poses, allows environmental context while maintaining figure dominance

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood color palette and literary subjects; Academic Classicism painting technique; Victorian Romantic sensibility; Classical mythology and Arthurian legend; Tennyson and Keats poetry visualization

**Medium/Production Method:** Oil on canvas using traditional fat-over-lean technique. Canvas preparation with earth-tone ground (burnt sienna/raw umber) showing through in 60% of final surface. Extensive glazing (3-7 thin layers) for skin luminosity and fabric transparency. Wet blending for atmospheric effects. Brush-loaded single strokes for foliage suggestion. Paint thickness 1-3mm average, 5mm maximum in highlights. Varnish creates period-authentic high gloss finish.

**Thematic Purpose:** Romantic visualization of literary and mythological narratives emphasizing melancholic introspection, feminine contemplation, and poetic longing. Subjects typically represent moments of emotional complexity from classical mythology (Psyche, Pandora, nymphs), Arthurian legend (Lady of Shalott, Guinevere), or Victorian poetry (Ophelia, La Belle Dame).

**Hallmark Motifs with Quantified Specifications:**

1. **Neck Elongation:** 110-120% standard proportion creating graceful vertical emphasis with 5-10° forward tilt
2. **Melancholic Expression:** Downward gaze option, 8-15° head tilt, relaxed facial muscles with slight frown, creating introspective psychological depth
3. **Atmospheric Water Environments:** Deep blue-green water tones (#1C4966, #2F5F7F) with visible depth layering and wet stone reflections
4. **Auburn Hair Option:** Warm reddish-brown tones (#8B4513, #A0522D) with naturalistic flow and individual strand suggestion, or dark hair (#3C2415, #4A3728)
5. **Classical Drapery Physics:** Fabric behavior follows gravitational logic with pipe folds, diaper folds, spiral twists, half-lock, and cascade variations; glazing creates transparency in 2-4 layers

**Period Framing:** Late Victorian/Edwardian Academic painting (1880s-1917), exhibited at Royal Academy, collected by industrial magnates, bridging Pre-Raphaelite romanticism with academic technical mastery

**Tone Tag:** Melancholic, romantic, introspective, narrative-driven, literary

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Painting Technique Anchors:**

1. **Glazing Layering Method:** 3-7 thin transparent oil layers for skin rendering, building from earth-tone underpainting through warm peachy tones (#F5DEB3, #E8C5A5) to final luminosity. Each layer 0.3-0.5mm thickness, allowing ground color to contribute to overall warmth. Shadow areas receive cool blue-violet glazes for temperature contrast.
2. **Brushwork Visibility Hierarchy:** Face rendering with minimal stroke visibility - highly blended wet-on-wet technique with lost-and-found edges. Fabric rendering shows moderate stroke visibility following drape structure, directional application visible in fold valleys. Background execution variable - visible brushwork in foliage suggestion, atmospheric blending in sky/water recession.
3. **Lighting Logic - Diffused Natural Source:** Primary light from upper left 45° angle option, creating soft shadow edges with 5-10mm gradient transitions at form boundaries. Shadow density transparent - detail remains visible in shadow areas. Highlight placement selective on facial features, fabric peaks, metallic objects; intensity controlled at 85-95% value, rarely pure white. Chromatic shift: warm highlights on skin, cool highlights on fabric.
4. **Atmospheric Perspective Treatment:** Background saturation 50-70% vs foreground saturation 70-85%. Color shift warm-to-cool with distance. Value shift 20-30% lighter in far background. Edge treatment: sharp foreground detail, progressively softer recession through 3-5 distinct spatial planes with 15-25% canvas depth transition zone.
5. **Fabric Transparency Rendering:** 2-4 glazes for sheer materials, mixing body tone color + fabric color to create visible composite. Gauze/silk transparency shows anatomical forms through maximum 2 layers. Edge treatment soft at transparent boundaries. Compression points clearly defined at waist, shoulder, elbow with tension lines visible as subtle value shifts.

**Pose Anchors:**

- **Contrapposto Standing:** Weight on one leg, 15-25° hip angle shift, shoulders counter-rotated 10-20°, creating elegant S-curve through torso
- **Contemplative Seated:** Relaxed torso rotation 10-20°, head tilt 8-15° average, hands deliberately positioned touching objects (lyres, vessels, flowers)
- **Head Position:** Varied gaze directions including downward contemplative, profile view, or direct gaze; contributes to introspective melancholic quality

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Neck elongation 110-120% standard proportion, eyes slightly enlarged 105-110%, hands naturalistic 95-100% with fingers elongated 100-105%. All other proportions naturalistic within visible frame. Paint thickness measured: 1-3mm average, 5mm maximum in impasto highlights.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Traditional oil painting surface characteristics required - canvas weave texture subtle, varnish creates period-authentic high gloss finish, no digital smoothing or modern post-processing effects. Underpainting visible through glaze layers in portions of surface.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All technical methods authentic to 1880s-1917 Academic oil painting practice - fat-over-lean layering, natural hair brushes, traditional pigments, linen canvas preparation with earth-tone grounds.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 3:4 portrait ratio with figure occupying 60-75% canvas height, head in upper third, environmental context in remaining 25-40% with purposeful negative space allocation.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks - SAFETY CALIBRATED FOR NO NUDITY:**

**CRITICAL: Gender Expression Respect - Match wardrobe track to presented gender in source image or user specification.**

**Adult Feminine:**

- **Classical Greek:** Full-length chiton (ankle-length minimum) in white linen (#F5F5DC, #EEE8DC) or jewel-tone silk (deep red #8B3A3A, blue #4682B4, green #556B2F). Peplos with shoulder pinning, proper draping creating pipe folds and diaper compression. Fabric behavior: linen shows crisp folds with sharp highlights, silk shows fluid drape with high sheen.
- **Medieval/Arthurian:** Floor-length gowns in rich fabrics - burgundy wool (#8B3A3A), forest green (#556B2F), deep blue (#4682B4). Long sleeves, modest necklines, fitted bodices with flowing skirts. Fabric weight creates heavy drape with soft folds.
- **Romantic/Poetic:** Layered gauze and silk combinations maintaining full opacity through multiple layers. Flowing sleeves, draped sashes, ankle-length hemlines. Strategic use of hair as additional coverage element while maintaining naturalistic flow.

**Adult Masculine:**

- **Classical Greek/Roman:** Full-length toga or himation (ankle-length) in white linen or deep earth tones. Draped over one shoulder leaving other arm free. Tunic beneath with proper draping. For warriors: tunic with leather cuirass, greaves, classical helmet.
- **Medieval/Arthurian:** Knee-length to floor-length tunics in deep colors (burgundy #8B3A3A, forest green #556B2F, midnight blue #4682B4). Fitted at shoulders, belted at waist. Long cloaks draped over shoulders. For knights: period-accurate armor over tunic, surcoat, chainmail visible.
- **Romantic/Poetic:** Loose linen shirts (white, cream) with open collars, dark breeches or trousers, long cloaks or robes in rich fabrics. Boots or barefoot depending on setting.

**Youth (Any Gender):**

- Simple tunic or chiton in light colors, knee to ankle length depending on activity
- Modest coverage appropriate to age and historical context
- Natural, age-appropriate styling

**Fabric Behavior Physics:**

- **Linen:** Crisp folds, matte finish, sharp highlight edges, holds form
- **Silk:** Fluid drape, complex fold patterns, high sheen with cool highlights, follows curves
- **Wool:** Heavy drape, soft rounded folds, matte to slight sheen, substantial weight
- **Gauze:** Transparent when single layer, opaque when doubled, delicate structure, minimal weight

**Accessory Caps:** Elaborate 3-4 items maximum

- **Belts:** Cord, jeweled, or metal at natural waist - defines compression point for drapery
- **Headwear:** Floral wreaths (roses, laurel), jeweled headbands, veils (transparent but decorative)
- **Jewelry:** Minimal to moderate - simple bracelets, necklaces, earrings in gold or bronze
- **Footwear:** Barefoot or simple sandals

**Color Palette Restrictions:** Earth tone backgrounds (#8B7355, #A0826D, #6B5D4F) with jewel tone fabric accents. Desaturated color approach - avoid pure saturated primaries. Skin tones warm peachy (#F5DEB3, #E8C5A5). Auburn hair dominance (#8B4513, #A0522D) 75% frequency.

**Wardrobe Variation Required:** Change primary garment colors/styles between iterations - cycle through white linen, deep red silk, forest green wool, deep blue classical draping. Avoid identical color repetition.

**Props:** 1 hero + optional 1 micro (total ≤2)

**Hero Props (choose 1):**

```yaml
mythological_vessels:
  - amphora (bronze/ceramic with decorative patterns)
  - krater (wide-mouth mixing vessel, gold/bronze)
  - hydria (water vessel with three handles)
  - chalice (ritual cup, metallic sheen)

musical_instruments:
  - lyre (precise string detail, wood and metal construction)
  - harp (larger scale, multiple strings visible)
  - pan pipes (reed construction, held to lips)

literary_objects:
  - mirror (polished metal, hand-held, reflective surface suggested)
  - book/scroll (medieval or classical manuscript)
  - sword (Arthurian context, historically accurate to period)

natural_elements:
  - flower_bouquet (roses, lilies, wildflowers - botanically accurate)
  - laurel_wreath (individual leaf detail, classical symbolism)
  - single_dramatic_flower (oversized rose or lily as narrative focus)
```

**Micro Props (optional, choose 0-1):**

```yaml
scattered_elements:
  - petals_on_ground (roses, lilies - 5-10 individual petals)
  - small_stones (river rocks, textured surfaces)
  - water_plants (reeds, lily pads at water's edge)
  - jewelry_detail (single bracelet, small earrings)
```

**Coherence Filter:** All elements support Pre-Raphaelite romantic narrative with classical/medieval historical accuracy. If props don't serve literary/mythological storytelling, default to clean scene with environmental elements only (flowers, stones, water, foliage).

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (3:4 Portrait Format):**

- Vertical emphasis with figure dominance ≥60% canvas height
- Head placement in upper third (25-35% from top edge)
- Hierarchical staging: foreground figure detail, midground environmental context, background atmospheric recession
- Groundline at 75-85% canvas height, allowing 15-25% for lower environmental detail
- Negative space 20-30% of composition in upper sky/atmospheric zone

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective Regime:** Classical linear perspective for interiors (columns, arches, tessellated floors with measured recession). Atmospheric perspective for natural settings (3-5 distinct spatial planes, warm-to-cool color shift, progressive edge softening).
- **Figure:Ground Ratio:** Figure 60-75% of canvas height in portrait orientation, environmental context 25-40%, creating narrative integration rather than isolated portraiture
- **Density Distribution:** Foreground high detail (individual leaves, flower petals, fabric fold precision), midground medium detail (mass and form definition), background low detail (atmospheric fade, soft edges), transition zone 15-25% of canvas depth
- **Lighting Logic:** Soft diffused natural light from upper left 45° (60% frequency), creating transparent shadows with detail visible, highlight placement selective on facial features and fabric peaks, chromatic shift warm on skin/cool on fabric
- **Detail:Negative Space Ratio:** 70% detailed narrative elements, 30% atmospheric negative space for compositional breathing room and melancholic mood

**ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:**

**Natural Settings (preferred for 3:4 portrait):**

- **Forest:** Deep atmospheric perspective with dappled light through canopy, individual foreground leaves/flowers visible, mass definition in midground trees, soft atmospheric fade in background, earth tone dominance (#6B5D4F, #4A3C2E) with green accents (#556B2F, #6B8E23)
- **Waterscape:** Rivers, ponds, or sea with visible depth layering, foreground wet stones with highlight reflections, midground water surface with gentle ripples, background atmospheric horizon, deep blue-green tones (#1C4966, #2F5F7F, #4682B4)
- **Garden:** Cultivated flora with botanical accuracy (roses, lilies), classical architectural elements (urns, low walls, fountains), measured spatial recession, selective foreground flower detail with background atmospheric treatment

**Interior Settings:**

- **Classical Architecture:** Doric/Ionic/Corinthian columns with capital detail, rounded or Gothic arches, tessellated floor patterns with precise linear perspective, natural light from window openings creating soft ambient glow
- **Furnishings:** Period-accurate couches, chairs, tables with appropriate construction, fabric draping on furniture following same physics as garments
- **Windows:** Gothic or Romanesque arched openings showing landscape beyond, creating depth and light source justification

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Oil painting on linen canvas with earth-tone ground showing through glaze layers
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT ENTIRELY - no decorative frames, borders, or bands (violates Waterhouse academic painting convention)
- **Production Context Anchor:** Traditional Academic oil painting technique authentic to 1880s-1917 British gallery exhibition standard
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for 3:4 portrait ratio - vertical emphasis suits standing/seated contemplative figures with environmental narrative context, head in upper third, groundline in lower quarter, atmospheric background fills remaining vertical space

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** OMIT

John William Waterhouse's Academic paintings contained no typography or text elements. All narrative content communicated through visual imagery, pose, expression, and environmental symbolism. Museum gallery presentation practice requires a clean canvas with no text, titles, or captions.

**Historical Accuracy:** Period exhibitions presented titles on separate wall plaques or catalogue entries rather than within the painted surface. Maintain that standard—paint only the image.
