# Edward Runci Hollywood Glamour Pin-Up Style

**Version:** 1.0
 **Artist:** Edward Runci (1921-1986)
 **Genre:** 1940s-1950s American Commercial Pin-Up Art - Hollywood Glamour Subgenre
 **Purpose:** Authentic replication of post-WWII advertising glamour aesthetic with period-accurate materiality and commercial reproduction characteristics

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Likeness Preservation Priority:** Maintain source model's core identifying features (hair color, eye color, facial structure, complexion tone) while applying Runci's stylistic idealization techniques; style enhances rather than replaces identity
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("130-140% eye enlargement", "15-35° head tilt", "70-80% figure dominance") override descriptive language
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Oil painting technique followed by halftone reproduction process supersedes digital rendering
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** `hollywood-glamour-idealization`, `post-war-aspirational-beauty`, `commercial-calendar-aesthetic`
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Embrace period-specific beauty idealization and commercial glamour conventions
- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**
  - *Runci Signature:* `airbrush-soft-glamour`, `oil-portrait-smooth`, `hollywood-lighting-sculpted`, `commercial-idealized`
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `glamour-portrait-stance`, `confident-engagement`, `aspirational-elegance`, `commercial-approachability`
- **Canvas Control Flags (choose one):** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`, `format-native`
- **Material Physics Authority:** Oil on canvas with commercial lithographic halftone reproduction specifications
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Viewing distance optimized for calendar/poster display (3-6 feet)
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** **No nudity**; bare shoulders and décolletage acceptable within 1950s advertising standards; no copyrighted brand logos or product designs; create original beverage bottle designs if props required
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Adult female subjects (apparent age 20-28); modest glamour within commercial advertising standards
- **Gender expression:** Feminine glamour presentation consistent with post-war Hollywood aesthetic
- **Material authenticity:** Authentic oil painting surface characteristics followed by period halftone reproduction artifacts; no modern digital photo filters or Instagram effects
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1940s-1950s oil painting techniques with subsequent photomechanical lithographic reproduction for calendar/advertising distribution
- **Composition boundaries:** No decorative frames outside canvas; no artificial presentation borders, watermarks, or artist signatures (Runci signature if present should be subtle lower corner in paint)
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid sultry/mysterious expressions, overt sexuality, dark moody lighting, photographic realism, modern makeup trends, Instagram aesthetics
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail

------

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate
### 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely
- Redraw in **Edward Runci Hollywood Glamour Pin-Up style** for **1940s-1950s commercial calendar/advertising artwork**
- **Likeness Mandate:** Identity via source model's actual hair color, eye color, facial structure, and complexion preserved through Runci's idealization technique - style enhances features rather than replacing them with generic blonde/blue-eyed archetype
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original character design avoiding copyrighted costume elements, trademarked products, or identifiable celebrity likenesses; if beverage props included, create original bottle/label designs
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `airbrush-soft-glamour`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `glamour-portrait-stance`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** [select appropriate]
- **Style Dominance:** Post-war Hollywood glamour aesthetic (radiant joy, aspirational beauty, commercial approachability) overrides photographic realism or sultry pin-up conventions
- **Mode Selector:** Commercial calendar portrait

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control
### 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION (choose one exact specification):**

**PORTRAIT FORMATS:**

- `2:3` (standard commercial poster/calendar preferred)
- `3:4` (classical portrait alternate)
- `4:5` (modern poster adaptation)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Extend atmospheric background gradients to fill declared ratio while maintaining 70-80% figure dominance
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned in upper 60-70% of frame, slight off-center for dynamic balance
- **Background Treatment:** Soft atmospheric gradient wash extending seamlessly to canvas edges, no architectural detail
- **Format Justification:** [Ratio] provides optimal figure dominance for commercial glamour portrait presentation consistent with calendar/advertising format

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity
### 3) Artistic Style & Context

- **Influences:** Post-WWII Hollywood portrait photography (George Hurrell glamour lighting), 1940s film noir cinematography (strong directional lighting with soft fill), commercial advertising illustration standards (approachable aspirational beauty)
- **Medium/Production method:**
  - *Original:* Oil on canvas with soft-focus portrait technique, airbrush-smooth blending on facial features, visible brushwork in hair and fabric
  - *Reproduction:* Four-color (CMYK) halftone lithography at 150 lpi for calendar/poster distribution, smooth coated paper stock
- **Thematic purpose:** Commercial advertising glamour combining Hollywood sophistication with warm approachability; aspirational beauty standard for post-war consumer culture
- **3-5 hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**
  1. **Radiant confident smile** - open genuine expression showing upper teeth, Cupid's bow lip definition, no sultry or mysterious affect
  2. **Idealized facial construction** - eyes enlarged 130-140% of anatomical proportion, soft-focus skin rendering with airbrush-smooth transitions, 3-5 highlight planes (forehead, cheekbones, nose bridge, chin)
  3. **Volumetric hair styling** - hair mass 180-220% of natural skull volume, 3-5 tonal layers creating dimensional depth - **Applied to source model's actual hair color (brunette/black/auburn/blonde), NOT automatic blonde transformation**
  4. **Atmospheric gradient backgrounds** - soft vignette effect darker at edges, no architectural detail, color fields in deep reds, forest greens, navy blues, sky blues, soft pinks, or creams
  5. **Bare shoulder emphasis** - strapless, off-shoulder, or modest necklines with shoulder exposure, cleavage suggested not explicit, white/cream/pastel costume preference (8/13 images)
- **Period framing:** Post-WWII commercial glamour (1945-1955), Hollywood golden age aesthetic, American consumer optimism
- **Tone Tag:** Radiant, confident, approachable, aspirational, warm glamour
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Original oil paintings (1945-1960s) reproduced via photomechanical lithography for Shaw-Barton Calendar Company and corporate advertising clients (Coca-Cola era commercial art)

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making
### 4) Technical Execution (≥5 anchors + measurement specifications)

- **Facial rendering method:** Airbrush-smooth imperceptible tonal transitions on skin, no visible pore texture or brushstrokes on face, soft-focus glamour technique, specular highlights on nose tip, forehead center, cheekbones, chin point
- **Eye construction:** Enlarged 130-140% anatomical proportion, almond shape with pronounced upper lid crease, single bright catchlight upper-right placement typical, individual eyelash strokes 8-12 per eye, iris detail with radial pattern - **CRITICAL: Preserve source model's actual eye color (brown, hazel, green, blue) and apply Runci's enlargement/highlight technique to that natural color; do NOT default to generic light eyes**
- **Lip rendering:** Precise Cupid's bow definition, corners lifted in smile, upper teeth fully visible, lower teeth suggested, tonal gradation creating volume (3-4 values from highlight to shadow)
- **Hair rendering technique:** Visible brushstrokes in 3-5 tonal layers following form and volume, individual strand work on edges contrasting with mass tone interior, directional stroke work emphasizing hairstyle architecture (victory rolls, pin curls, waves) - **CRITICAL: Preserve source model's actual hair color (brunette, auburn, black, blonde) and apply Runci's volumetric technique to that natural color; do NOT default to platinum blonde unless source model is blonde**
- **Skin tone palette:** Base tone matches source model's natural complexion (pale, medium, olive, tan) adjusted to Runci's idealized peach-warm glow, rose-mauve shadow tones in recesses, cream-white highlights with subtle yellow, uniform idealized complexion eliminating blemishes/texture while preserving ethnic/individual skin tone characteristics
- **Background execution:** Loose atmospheric wash technique, pure color field with tonal gradation creating soft vignette (darker edges), minimal to zero architectural or environmental detail, 2-3 depth planes maximum (background wash, figure, occasional foreground prop)
- **Fabric rendering:** Simplified planes of light and shadow defining form, edge sharpness varies by material (crisp for satin, soft halo for fur), texture implied through tonal variation not surface detail, specular highlights for satin/silk, soft diffusion for fur/cotton
- **Lighting architecture:** Upper-left 45-degree key light creating dimensional form shadows, soft ambient fill eliminating harsh contrasts, occasional rim light on hair/shoulders for separation from background
- **Pose Anchors:**
  - Head tilt 15-35° from vertical toward right shoulder (11/13 images)
  - Shoulder rotation 20-40° creating 3/4 turn, one shoulder forward
  - Hand placement touching face/hair (5/13) or holding prop at chest level (6/13), fingers extended never clenched
  - Direct eye contact with viewer (7/13) or upward aspirational gaze
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** 70-80% figure dominance, bust or 3/4 length framing, tight cropping with minimal negative space, subject's face occupies 25-35% of total canvas area
- **Material Authenticity Anchor:** Oil paint surface with smooth facial blending contrasting visible hair/fabric brushwork; no digital smoothing artifacts, no photographic grain, no modern makeup contouring - **Likeness anchor: preserve source model's distinctive facial geometry (nose shape, jawline, cheekbone structure, face shape) while applying Runci's soft glamour rendering**
- **Period Consistency Anchor:** 1945-1955 Hollywood glamour conventions, post-war beauty standards (fuller figures than modern ideals, softer facial structure, period-appropriate hair/makeup)
- **Production Method Anchor:** Halftone dot pattern at 150 lpi for reproductions, four-color CMYK process, letterpress ink characteristics (dark halo edge with lighter center on dots), smooth coated paper substrate
- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for declared aspect ratio with atmospheric background extension maintaining tonal consistency

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions
### 5) Fashion & Attire – Wardrobe Matrix + Prop Selector

**Wardrobe tracks (feminine glamour):**

- **Evening glamour:** Strapless gowns, off-shoulder elegance, white fur stoles/trim, satin/silk fabrics, gold lamé accents
- **Casual sophistication:** Collared blouses, modest sweaters with pearl necklaces, pastel cardigans, white fabric headbands
- **Beach/leisure:** Strapless swimsuits with modest coverage, white terry cloth wraps, fabric hair accessories
- **Period construction:** 1940s-1950s silhouettes (fitted bodices, defined waist emphasis, fuller skirts when visible), no modern fashion elements

**Fabric behavior:**

- **Satin/silk:** Specular highlights with smooth gradation, crisp edge definition
- **Fur:** Soft halo effect with minimal texture detail, luminous white/cream tones
- **Cotton/terry:** Matte finish with subtle form shadows, softer edge transitions
- **Rendering principle:** Fabric identified through light behavior not surface texture

**Accessory caps:** Minimalist 0-2 items maximum

- **Jewelry:** Pearl necklaces, bracelets, subtle elegant pieces
- **Hair accessories:** Fabric headbands, flower corsages
- **Constraint:** Accessories support glamour aesthetic without cluttering composition

**Color palette restrictions:**

- **Dominant:** White, cream, pale yellow, pale pink, soft pastels (8/13 images)
- **Accent:** Emerald green, gold, coral, deep red for evening wear (3/13 images)
- **Saturation:** Medium-high chroma, never muted or dusty, jewel tones for contrast
- **Period accuracy:** 1940s-1950s textile dye technology, avoid neon or modern synthetic colors

**Wardrobe variation required:** If generating series, vary costume colors/styles between iterations while maintaining period aesthetic - cycle through pastel palette and evening jewel tones

**Props:** 1 hero prop maximum (total ≤1), fallback = no props

- **Primary function:** Establish commercial advertising context or add narrative interest
- **Period authenticity:** Props must be consistent with 1945-1955 material culture

**YAML prop pools:**

```

**Coherence filter:** All wardrobe/prop elements support 1945-1955 Hollywood glamour aesthetic and commercial advertising function; when in doubt, simplify and eliminate rather than risk anachronism

------

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)
### 6) Constraints

**Canvas Negatives (≥2):** Include ratio-specific and style-specific anti-patterns

*For declared ratio:*

- "original aspect ratio"
- "source dimensions"
- "unmodified framing"

*Style-specific prohibitions:*

- "sultry mysterious gaze"

- "recomposed for [format name]"

*Runci signature technique requirements:*

- "radiant confident smile showing teeth"
- "direct engaging eye contact OR upward aspirational gaze"
- "airbrush-smooth facial rendering"
- "visible brushstrokes in hair only"
- "eyes enlarged 130-140% proportion"
- "head tilt 15-35 degrees toward shoulder"
- "atmospheric gradient background"
- "soft vignette darker at edges"
- "70-80% figure dominance"
- "upper-left 45-degree key lighting"

**Vocabulary warnings:**

- Avoid "sultry," "mysterious," "brooding," "moody" - these contradict Runci's radiant approachable affect
- Avoid "realistic," "photographic," "detailed texture" - style uses idealized smoothness
- Avoid "ornate," "elaborate," "cluttered" - composition relies on elegant simplicity
- Avoid "edgy," "modern," "contemporary" - strict period adherence required

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns
### 7) Composition & Background

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

*For Portrait Ratios (2:3, 3:4, 4:5):*

- Vertical emphasis with subject positioned in upper 60-70% of frame
- Figure dominance 70-80% typical
- Bust or 3/4 length framing with tight cropping
- Atmospheric background extends to canvas edges via gradient

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective regime:** Shallow depth of field, 2-3 spatial planes maximum (background wash, figure, optional foreground prop), no architectural perspective
- **Grid/symmetry:** Slight off-center positioning for dynamic balance (subject occupies 50-60% width, positioned 40-60% from left edge)
- **Figure:ground %:** 70-80% figure dominance with minimal negative space
- **Density %:** Low environmental density, emphasis on singular subject and atmospheric color field
- **Lighting logic:**
  - Primary: Upper-left 45-degree key light creating form-defining shadows
  - Fill: Soft ambient fill light eliminating harsh contrasts, maintaining glamour glow
  - Rim: Optional hair/shoulder separation light
  - Effect: Dimensional modeling without dramatic noir darkness
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** High negative space in background (pure color field), concentrated detail in face/hair, simplified treatment of costume/props
- **Depth planes:**
  1. **Background:** Atmospheric gradient wash (darker at edges creating soft vignette)
  2. **Figure:** Primary subject in sharp focus with dimensional modeling
  3. **Foreground:** Optional prop (florals, beverage) in matching or slightly softer focus

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Commercial calendar or advertising poster presentation - image exists as printed lithographic reproduction on smooth coated paper stock
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** FORBIDDEN - no decorative presentation frames, no borders outside canvas edge, no mat treatment; only original canvas edge acceptable; subtle artist signature in lower corner if present
- **Production Context Anchor:**
  - *Original creation:* Oil on canvas, smooth surface preparation, glamour portrait technique
  - *Mass reproduction:* Halftone lithography, 150 lpi screen, four-color CMYK process, coated paper substrate, calendar or poster format
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for declared ratio with atmospheric background extension maintaining tonal consistency, no awkward cropping of figure

**BACKGROUND SPECIFICATIONS:**

- **Color treatment:** Solid atmospheric gradient, no patterns or textures
- **Typical palettes:**
  - *Dark dramatic:* Deep reds, forest greens, navy blues (5/13 images)
  - *Light airy:* Sky blues, soft pinks, cream (8/13 images)
- **Vignette effect:** Gradual darkening toward canvas edges (15-30% luminosity reduction)
- **Detail level:** Zero architectural or environmental detail, pure color field
- **Separation technique:** Color/value contrast between figure and background ensures clear silhouette

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)
### 8) Typography & Text Integration

**Binary:** Omit text (recommended for pure portrait)

**If text allowed (commercial advertising variant):**

- **Ratio-Appropriate Zones:**
  - Lower 15-20% of canvas for product tagline or calendar date
  - Upper corners for brand name (if commercial advertising context)
  - Text never overlaps figure's face or primary focal points
- **Copy limits:**
  - ≤6 words per line
  - ≤3 total text elements
  - Product/brand name + tagline maximum
  - Calendar date information if applicable
- **Period-Appropriate Typography:**
  - **Advertising headlines:** Bold serif or script fonts consistent with 1940s-1950s commercial typography
  - **Body copy:** Clean sans-serif or condensed serif for readability
  - **Calendar dates:** Simple numerals with month/year
- **Font recommendation:**
  - **Closest Google Fonts:**
    - *Headlines:* Playfair Display, Libre Baskerville (Didot analogs for elegance)
    - *Script:* Pacifico, Great Vibes (casual script for friendly appeal)
    - *Sans-serif:* Josefin Sans, Montserrat (geometric 1950s feel)
  - **Better professional alternatives:** Futura (1927), Bodoni, Caslon, Baskerville, Copperplate Gothic
  - **Period accuracy:** Fonts must match 1945-1955 advertising typography; no modern digital-native fonts
- **Format-Specific Text Rules:**
  - **Calendar mode:** Month/year display in lower portion, optional inspirational tagline
  - **Advertising mode:** Product name + tagline, minimal text for visual impact
  - **Portrait mode:** Omit text entirely for pure glamour presentation
- **Historical accuracy:** Typography must reflect post-war American advertising conventions - confident optimistic messaging, clear hierarchical layout, elegant but approachable fonts
- **Production Method Integration:** Text rendered with halftone reproduction characteristics matching image (150 lpi screen, CMYK four-color process)
