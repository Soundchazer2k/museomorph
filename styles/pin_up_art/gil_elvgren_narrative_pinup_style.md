# Gil Elvgren Narrative Pin-Up Style

**Version:** 1.0
 **Artist:** Gil Elvgren (1914-1980)
 **Genre:** 1940s-1970s American Commercial Pin-Up Art - Narrative Storytelling Subgenre
 **Purpose:** Authentic replication of Elvgren's "girl-next-door" narrative aesthetic with realistic anatomy, environmental storytelling, and oil painting technique

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Likeness Preservation Priority:** Maintain source model's core identifying features (hair color, eye color, facial structure, complexion tone) while applying Elvgren's realistic painting idealization; style enhances rather than replaces identity
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("45-50% realistic leg proportion", "50-70% figure dominance", "30-50% environmental context", "3-5 spatial depth planes") override descriptive language
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Oil painting technique with dimensional color modeling supersedes airbrush or digital rendering
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** `elvgren-narrative-realism`, `girl-next-door-charm`, `accidental-exposure-humor`, `environmental-storytelling`, `realistic-anatomy-NOT-elongated`
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Reject extreme stylization - embrace anatomical realism and believable scenarios
- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**
  - *Elvgren Signature:* `oil-painted-dimensional`, `warm-cool-color-modeling`, `realistic-features`, `playful-expression`
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `narrative-action-moment`, `surprised-delight`, `playful-predicament`, `dynamic-movement`
- **Canvas Control Flags (choose one):** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`, `format-native`
- **Material Physics Authority:** Oil on canvas with visible brushwork and dimensional color theory
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Viewing distance optimized for calendar/advertising display (12-24 inches)
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes
- **Safety/IP:** **No nudity**; **no undergarments visible** (no panties, no brassiere); accidental wardrobe exposure LIMITED to period hosiery accessories (stockings, garter straps, garter belt) revealed through innocent action within wholesome humor context; **no artist signatures or watermarks**; no copyrighted brand elements
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Adult female subjects (apparent age 20-28); wholesome girl-next-door presentation
- **Gender expression:** Relatable feminine presentation consistent with 1940s-1960s American idealized beauty
- **Material authenticity:** Authentic oil painting surface with visible brushwork, warm/cool color shifts, dimensional modeling; no airbrush flatness, no modern digital effects
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1940-1980 oil paintings reproduced via commercial printing for calendar/advertising distribution
- **Composition boundaries:** No decorative frames outside canvas; no artificial presentation borders, watermarks, or signatures
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid extreme elongation, airbrush flatness, flat void backgrounds, isolated figures, sultry expressions, static posing, missing props
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail

------

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate
### 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely
- Redraw in **Gil Elvgren narrative pin-up style** for **1940s-1970s commercial calendar/advertising artwork**
- **Likeness Mandate:** Identity via source model's actual hair color, eye color, facial structure, and complexion preserved through Elvgren's realistic oil painting technique - style enhances features while maintaining recognizability and realistic human proportions
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original character design avoiding copyrighted elements; **no artist signatures or watermarks anywhere on image**; create original props/settings as needed
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-painted-dimensional`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `narrative-action-moment`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** [select appropriate]
- **Style Dominance:** Elvgren narrative realism (anatomically plausible figures, environmental storytelling, playful surprise, oil painting technique, props-driven scenarios) overrides Vargas extreme stylization or sultry sophistication
- **Mode Selector:** Commercial calendar narrative illustration

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control
### 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION (choose one exact specification):**

**PORTRAIT FORMATS:**

- `2:3` (standard calendar preferred)
- `3:4` (classical portrait alternate)
- `4:5` (modern poster adaptation)

**LANDSCAPE FORMATS:**

- `4:3` (horizontal narrative scene)
- `16:9` (panoramic storytelling)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Extend environmental setting to fill declared ratio while maintaining 50-70% figure dominance with 30-50% narrative context
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure positioned within believable environmental scenario - not floating in void
- **Background Treatment:** Fully rendered three-dimensional setting with atmospheric perspective, architectural/natural elements, props establishing narrative
- **Format Justification:** [Ratio] provides optimal balance between figure emphasis and environmental storytelling for commercial calendar narrative illustration

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity
### 3) Artistic Style & Context

- **Influences:** American illustration golden age (Norman Rockwell narrative clarity), commercial advertising art, Hollywood publicity photography (glamour but relatable), pin-up photography (poses and scenarios), oil painting academic tradition (realistic anatomy, dimensional modeling)
- **Medium/Production method:**
  - *Original:* Oil on canvas with visible brushwork, dimensional color modeling using warm/cool shifts, realistic anatomical rendering
  - *Reproduction:* Commercial offset lithography for calendar/advertising distribution, high-quality color printing
- **Thematic purpose:** Commercial calendar art combining wholesome girl-next-door appeal with narrative humor; accidental exposure scenarios creating playful embarrassment; relatable feminine charm for mainstream American audience
- **Hallmark motifs:**
  - **Narrative scenario:** Every image tells story - figure caught in moment of playful predicament, accidental wardrobe malfunction, surprised reaction to situation
  - **Realistic anatomy:** Figures anatomically plausible with realistic leg-to-height proportion, natural curves, believable human proportions - NOT extreme stylization
  - **Environmental storytelling:** Composition devoted to fully rendered setting - lakesides, carnivals, domestic interiors, outdoor recreation - establishing narrative context
  - **Props essential:** Props ALWAYS present driving narrative - fishing poles, carousel horses, household items, recreational equipment, companion animals
  - **Playful surprised expression:** Caught-in-the-act delight, innocent mischief, wholesome embarrassment - NEVER sultry sophistication or static confidence
  - **Oil painting technique:** Visible brushstrokes in fabric/hair/background, dimensional color modeling with warm/cool shifts, realistic light and shadow
  - **Seamed stockings and garters:** Visible through narrative "accident" - skirt blown up, leg extended, clothing displaced
  - **Girl-next-door charm:** Relatable, approachable, wholesome femininity - not untouchable glamour
- **Period framing:** Commercial calendar art golden age (1940-1980), post-war American prosperity and leisure culture
- **Tone Tag:** Playful, surprised, wholesome, mischievous, relatable, humorous
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Original oil paintings (1940-1980) reproduced via commercial printing for Brown & Bigelow and other calendar companies

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making
### 4) Technical Execution (≥5 anchors + measurement specifications)

- **Oil painting rendering method:** Traditional oil on canvas technique with visible brushstrokes, dimensional paint application, layered color buildup, realistic blending in skin contrasting with harder edges in fabric/props
- **Facial rendering:** Dimensional modeling using warm/cool color shifts - warm peachy-cream base with cool mauve shadows, warm yellow-cream highlights, realistic feature definition with proper anatomical proportions, expressive eyes showing active emotion (surprise, delight, mischief)
- **Hair rendering:** Visible brushwork creating dimensional volume, color layering for depth, period-appropriate 1940s-1960s styling (victory rolls, curls, ponytails, updos), varied edge quality from soft to defined - **CRITICAL: Preserve source model's actual hair color (blonde/brunette/auburn/red) and apply Elvgren's oil painting technique to that natural color**
- **Eye construction:** Large expressive but realistically proportioned, dimensional modeling around lids, realistic iris detail, active emotional expression - **CRITICAL: Preserve source model's actual eye color and apply Elvgren's dimensional painting to that natural color**
- **Skin tone palette:** Base tone matches source model's natural complexion adapted to Elvgren's warm peachy-cream ideal with dimensional warm/cool color variation - warm shadows (browns, mauves), cool mid-tones, warm highlights (cream-yellow), oil painting color theory creating form through temperature shifts not flat airbrushing
- **Anatomical realism:** Realistic human proportions with 45-50% leg-to-height ratio (NOT 60-75% elongation), naturally narrow waist but anatomically plausible, realistic feminine curves (fuller hips than Vargas), natural shoulder width, realistic arm length - figures could exist in reality
- **Body rendering:** Dimensional anatomical modeling with subtle musculature suggesting health, realistic skin color variation (warmer in light, cooler in shadow), visible fabric weight and draping on form, proper foreshortening in dynamic poses
- **Environmental execution:** Fully rendered 3-5 depth planes with atmospheric perspective - foreground props sharp, mid-ground figure detailed, background with scale diminishment and atmospheric blue shift, natural outdoor lighting or interior lighting scenarios with directional shadows
- **Brushwork visibility:** Face smoothly blended but not airbrush flat, visible brushstrokes in hair creating dimensional texture, clear directional strokes in fabric folds, loose painterly treatment in backgrounds, props rendered with material-specific handling
- **Lighting architecture:** Natural directional lighting from specific source (sun, window, interior fixture) creating cast shadows establishing spatial relationships, warm outdoor sunlight or cool interior light, dimensional form shadows on figure, environmental shadows grounding scene
- **Prop rendering:** 1-3 props ALWAYS present with functional clarity - fishing poles, musical instruments, carnival equipment, household items, companion animals (dogs frequent) - rendered with enough detail to read narrative function, integrated into action
- **Edge treatment:** Defined realistic edges where figure meets environment (NOT soft airbrushed blending), crisp fabric folds showing material weight and character, clear prop silhouettes for narrative readability
- **Color modeling technique:** Warm/cool color temperature shifts creating dimensional form (warm advancing, cool receding), oil painting color mixing visible in transitions, atmospheric perspective cooling distant elements, directional light color (warm sun, cool sky) influencing entire scene
- **Pose Anchors:**
  - Dynamic action frozen mid-gesture - casting fishing line, sliding down slide, surprised reaction, reaching for object
  - Realistic human movement and balance (NOT impossible contortions)
  - Legs realistically proportioned 45-50% of height, often one leg extended or bent creating dynamic line
  - Hands actively using props or gesturing in narrative context (NOT decorative touching face)
  - Direct playful eye contact with viewer (8/13) or looking at action/prop in scene
  - Accidental wardrobe exposure through innocent action - skirt blown up, stocking seam visible, garter revealed
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** 50-70% figure dominance with 30-50% environmental narrative context, balanced composition telling complete story, figure integrated into believable setting NOT isolated in void
- **Material Authenticity Anchor:** Oil paint surface with visible brushwork creating texture, warm/cool color temperature modeling, realistic light behavior on materials; no airbrush flatness, no digital smoothing - **Likeness anchor: preserve source model's distinctive facial geometry while applying Elvgren's dimensional oil painting realism**
- **Period Consistency Anchor:** 1940-1980 American leisure culture, wholesome girl-next-door aesthetic, accidental exposure humor, realistic beauty ideals
- **Production Method Anchor:** High-quality commercial offset lithography reproducing oil painting for calendar distribution
- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for declared aspect ratio with environmental setting extension maintaining spatial logic and narrative coherence

### 5) Fashion & Attire – Wardrobe Matrix + Prop Selector

**Wardrobe tracks (wholesome 1940s-1970s American girl-next-door):**

- **Casual wear:** Shorts/tops, skirts/blouses, casual dresses, everyday American fashion
- **Swimwear:** One-piece bathing suits, modest 1940s-1960s coverage
- **Lingerie/sleepwear:** Slips, robes, nightwear - revealed accidentally through narrative not posed
- **Costumes/performance:** Carnival outfits, western wear, performance attire for narrative context
- **Period construction:** 1940s-1970s silhouettes and styling, no modern fashion anachronisms

**Fabric behavior:**

- **Rendering:** Dimensional fabric weight shown through realistic draping, folds indicating material (heavy cotton, light silk, structured wool), fabric response to movement and gravity
- **Detail:** Visible seams, buttons, trim details rendered with oil painting brushwork
- **Interaction:** Fabric displaced by wind, action, or accident creating narrative

**Stockings and hosiery:**

- **Style:** Seamed stockings, visible garter straps and garter belt
- **Narrative function:** Often revealed "accidentally" through action - skirt blown up, leg extended, clothing displaced
- **CRITICAL BOUNDARY:** Show stockings/garters/garter belt ONLY - **NEVER show undergarments (panties, brassiere)**
- **Period accuracy:** 1940s-1960s hosiery styling with wholesome "oops" humor

**Footwear:** Heels typical

- **Types:** Pumps, ankle straps, saddle shoes, period-appropriate styles
- **Colors:** Coordinated with costume
- **Rendering:** Dimensional form, material indication (leather, fabric)

**Accessory caps:** Moderate variety

- **Types:** Hair bows, jewelry, belts, hats
- **Constraint:** Accessories support narrative, never clutter composition

**Color palette restrictions:**

- **Costumes:** Bright primaries (red, blue, yellow), pastels (pink, lavender), white
- **Saturation:** High chroma vibrant colors typical of commercial calendar art

  - Source: Natural directional from specific location (sun, window, lamp)
  - Shadows: Cast shadows on ground/objects establishing spatial relationships
  - Quality: Warm outdoor sunlight or cool interior lighting scenarios
  - Effect: Dimensional form modeling through consistent light direction
  - **NEVER:** Diffuse ethereal glow, ambient non-directional light, figure seeming to emit own light
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** Balanced detail distribution - highest on figure face, high on figure body/props, moderate-high on near environment, atmospheric reduction in distance
- **Depth planes:**
  1. **Foreground:** Props, environmental elements in sharp focus
  2. **Mid-ground:** Figure with highest detail and dimensional modeling
  3. **Background-near:** Environmental context (architecture, furniture, ground plane) with clear detail
  4. **Background-mid:** Setting elements with moderate detail
