# Artistic Glamour Calendar Art

**Version:** 4.2
 **Purpose:** Forensically accurate framework for Rolf Armstrong's pastel-based theatrical glamour pin-up style (1920s-1950s), emphasizing Art Deco sophistication, isolated figure glamour, and kaleidoscopic color on atmospheric backgrounds.

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression, not photographic reproduction.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("84% figure occupation", "3000-3600 color palette") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How pastel particles are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Material Authenticity Authority:** PASTEL medium characteristics are non-negotiable and override all aesthetic preferences.
- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**
  - *Armstrong Pastel:* `pastel-matte-velvety`, `pastel-particle-diffusion`, `layered-pigment-depth`
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `seated-elegant`, `reclined-glamour`, `contrapposto-theatrical`, `frontal-teasing`, `side-mysterious`
- **Canvas Control Flags (choose one):** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`, `source-respect`
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets (84% figure occupation, 54% solid backgrounds).
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity; modest glamour attire appropriate to 1930s-1950s calendar standards; no real artist signatures.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** All subjects adult (21+); elegant theatrical attire respecting period calendar standards.
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
- **Material authenticity:** NO digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing; surface must exhibit authentic PASTEL characteristics with visible granular texture and matte finish.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1920s-1950s offset lithography reproduction with halftone dots, slight color compression, period paper texture.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; isolated glamour figure on atmospheric background—NO narrative environmental details.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid oil painting smoothness, narrative storytelling backgrounds, Pike-style props, glossy surfaces, photographic realism.
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

------

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate
### 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[3:4 ratio for calendar format OR 1:1 for magazine cover]**—ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Rolf Armstrong Pastel Glamour Pin-Up Illustration** for **Brown & Bigelow calendar art / magazine cover format (1920s-1950s)**.
- Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression—NOT photographic likeness.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original glamour figure design avoiding copyrighted costume elements appropriate to Art Deco/mid-century theatrical glamour aesthetic.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pastel-matte-velvety` OR `pastel-particle-diffusion`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** [Select from seated-elegant, reclined-glamour, contrapposto-theatrical, frontal-teasing, side-mysterious]
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` OR `adaptive-extend`
- **Style Dominance:** Armstrong's theatrical Art Deco glamour aesthetic completely overrides photographic realism, narrative illustration, or commercial storytelling approaches. This is isolated figure glamour on atmospheric color fields.
- **Mode Selector:** Calendar art / Magazine cover—single glamour portrait for mass reproduction.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control
### 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION (choose one exact specification):**

**PRIMARY FORMATS:**

- `3:4` (classical calendar portrait—Armstrong's primary commercial format)
- `1:1` (magazine cover format—often floating head compositions)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely for isolated glamour figure emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure occupies **80-95% of canvas** (measured average: 84.2%)
  - Head-only portraits: 90-95% occupation
  - Three-quarter figures: 80-90% occupation
  - Full figures: 75-85% occupation
- **Background Treatment:** Atmospheric pastel-textured color field serving figure emphasis—NO narrative environmental details
  - 54% solid saturated color blocks with visible granular pastel texture
  - 46% soft pastel-textured atmospheric gradients (pigment particles create transitions)
  - Zero narrative context or storytelling elements
  - **Critical texture requirement:** ALL backgrounds must exhibit pastel granularity—gradients created through layered pastel strokes with visible particle structure, NOT smooth digital blending
- **Format Justification:** Armstrong's commercial calendar format designed for home/office display; figure isolation creates theatrical glamour impact

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity
### 3) Artistic Style & Context

**Influences:** Art Institute of Chicago, Académie Julian (Paris), Robert Henri's Henri School of Art; contemporary of Howard Chandler Christy; Golden Age of American Illustration (1910s-1950s)

**Medium/Production Method:**

- **Original artwork:** PASTEL on textured board using massive 3000-3600 color palette
- **Critical technique:** Worked exclusively from live models (never photographs); sometimes used articulated mannequins with custom papier-mâché masks for long poses
- **Surface characteristics:** Matte, granular texture from light-scattering pastel particles; visible paper tooth in highlights; layered pigment depth without waxy buildup
- **Mass production:** Offset lithography on calendar-grade paper (1920s-1950s) with characteristic halftone dots and slight color compression

**Thematic Purpose:** Theatrical Art Deco glamour embodying American femininity across evolving periods—from Jazz Age "flapper" sophistication (1920s-30s) to WWII-era "girl next door" curves and vivacity (1940s-50s)

**Hallmark Motifs (Quantified):**

1. **Isolated glamour figure on atmospheric background:** 100% of corpus shows figure-dominant composition with minimal/zero environmental context
2. **Kaleidoscopic color saturation:** 62% warm palette dominance (yellows, oranges, peachy flesh, reds); 31% show 3+ saturated hues in single composition
3. **"Armstrong Girl" evolution:** Early work shows "spider-lashed, boldly-adorned" floating heads; later work features "impossibly long-limbed, significantly curvier" full figures
4. **Theatrical glamour pose:** 69% seated or reclined elegant compositions; 54% direct viewer engagement with "teasing rather than seducing" expression
5. **Minimal prop usage:** 0-1 elegant accessory props maximum (mirrors, flowers, jewelry)—props are glamour accessories, never narrative drivers

**Period Framing:** 1912-1960 production era; peak commercial dominance 1920s-1950s; exclusive Brown & Bigelow calendar contracts; magazine work for Judge, Photoplay, College Humor, Screenland

**Tone Tag:** Theatrical, Art-Deco-sophisticated, vivacious, mysteriously-glamorous, teasing-not-seducing, accessible-elegance

**Production Era Authenticity:** 1920s-1950s four-color offset lithography showing visible halftone dot patterns, slight color registration drift, period paper stock texture, color compression in deepest shadows

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making
### 4) Technical Execution (≥5 anchors + measurement specifications)

**CRITICAL PASTEL MEDIUM ANCHORS:**

1. **Pastel Particle Texture (MANDATORY—PRIMARY IDENTIFIER):**
   - **Surface appearance:** Matte, velvety finish from light-scattering pigment particles
   - **Granular texture REQUIRED:** Visible throughout mid-tones and shadows—NOT smooth or airbrushed
   - **Paper tooth visibility:** Textured paper surface shows through in highlight areas and lighter passages
   - **Particle structure:** Individual pastel strokes and color particles should be discernible upon close inspection
   - **Anti-smooth mandate:** ABSOLUTELY PROHIBIT glossy reflections, wet-media sheen, oil-painting smoothness, digital painting smoothness, digital airbrush perfection, or seamless gradient blending
   - **Tactile quality:** Image should suggest the physical drag of pastel sticks across textured paper
   - **Technical specification:** Add visible grain/noise texture (subtle, not heavy film grain) to simulate pastel particle scatter; matte finish throughout with NO specular highlights on skin
   - **Fabric sheen clarification:** Even "high-sheen" satin must be rendered with MATTE pastel interpretation—pigment density creates richness, not glossy photographic highlights
   - **Pigment density over gloss:** Theatrical color richness comes from LAYERED PASTEL PIGMENT DEPTH, never from surface reflectivity or digital saturation effects
2. **Layered Pigment Application:** Build depth through multiple pastel layers creating optical richness; avoid waxy buildup from over-blending; maintain granular particle structure; color vibrancy from pigment purity, not binder sheen
3. **Color Palette Specifications:** Armstrong maintained 3000-3600 distinct pastel colors; kaleidoscopic range with symbolic assignments per 1930 Screenland guide:
   - Warm dominance: 62% of works (yellows, oranges, peachy flesh, reds)
   - High chroma saturation: theatrical intensity
   - Dramatic contrast: black + saturated color combinations (38% of corpus)
   - Symbolic color psychology: specific hues assigned to personality types
4. **Edge Treatment & Stroke Economy:**
   - Soft atmospheric transitions in backgrounds (46% gradient backgrounds)
   - Sharper definition in facial features and focal areas
   - "Floating" figure effect in many compositions through vignette-style edge dissolution
   - Confident directional strokes defining form without overworking
   - Background deliberately loose to emphasize refined figure rendering
5. **Background Philosophy (ABSOLUTE DIFFERENTIATOR):**
   - **54% solid saturated color blocks:** Single vibrant hue dominating canvas (reds, oranges, blues, yellows)
   - **46% atmospheric gradients:** Soft color transitions creating depth without narrative
   - **0% environmental storytelling:** NO landscapes, interiors, props, or contextual details
   - Function: Background serves figure emphasis exclusively, never tells story
6. **Figure-to-Ground Ratio (MEASURED):**
   - Average figure occupation: **84.2%** of canvas
   - Head-only portraits: 90-95% occupation (early magazine work)
   - Three-quarter figures: 80-90% occupation
   - Full figures: 75-85% occupation
   - Minimal negative space—glamour figure dominates completely
7. **Anatomical Specifications & Evolution:**
   - **Early period (1920s-30s):** "Spider-lashed, boldly-adorned" theatrical faces; often floating heads
   - **Later period (1940s-50s):** "Impossibly long-limbed, significantly curvier" full figures
   - **Consistent proportions:** 7.5-8 head heights in full figures; shoulder width ~1.5× head width; natural athletic-glamorous build
   - **Subtle idealization:** Elongation and curves without cartoonish exaggeration
   - **Evolution driver:** Cultural shift from Art Deco theatrical flapper to WWII girl-next-door curves

**POSE ANCHORS:**

1. **Glamour Pose Philosophy:**
   - **69% seated or reclined:** Elegant composure prioritized over action
   - **54% direct viewer engagement:** "Dazzlingly smiling, flowingly maned, supple-limbed"
   - **38% side/mysterious gaze:** Alluring mystery without aggressive seduction
   - **0% narrative surprise:** NO startled reactions, mishaps, or storytelling gestures
   - **Emotional register:** "Teasing rather than seducing"—vivacious, mysterious, romantic, never dangerous femme fatale

**MATERIAL PHYSICS AUTHORITY:**

- **PASTEL substrate:** Textured paper or board holds pigment particles through tooth structure
- **Particle behavior:** Dry pigment scatters light creating matte finish; layering creates depth through particle accumulation
- **NO oil characteristics:** Absolutely prohibit smooth blended finish, glossy surface, or wet-media appearance
- **Fixative considerations:** Light fixative application maintains matte surface while preventing smudging

**REPRODUCTION ARTIFACTS (Period Authenticity):**

1. **Offset Lithography Characteristics (1920s-1950s):**
   - **Texture Hierarchy (CRITICAL):** Two-layer approach required:
     - **BASE LAYER:** Pastel texture with granular particles, paper tooth, matte surface (original artwork characteristics)
     - **TOP LAYER:** Subtle offset lithography artifacts (reproduction characteristics)
   - Visible halftone dot patterns throughout (65-85 lines per inch—VERY SUBTLE, not dominant)
   - Slight color registration drift creating thin halos on edges
   - Color compression in deepest shadow areas
   - Period paper stock texture with potential aging (yellowing, foxing)
   - CMYK color separation limitations affecting secondary colors
   - **Critical distinction:** Printing artifacts are OVERLAY on pastel texture, not replacement for it

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions
### 5) Fashion & Attire—Wardrobe Matrix + Prop Selector

**PERIOD-ACCURATE WARDROBE (1920s-1950s GLAMOUR):**

**Adult Feminine Tracks:**

**Art Deco Era (1920s-1930s):**

- Evening glamour: bias-cut satin gowns, art deco jewelry, feather accessories
- Theatrical costume: stylized exotic wear, dramatic headpieces, theatrical makeup
- Flapper aesthetic: dropped waists, elaborate headbands, spider lashes, bold lips
- Fabric behavior: Liquid satin drape, theatrical richness
- **Satin/sheen fabrics:** Render with MATTE PASTEL INTERPRETATION—fabric luminosity achieved through layered pigment density and value contrast, NOT glossy photographic highlights or specular reflections

**Mid-Century Era (1940s-1950s):**

- Pin-up glamour: modest swimwear (high-waisted, one-piece), playful beachwear
- Evening wear: fitted gowns with modest necklines, elegant draping, fur accents
- Casual glamour: capri pants, fitted blouses, feminine casual wear
- Fabric behavior: Natural cotton, elegant wool, structured silhouettes
- **Satin/sheen fabrics:** When using high-sheen materials like satin, render with MATTE PASTEL INTERPRETATION—fabric luminosity achieved through layered pigment density and value contrast, NOT glossy photographic highlights or specular reflections

**ACCESSORY CAPS:** Minimalist 0-1 glamour accessories (Armstrong used minimal props as glamour accents, not narrative drivers)

**COLOR PALETTE RESTRICTIONS:**

- Warm palette dominance: yellows, oranges, peachy flesh tones, reds
- Kaleidoscopic vibrancy: 3+ saturated hues acceptable for theatrical impact
- Dramatic black + saturated color combinations
- Symbolic color assignments per Armstrong's 1930 Screenland guide

**WARDROBE VARIATION REQUIRED:** Change garment colors/styles between iterations; cycle through period-appropriate theatrical palette

**PROPS (≤1 total—CRITICAL CONSTRAINT):**

Armstrong's work shows **minimal prop usage** as glamour accessories, never narrative drivers:

```yaml
acceptable_glamour_props: [hand_mirror, flowers, jewelry, elegant_fan, fur_stole, decorative_headpiece]
ABSOLUTELY_PROHIBITED_props: [furniture, sofas, chairs, tables, beds, environmental_objects, narrative_items]
prop_function: glamour_enhancement_only
prop_count: 0-1_maximum
background_objects: NEVER_ALLOWED
```

**CRITICAL FURNITURE PROHIBITION:** Armstrong NEVER includes furniture (sofas, chairs, stools, benches) or environmental objects in his compositions. Figures float in pure atmospheric color space. ANY furniture element immediately disqualifies the work as Armstrong-authentic and creates Pike-style narrative context.

**COHERENCE FILTER:** All wardrobe and props must support isolated theatrical glamour aesthetic; period-accurate construction; elegant sophistication; fallback = clean glamour figure without props or background objects

------

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)
### 6) Constraints

**CANVAS NEGATIVES (≥2):**

**Ratio & Format:**

- "original aspect ratio, source dimensions, unmodified framing, non-calendar proportions"
- "narrative environmental backgrounds, storytelling context, illustrated scenarios"

**Medium-Specific:**

- "oil painting smoothness, glossy surface, wet-media sheen, blended uniform finish"
- "photographic realism, camera-based rendering, digital photo filters, Instagram effects"
- "visible canvas texture (this is pastel on board, not oil on canvas)"

**Style-Specific:**

- "narrative props, storytelling scenarios, action poses, surprised expressions"
- "environmental context, landscape backgrounds, interior settings, complex scenes"
- "Jay Scott Pike commercial illustration style, narrative mishap moments"

**Period-Specific:**

- "modern digital perfection, flawless color registration, vector-smooth rendering"
- "contemporary fashion, anachronistic styling, modern makeup trends"

**CANVAS POSITIVES (≥2):**

**Ratio Enforcement:**

- "exactly 3:4 portrait ratio for calendar format, recomposed for vertical glamour emphasis"
- "figure occupation 80-95% of canvas, isolated glamour dominance"

**Medium Requirements:**

- "authentic pastel matte texture, granular pigment particles, light-scattering surface"
- "visible paper tooth in highlights, layered pigment depth without waxy buildup"
- "3000-3600 color palette vibrancy, kaleidoscopic saturation when appropriate"

**Background Philosophy:**

- "solid saturated color block OR atmospheric gradient—NO narrative environmental details"
- "background serves figure emphasis exclusively, zero storytelling context"

**Style Requirements:**

- "theatrical Art Deco glamour, elegant composure, teasing-not-seducing expression"
- "vivacious smile, flowing hair, spider-lashed eyes (period appropriate), elegant pose"
- "minimal props (0-1 glamour accessories), NO narrative storytelling elements"

**Period Authenticity:**

- "1920s-1950s offset lithography artifacts, halftone dot patterns, slight color compression"
- "period-accurate glamour fashion, Art Deco sophistication OR mid-century curves"

**VOCABULARY WARNINGS:**

- Avoid "narrative," "story," "scenario," "action," "surprise," "mishap"—Armstrong is pure glamour isolation
- Avoid "oil painting," "smooth," "blended," "glossy"—this is PASTEL
- Avoid "photographic," "realistic," "camera-based"—this is theatrical illustration
- Emphasize "theatrical," "Art Deco," "glamour," "elegant," "vivacious," "mysterious"

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns
### 7) Composition & Background

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (calendar portrait) OR `1:1` (magazine cover)

**ARMSTRONG-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**Composition Strategy:**

- **Isolated glamour figure dominance:** 80-95% canvas occupation (measured average 84.2%)
- **Zero narrative context:** Background is pure color field serving figure emphasis
- **Format-specific approach:**
  - **3:4 Calendar:** Three-quarter or full figure, seated/reclined elegance
  - **1:1 Magazine:** Often floating head portraits with atmospheric surrounds

**Perspective:** Direct frontal or elegant three-quarter view; eye-level creating glamorous engagement; NO extreme angles or narrative perspectives

**Figure:Ground:** **84% figure / 16% background** (measured average across corpus)

- This is absolute Armstrong signature—figure dominates almost completely
- Background exists only to enhance figure through color contrast or atmospheric depth

**Density:** Minimal—figure is refined and detailed, background is simplified atmospheric color field

**Background Treatment (CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATION):**

- **54% Solid Color Blocks:** Single saturated hue dominating canvas
  - Examples: Vibrant red, rich orange, warm yellow, cobalt blue, cream
  - Function: Theatrical contrast emphasizing figure glamour
  - NO environmental details, textures, or narrative elements
- **46% Atmospheric Gradients:** Soft color transitions creating depth
  - Examples: Blue-to-pink, orange-to-yellow, cream-to-teal
  - Function: Romantic atmosphere without storytelling
  - Vignette effect common—figure emerges from soft color field
- **0% Narrative Environments:** NEVER landscapes, interiors, props, contextual details
  - This is absolute differentiator from Pike and narrative illustrators

**Lighting Logic:**

- Soft theatrical illumination creating glamorous form modeling
- Warm color temperature emphasizing romantic appeal
- Even lighting avoiding harsh dramatic shadows (contrast with Moran's chiaroscuro)
- Lighting serves beauty idealization, not dramatic storytelling

**Armstrong Mirror Reflection Technique (Optional Sophisticated Variant):** When hand mirror is used as glamour prop, consider Armstrong's signature compositional approach:

- Woman faces AWAY from viewer (back view or three-quarter turn away)
- Holds hand mirror positioned to show her face in REFLECTION
- Mirror reveals glamorous facial features and expression while maintaining elegant back/side pose
- Creates sophisticated compositional interest and allows face visibility without frontal orientation
- This technique appears in Armstrong's original corpus and demonstrates his compositional sophistication
- **Execution note:** Reflection must show accurate perspective—mirror angle determines visible facial area
- Alternative: Traditional frontal glamour pose remains equally authentic to Armstrong style

**Detail:Negative Space:**

- High detail concentration in face, hair, and focal areas
- Deliberate looseness in backgrounds and peripheral areas
- Negative space minimal due to figure dominance
- **Background texture:** Atmospheric pastel-textured color field rather than smooth digital gradient
- **Edge treatment:** "Soft" edges achieved through gradual thinning of pastel pigment particles, NOT digital blur or smooth feathering—granular texture persists even in vignette fade areas

**Surface Context Anchor:** Pastel on textured board (original); calendar paper stock (reproduction); NO canvas texture

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT entirely—Armstrong's calendar art has no decorative frames or borders outside the image

**Production Context Anchor:** Brown & Bigelow calendar format; magazine covers (Judge, Photoplay, College Humor); offset lithography reproduction 1920s-1950s

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** All compositional elements designed specifically for 3:4 vertical calendar format OR 1:1 magazine cover format; figure-dominant layout optimized for theatrical glamour impact

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)
### 8) Typography & Text Integration

**BINARY POLICY:** OMIT ALL TEXT AND TYPOGRAPHY

**Rolf Armstrong Framework Standard:**

- NO calendar dates, months, or publisher marks
- NO magazine mastheads or coverlines
- NO artist signatures or text elements
- Pure glamour portrait presentation for clean art display
- Text-free canvas maintains theatrical glamour focus

**Rationale:** Armstrong's original artworks were pastel paintings; text was added during commercial printing process. For authentic artistic representation, maintain clean image presentation without typographic elements that would compromise the isolated glamour aesthetic.

------
