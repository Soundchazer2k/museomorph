# George Petty Pin-Up Illustration

**Based on visual analysis of 17 authentic artworks (1933-1955)**

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `diffusion-glam`
 **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion`
 **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
 **Style Dominance:** Petty's streamlined aesthetic overrides photographic likeness; identity conveyed through gesture, expression, silhouette.

**CANVAS OVERRIDE MANDATE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** – ignore source image dimensions completely.

**Safety Guardrails:**

- No nudity or suggestive posing
- Modest period-appropriate attire only
- No underwear visible
- No controversial political imagery
- No copyrighted logos or trademarks
- No real signatures or watermarks
- Subject must appear adult (age 21+)
- Respectful gender expression
- No frames outside canvas
- No artificial presentation borders or watermarks

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 portrait ratio** for 1930s-1940s magazine page format. Ignore source dimensions.

Redraw subject in **George Petty 1930s-1940s American Pin-Up Illustration style** for magazine print reproduction.

**IP Safeguard:** Create original costume designs avoiding copyrighted elements. No recognizable brand imagery, logos, or trademarked symbols.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `diffusion-glam`
 **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion`
 **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance:** Petty's streamlined Depression-era fantasy aesthetic supersedes photographic realism. Convey identity through sophisticated gesture, playful expression, and exaggerated silhouette rather than facial likeness.

**Mode:** Single magazine illustration print.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (portrait magazine page format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely for vertical portrait emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure occupies 75-90% of composition height, centered horizontally
- **Background Treatment:** Extend stark white background to fill 2:3 canvas completely
- **Format Justification:** Magazine tear-out format designed for pinning up; vertical orientation maximizes leg elongation visual effect

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity
## 3) Artistic Style & Context

**Influences:** 1930s Streamline Moderne industrial design aesthetic applied to female form; airbrush commercial illustration technique refined in photographic retouching studios.

**Medium/Production Method:**

- Original: Watercolor and gouache on illustration board using precision airbrush with transparent frisket masking, combined with red/orange gestural line underdrawing
- Reproduction: Offset lithography on 1930s-1940s magazine paper stock with period printing limitations

**Thematic Purpose:** Depression-era masculine fantasy commodity for Esquire magazine – sophisticated, consumer-focused "Petty Girl" personality presenting tasteful consumption lifestyle. Not wholesome patriotism.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Head size 60-70% realistic proportion** – deliberately shrunk relative to body
2. **Leg elongation 150-180% realistic length** – unnaturally extended limbs
3. **Torso elongation 120-140% realistic length** – statuesque vertical emphasis
4. **Neck elongation 110-120% realistic length** – subtle but consistent
5. **Boneless tapered fingers** – delicate, impossibly graceful hands

**Period Framing:** 1933-1955, peak work 1933-1941 for Esquire magazine; later work for True magazine and Ridge Tool Company calendars.

**Tone Tag:** Playful sophistication, knowing glamour, consumer fantasy, Depression-era escapism.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Wartime paper rationing meant lighter-weight, cheaper paper stock; period offset lithography with color registration limitations and visible paper texture.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making
## 4) Technical Execution

### CRITICAL MIXED RENDERING MANDATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

**MANDATORY GESTURAL LINE WORK REQUIREMENT:** At least one hand AND both feet MUST show visible red/orange gestural line underdrawing with minimal or NO airbrush rendering. This mixed technique is the signature Petty characteristic that distinguishes authentic work from generic pin-up illustration. Failure to include visible sketch lines in extremities produces inauthentic results.

**PROHIBITED:** Uniform full rendering across all body parts. Avoid equal detail throughout figure. The detail hierarchy (face detailed → hands mixed → feet sketchy) must be immediately visible to the viewer.

### Airbrush Technique Anchors (≥5 required):

1. **Imperceptibly smooth gradations** – No visible steps or bands in color transitions; continuous gradation from highlight to shadow achieved through multiple light airbrush passes
2. **Frisket masking for razor-sharp edges** – Transparent mask cut precisely to create clean boundaries between color fields; costume edges, hair boundaries, prop separations all show crisp lines with zero feathering
3. **Plasticine surface quality** – Smooth, synthetic, porcelain-like finish with completely matte texture; no visible paint grain, brushstrokes, or surface irregularity
4. **Reserved white paper highlights** – Brightest highlights are untouched illustration board showing through; no white paint application
5. **Warm peach/pink skin base** – Foundation skin tone in warm peach-pink range with orange/red airbrushed shadows for dimensional modeling; cooler tones reserved for deep shadows

### Mixed Rendering Hierarchy (CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION ELEMENT):

1. **Face and torso fully rendered** – Complete airbrush modeling with high detail: facial features sharp, makeup defined (arched eyebrows, eyeliner, rouge, red lips), body volume fully realized with smooth gradations
2. **HANDS MIXED TECHNIQUE (MANDATORY)** – At least ONE hand must show visible red/orange gestural line sketches with MINIMAL or NO airbrushing; loose confident single strokes indicating fingers and palm; boneless tapered characteristic; other hand may be fully rendered. AVOID rendering both hands with equal airbrush detail.
3. **FEET PREDOMINANTLY GESTURAL (MANDATORY)** – BOTH feet must show primarily linear red/orange indication; ballet pointe shoes rendered as loose sketched outlines with ribbon indication only; heels as gestural line work; MINIMAL volume modeling; NO fully airbrushed feet. This is non-negotiable.
4. **Props selectively detailed** – Hero props (telephone, industrial machinery) fully rendered with metallic reflections and precise detail; secondary props gestural line completion
5. **Hair flattened with sharp edges** – Hair rendered with frisket-masked boundaries creating graphic flat shapes; avoid volumetric modeling or soft edges; streamlined silhouette prioritized over dimensional realism

### Pose Anchors:

1. **Dynamic diagonal body thrust** – 47% of compositions use angled torso creating diagonal energy across frame; alternative: vertical elongated stance emphasizing leg length
2. **Head tilt 10-25 degrees** – Slight angle adds playfulness; avoid rigid frontal positioning
3. **Hip-shoulder counter-rotation** – Torso twist creates S-curve silhouette enhancing streamlined aesthetic
4. **Weight distribution asymmetric** – One leg bears weight, other extended for maximum leg line display; or both legs extended in airborne ballet leap
5. **Arms extended or raised** – Hands interact with props, telephone, or positioned overhead/behind head; avoid arms hanging straight down

### Scale Hierarchy Anchor:

1. **Proportional measurements intentionally distorted** – Head 60-70% realistic size, legs 150-180% realistic length, torso 120-140% realistic length, neck 110-120% realistic length; maintain these ratios precisely for authentic Petty aesthetic

### Material Authenticity Anchor:

1. **Authentic airbrush characteristics** – No digital blur filters, no soft brush tools, no gradient mesh effects; surface must exhibit period airbrush application: smooth but not digital, matte but not flat, with subtle tonal variation from multiple light passes suggesting layered technique

### Period Consistency Anchor:

1. **1930s-1940s offset lithography reproduction** – Slight color registration drift, visible paper texture (cream/off-white magazine stock), period halftone dot pattern in shadows, non-archival aging effects (subtle yellowing, potential foxing spots)

### Canvas Adaptation Anchor:

1. **Composition optimized for 2:3 portrait ratio** – Figure placement maximizes vertical leg line within portrait format; head in upper 20%, legs extending to lower 10%; horizontal centering with minimal headroom

### Visual Hierarchy Verification:

When viewing the completed illustration, the rendering detail progression should be immediately apparent: highly detailed face/torso → visible gestural line work in at least one hand → predominantly sketch-line feet with minimal volume. If all elements appear equally rendered, the result is inauthentic.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions
## 5) Fashion & Attire – Wardrobe Matrix + Prop Selector

### Wardrobe Tracks (Adult Feminine):

**Primary Costume Categories:**

- **One-Piece Swimsuits**: Form-fitting period swimwear with modest coverage, high-cut legs, decorative elements like bows or stars; colors: saturated blues, coral pink, teal, red
- **Playsuits/Rompers**: Short shorts with wrap tops, halter tops, or crop tops; bows, ties, decorative closures; colors: pink, white with contrasting accents
- **Athletic/Sportswear**: High-waisted short sets, crop tops, athletic-inspired pieces; minimal decoration
- **Theatrical Costumes**: Seasonal themes (witch for Halloween, matador/toreador, etc.); dramatic costume elements integrated
- **Formal Gowns**: Floor-length flowing fabric, elegant silhouettes; colors: white, cream, pastels; for bridal or evening themes
- **Workwear**: Short overalls with crop tops, caps, work gloves; paired with industrial prop themes

### Fabric Behavior:

- **Flat color application** – Costumes rendered in saturated solid colors with minimal internal shading; fabric folds indicated by sharp value changes rather than gradual modeling
- **Streamlined drape** – Fabric follows body curves smoothly; avoid heavy wrinkles or complex folds
- **Period-accurate construction** – 1930s-1940s swimwear, playsuit, and sportswear silhouettes with historically appropriate cuts and closures

### Accessory Caps: Minimalist (0-2)

**Footwear Options:**

- **Ballet pointe shoes**: Preserve unbroken leg line; rendered as gestural line work with ribbon indication; colors: pale pink, white, costume-coordinated
- **Period heels**: Peep-toe, sling-back, platform styles; loose sketched outlines; coordinated with costume
- **Casual flats**: Minimal detail, gestural indication only

**Hat Options:** Wide-brimmed sun hat, cap with decorative element, visor, theatrical costume hat (witch, toreador, etc.)

**Glove Options:** Long evening gloves (white, cream), work gloves (yellow/cream) – only when thematically appropriate

**Jewelry:** Minimal to none; occasional bracelet or anklet as delicate line indication only

### Color Palette Restrictions:

- **Primary costume colors:** Saturated blue, coral/salmon pink, red, white, teal, mint green
- **Accent colors:** Orange, yellow, brown, black for contrast elements
- **Avoid:** Muddy colors, earth tones (except for specific costume themes), neon brights, excessive pattern

### Wardrobe Variation Required:

Change primary costume colors and styles between iterations; cycle through period-appropriate palette and costume categories avoiding identical repetition.

### Props (Maximum 1 Hero Prop):

**Hero Prop Options:**

- Vintage rotary dial telephone (signature Petty motif)
- Industrial machinery (Ridge Tool Company equipment with metallic finishes)
- Seasonal thematic elements (broomstick for witch, bouquet for bride, etc.)
- Oversized decorative objects (integrated with composition)

**Prop Rendering:** Hero props fully rendered with attention to form, shadows, and material quality (metallic reflections, etc.); secondary elements gestural line completion only

**Prop Scale:** Often oversized relative to figure for visual impact and composition

### Coherence Filter:

All costume and prop elements must support 1930s-1940s Depression-era sophisticated fantasy aesthetic; avoid wholesome patriotic Americana; fallback = clean minimal scene with swimsuit or playsuit.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns
## 7) Composition & Background

### Ratio-Specific Composition (2:3 Portrait):

- **Vertical emphasis mandatory** – Figure elongation emphasized by portrait format
- **Subject dominance 75-90%** – Figure occupies overwhelming majority of composition height
- **Hierarchical staging** – Head in upper 20%, torso in middle 50%, legs extending to lower 10% (or beyond frame for maximum elongation effect)
- **Minimal headroom** – Tight cropping at top to maximize leg line display

### Style-Specific Composition:

- **Perspective regime:** Flattened space with no environmental depth; figure isolated against void
- **Grid/symmetry:** Horizontal centering typical; vertical asymmetry through pose dynamics
- **Figure:ground ratio:** 80:20 (figure 80%, background 20%)
- **Density:** High detail in face and torso (60% of figure), minimal detail in extremities (40% of figure)
- **Lighting logic:** Diffused overhead lighting with soft shadows; avoid hard directional light or dramatic chiaroscuro
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** Concentrated detail in upper body, expansive white negative space surrounding figure optimized for 2:3 ratio

### Required Anchors:

**Surface Context Anchor:** Illustration board (original artwork); magazine paper stock (reproduced version) – specify magazine printing on period paper with visible texture

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT ENTIRELY – No frames, borders, or decorative bands outside canvas edge; Petty Girl exists in void

**Production Context Anchor:** 1930s-1940s offset lithography on wartime magazine paper stock (lighter weight, cream/off-white color, potential aging effects); period printing limitations include slight color registration drift, visible halftone dot pattern in shadows, non-archival paper yellowing

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for 2:3 portrait ratio with vertical elongation emphasis; figure placement, pose selection, and background treatment all optimized for magazine page format

### Background Treatment:

**Primary:** Stark white reserved paper – no paint application, pure void surrounding figure

**Secondary:** Flat pastel color field – subtle airbrush application in mint green, pale pink, cream, or teal; no gradation or atmospheric effects

**Tertiary:** Minimal drop shadow – soft airbrushed shadow beneath figure in cool gray or complementary tone

**Prohibited:** Complex environments, landscapes, architectural elements, furniture (except as hero prop), realistic settings, multiple light sources
