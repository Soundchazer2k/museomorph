# CLASSIC AMERICAN PIN-UP CALENDAR ART (1932-1950s)

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**CONSTRAINT PRECEDENCE:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.

**CANVAS OVERRIDE MANDATE:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.

**STYLE OVER LIKENESS:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.

**TECHNICAL MEASUREMENT AUTHORITY:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language.

**PROCESS-OVER-RESULT PRIORITY:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions.

**FACE-TREATMENT FLAGS (choose one):**

- **For Ballantyne (Oil):** `oil-fat-over-lean` or `alla-prima-direct`
- **For Moran & Mozert (Pastel):** `pastel-matte-velvety` or `pastel-particle-diffusion`

**POSE FLAGS (choose one):**

- **Ballantyne:** `candid-motion`, `gestural-fluid`, `narrative-surprise`
- **Moran:** `power-stance`, `frontal-rigid`, `glamour-direct-gaze`
- **Mozert:** `contrapposto`, `composed-elegant`, `self-aware-natural`

**CANVAS CONTROL FLAGS:** `strict-reframe` (for calendar format)

**QUANTIFIERS AUTHORITATIVE:** Numeric anchors are targets.

**TEXT POLICY:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes.

**SAFETY/IP:** No nudity; modest attire appropriate to 1940s-1950s fashion standards only; no real logos/watermarks/artist signatures - create original work without copying actual artist marks.

**AGE & WARDROBE GUARDRAIL:** All subjects adult (21+); modest attire respecting 1940s-50s calendar standards appropriate to era and publication context.

**GENDER EXPRESSION:** Respect presented gender expression.

**MATERIAL AUTHENTICITY:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics with measurable specifications.

**PERIOD PRODUCTION AUTHENTICITY:** 1930s-1950s offset color lithography with period-appropriate printing limitations - halftone dots, registration drift, paper texture, ink characteristics authentic to era.

**COMPOSITION BOUNDARIES:** No frames outside canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits beyond the artwork itself.

**FAILURE MODE FLAGS:** Avoid modern digital smoothing, HDR effects, contemporary fashion, anachronistic props, anime drift, Instagram aesthetics.

**SILENT VALIDATION:** Apply all framework requirements; regenerate silently if validation fails any checkpoint.

------

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate
### 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 portrait ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Redraw in **[Select Artist: Joyce Ballantyne | Earl Moran | Zoë Mozert] Mid-Century American Pin-Up Illustration** for **Brown & Bigelow/Shaw-Barton calendar print format**.

Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression - NOT photographic likeness.

**IP SAFEGUARD DECLARATION:** Original character design avoiding copyrighted costume elements, logos, or trademarked symbols. Create distinct visual identity appropriate to 1940s-1950s American commercial illustration.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** [Declare based on artist selection]

**Pose Flag:** [Declare based on artist selection and scenario]

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance:** The aesthetic conventions of mid-century pin-up calendar art completely override contemporary beauty standards, modern fashion, or photographic realism. This is commercial illustration serving the optimistic aspirations of post-war American consumer culture.

**Mode Selector:** Calendar art - single-image format designed for mass reproduction via offset lithography.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control
### 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (classical portrait - standard calendar page format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely for vertical portrait emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure positioned center-to-slightly-off-center, occupying 65-85% of frame depending on artist
- **Background Treatment:** Simplified environmental context supporting figure without competing for attention
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio was industry standard for frame-ready calendar art, considered "visually comfortable" for home/office display

------

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making
### 4) Technical Execution (≥5 anchors + measurement specifications)

**ARTIST-SPECIFIC TECHNICAL ANCHORS:**

#### **BALLANTYNE (Oil on Canvas):**

1. **Brushwork & Surface:** Fat-over-lean glazing producing smooth, luminous transitions in flesh tones; visible canvas texture in thinner paint areas; seamless gradations without visible individual strokes in finished areas
2. **Color Mixing Method:** Warm palette dominance with optical mixing in shadows (glazed layers creating depth); bright, optimistic saturation levels; flesh tones built from Naples yellow, cadmium red light, yellow ochre, white base
3. **Edge Treatment:** Soft transitions between figure and background; sharper definition in focal areas (eyes, expressive hands); background edges deliberately loose
4. **Detail Hierarchy:** 70% attention to expressive face and gesture-communicating hands; 20% to narrative props; 10% to environmental context; clothing rendered with selective precision supporting story
5. **Pose Execution:** Dynamic diagonal compositions suggesting arrested motion; twisted torso angles 15-30 degrees from frontal; expressive facial acting with wide eyes, surprised mouth, raised eyebrows
6. **Scale Hierarchy:** Natural athletic proportions: 7.5-8 head heights, shoulders 1.5× head width, minimal waist compression, realistic limb proportions
7. **Lighting Logic:** Warm environmental lighting (color temp 3200-3800K equivalent) from implied domestic sources; soft ambient fill creating approachable mood; minimal dramatic shadows

#### **MORAN (Pastel on Paper):**

1. **Surface Texture:** Matte, velvety finish from light-scattering pastel particles; visible paper tooth in highlights; layered pigment creating depth without waxy buildup; no glossy reflections
2. **Stroke Economy:** Confident, directional strokes defining form; minimal blending except in flesh tone transitions; background often loosely indicated with bold marks; pastel dust creating atmospheric softness
3. **Chiaroscuro Measurement:** Key light creating 60-80% value contrast between highlight and core shadow; specular highlights on skin indicating strong single-source illumination; rim lighting defining edges against dark grounds
4. **Detail Hierarchy:** 80% attention to dramatically lit figure form; 15% to high-chroma garment rendering; 5% to minimal background suggestion; light and shadow define form more than linear detail
5. **Pose Execution:** Direct confident glamour poses; direct frontal or 3/4 view; weight distribution creating elegant s-curves; confident body positioning for maximum form definition through light
6. **Scale Hierarchy:** Systematic idealization: leg length 120-130% natural proportion (measured from hip to floor), limb diameter reduced 15-20%, waist compression 15-20%, neck elongation 110-115%
7. **Lighting Logic:** Strong key light positioned 30-45 degrees from frontal creating photography-studio modeling; dark backgrounds (50-70% canvas) emphasizing illuminated figure; minimal fill light preserving dramatic shadows

#### **MOZERT (Pastel on Paper/Board):**

1. **Surface Texture:** Soft, blended pastel finish with subtle paper tooth; consistent matte quality; realistic fabric rendering showing period-accurate materials; gentle gradations without harsh transitions
2. **Stroke Economy:** Refined blending technique creating smooth forms; visible pastel strokes in looser background areas; careful color layering for naturalistic skin tones; controlled pigment application
3. **Anatomical Consistency:** Same model proportions across all works: 7.5 head-height figure, consistent facial structure, natural limb ratios, realistic joint articulation informed by self-modeling methodology
4. **Detail Hierarchy:** 65% attention to naturalistically rendered figure; 25% to graceful pose and realistic drapery; 10% to harmonious background gradations; emphasis on achievable beauty
5. **Pose Execution:** Graceful, self-contained compositions; natural body mechanics from self-modeled poses; weight distribution creating elegant lines without strain; achievable joint angles; introspective rather than performer quality
6. **Scale Hierarchy:** Realistic proportions with minimal idealization; natural limb lengths; authentic athletic-feminine build; consistent anatomy reflecting single model reference
7. **Lighting Logic:** Soft, even studio illumination (equivalent to diffused daylight or multiple-source setup); warm-to-neutral color temperature; minimal dramatic shadows; approachable, flattering light quality

**MATERIAL PHYSICS AUTHORITY:**

- **Oil (Ballantyne):** Slow-drying allows seamless blending; glazing creates optical depth; canvas prep affects absorption
- **Pastel (Moran/Mozert):** Immediate color impact; particle structure creates matte surface; paper tooth holds pigment; layering requires care to avoid waxy buildup

**CANVAS ADAPTATION ANCHOR:** All elements optimized for 3:4 vertical emphasis; figure positioned for portrait-format hierarchy
