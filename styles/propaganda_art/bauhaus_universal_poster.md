  Bauhaus designers stripped posters to pure function: grid systems, primary
  colors, modular type, and sans-serif clarity. They treated communication as an
  assembly line. We honor that rational elegance while drafting new lessons and
  wayfinding systems.

## Bauhaus Graphic Design Style (1919-1933)

### Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Face-Treatment Flags:**

- `geometric-reduction` - Pure geometric form reduction
- `functional-clarity` - Essential structural elements only
- `grid-systematic` - Modular geometric construction
- `universal-rational` - Objective rational design

**Pose Flags:**

- `geometric-fundamental` - Reduced to essential geometric forms
- `functional-positioning` - Rational structural arrangement
- `grid-aligned` - Systematic modular placement
- `universal-human` - Archetypal human proportions

**Canvas Control:** `format-native` for rational grid systems

------
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **1:1.414 ratio** (A-series proportion, √2) - ignore source dimensions.

Redraw in **Bauhaus graphic design style (1919-1933)** for **functional geometric rational communication**.

- **Timeframe:** Bauhaus school period (1919-1933), peak rational design 1923-1928
- **Degree of likeness:** Geometrically reduced to essential rational forms; emphasis on universal design principles
- **Emotional tone:** Rationally objective, functionally clear, universally accessible, geometrically precise
- **Pose conventions:** Grid-aligned geometric positioning; functional clarity; rational structural arrangement

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original Bauhaus-inspired rational design avoiding specific school projects.

**Style Dominance:** Functional geometry and rational reduction override representational detail.

**Mode Selector:** Educational/institutional poster for universal rational communication.

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `1:1.414` (DIN A-series proportion based on √2 - fundamental Bauhaus ratio)

**RECOMPOSITION:**

- **Reframing Method:** Rational grid-based recomposition with geometric reduction
- **Spatial Allocation:** Modular grid system with functional zones
- **Background Treatment:** Primary color geometry with grid structure
- **Format Justification:** √2 proportion allows infinite subdivision while maintaining ratio - fundamental Bauhaus principle

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** De Stijl, Russian Constructivism, geometric abstraction, functional design theory, universal communication principles

**Medium/Production:** Clean offset printing with geometric precision; primary colors only; grid-based layout; 120-150 LPI screen. Surface exhibits rational mechanical perfection.

**Thematic purpose:** Design education and rational communication; promote universal design principles; functional aesthetics serving social purpose; eliminate ornament in favor of function.

**Hallmark motifs:**

1. Primary color palette: Red, blue, yellow with black and white (Mondrian influence)
2. Geometric reduction to circle, square, triangle fundamental forms (40-60% composition)
3. Grid-based modular construction with √2 proportional relationships
4. Sans-serif typography integrated as geometric element (30-40% composition)
5. Functional clarity with minimal ornamentation (95% reduction from decorative)

**Period framing:** Weimar Germany 1919-1933, Bauhaus school workshops, functional design education.

**Tone Tag:** Rationally-precise, functionally-clear, geometrically-fundamental, universally-accessible

**Production Era Authenticity:** Clean mechanical printing with perfect registration; primary ink colors unmixed; geometric precision within 0.5mm tolerance.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work:** Geometric precision using ruler/compass only; 1-3mm consistent thickness; perpendicular/parallel grid alignment; fundamental geometric forms

**Geometric Reduction:** Faces reduced to circle/square/triangle combinations; bodies simplified to rectangular planes; total reduction 80% from naturalistic

**Color Application:** Primary colors only (red=Pantone 485, blue=286, yellow=109); black and white; 100% flat solid coverage; no gradients or mixing

**Grid Construction:** Modular grid based on √2 proportions; all elements aligned to grid intersections; systematic rational placement

**Detail Hierarchy:** Maximum reduction - faces 20% detail (geometric symbols), bodies 30% (rectangular forms), background 90% geometric abstraction

**Surface Texture:** Mechanical perfection - no hand variation; crisp edges; geometric precision; rational surface treatment

**Pose Anchors:** Grid-aligned positioning; geometric angular relationships; rational structural balance; universal proportions

**Scale Hierarchy:** Equal weight to all geometric elements; democratic visual distribution; functional clarity 100%

------
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks:**

- Functional worker: Geometric reduction to rectangular forms; primary color blocks
- Bauhaus student: Simplified geometric clothing; functional work attire reduced to essential forms

**Fabric behavior:** Eliminated - reduced to flat geometric color planes

**Accessory caps:** Minimalist 0-1 - only if serving functional purpose

**Color palette:** 70% primary colors (red/blue/yellow), 20% black, 10% white

**Props (≤1):**

- Only if functionally necessary: geometric tools (compass, ruler, T-square) reduced to symbolic forms

```yaml
bauhaus_props:
  design_tools: [compass_symbol, ruler_line, square_angle, circle_form]
  geometric: [triangle, circle, square, rectangle]
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**⛔ Canvas Negatives:**

- "decorative ornament", "naturalistic detail", "emotional expression", "historical reference"
- "complex gradients", "mixed colors", "organic curves", "asymmetrical chaos"
- "individual personality", "cultural specificity", "artistic subjectivity", "representational accuracy"

**✅ Canvas Positives:**

- "geometric reduction", "functional clarity", "primary colors only", "grid-based rational"
- "universal principles", "modular construction", "systematic design", "objective communication"
- "circle square triangle", "perpendicular parallel", "√2 proportions", "mechanical precision"

------
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**BAUHAUS COMPOSITION:**

- Perspective: Eliminated - pure frontal geometric planes
- Grid: Strict modular grid based on √2 proportions; all elements grid-aligned
- Figure:ground: 50:50 democratic balance; positive/negative equal importance
- Density: 60-70% coverage with rational breathing room
- Lighting: Eliminated - flat geometric planes with primary colors
- Detail hierarchy: Maximum reduction to geometric fundamentals - 80-90% abstraction

**BACKGROUND TREATMENT:**

- Primary color blocks: Large geometric rectangles in red/blue/yellow
- Grid structure: Visible or implied √2 modular system
- Geometric forms: Circle/square/triangle fundamental shapes
- Rational space: Functional negative space as important as positive

**SURFACE CONTEXT:** Bauhaus school wall, workshop, educational institution - designed for universal rational comprehension

------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Typography ESSENTIAL for Bauhaus rational communication**

**LAYOUT:**

- Grid-aligned text zones following √2 proportions
- Horizontal/vertical only - no diagonal text
- Modular typographic elements integrated with geometric forms

**Typography:**

- Clean geometric sans-serif; functional lowercase emphasis
- **Google Fonts:** Roboto (rational geometric), Source Sans Pro (functional clarity), Lato (universal accessibility)
- **Authentic reference:** Futura, Universal, geometric Grotesk faces designed at Bauhaus

**Text Content:**

- Universal rational messages: "Form", "Function", "Geometry", "Rational"
- Educational/institutional content reduced to essential communication
- Avoid decorative language - pure functional information

**Production Method:** Typography as geometric element equal to shapes; grid-aligned; primary color treatments; rational mechanical precision
