about: >
  Constructivists sliced photo fragments and red wedges into megaphones for the
  revolution. Bold diagonals, sans-serif slogans, and offset litho grain turned
  industry into message. We channel that 1920s shock while speaking to new
  causes without reviving state emblems.

## Soviet Constructivism (1915-1930s)

### Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.

**Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.

**Face-Treatment Flags:**

- `geometric-faceted` - Angular reduction to geometric planes
- `photomontage-collage` - Photographic fragments with graphic overlay
- `diagonal-dynamic` - Extreme angles, radical perspectives
- `constructivist-industrial` - Machine-age precision

**Pose Flags:**

- `diagonal-revolutionary` - Dynamic 45-degree angles
- `heroic-worker` - Monumental labor positioning
- `photographic-crop` - Extreme close-up fragmentation
- `geometric-abstraction` - Reduced to essential forms

**Canvas Control Flags:**

- `strict-reframe` for poster formats
- `adaptive-extend` for spatial compositions

**Media Hybrid Flag:**

- `photo-geometric-overlay` - Photomontage with typography integration

**Material Physics Authority:** Offset lithography with photomechanical reproduction **Technical Measurement Authority:** Diagonal compositions 30-60°, photographic scale 150-300% enlargement **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Photomontage cutting and layering technique supersedes seamless appearance **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Deliberately uncomfortable diagonal viewing angles authorized

------
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (standard Soviet poster format) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Redraw in **Soviet Constructivist agitprop poster style (1919-1930)** for **lithographic offset printing with photomontage**.

- **Timeframe:** Revolutionary propaganda period (1919-1930), peak avant-garde 1922-1928
- **Degree of likeness:** Geometrically abstracted through photomontage; emphasis on revolutionary dynamism over individual features
- **Emotional tone:** Revolutionarily urgent, industrially optimistic, dynamically propagandistic, geometrically modern
- **Pose conventions:** Diagonal revolutionary poses at 30-60° angles; extreme photographic cropping; heroic upward gazes; industrial tool interaction

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original constructivist design avoiding Soviet state emblems or specific historical figures; create abstract revolutionary worker archetype.

**Style Dominance:** Constructivist geometric abstraction and photomontage technique override photographic naturalism.

**Mode Selector:** Agitprop poster for mass public mobilization.

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (Soviet standard poster format 50x70cm / 20x28in)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Strict vertical recomposition with diagonal emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned on dynamic diagonal axis, typically lower-left to upper-right
- **Background Treatment:** Geometric shapes (circles, triangles, lines) in bold red/black/white
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 vertical allows heroic monumentality while maintaining street poster readability

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Russian avant-garde (Suprematism, Futurism), industrial design aesthetics, photomechanical reproduction, revolutionary agitation

**Medium/Production method:** Offset lithographic printing with photomontage technique - photographs mechanically cut and layered with geometric shapes and bold sans-serif typography. Surface exhibits halftone dot patterns at 85-133 LPI (lines per inch). Ink application: 1.5-2mm wet film thickness.

**Thematic purpose:** Revolutionary mass mobilization through visual shock and geometric clarity; merge art with industrial production; communicate Party directives to semi-literate masses.

**Hallmark motifs:**

1. Diagonal compositions at 30-60° angles creating dynamic tension
2. Photographic elements cropped to 150-300% scale emphasizing monumentality
3. Bold geometric shapes (red wedges, black circles, dynamic lines) at 40-60% canvas coverage
4. Sans-serif Cyrillic typography integrated as design element (30-40% of composition)
5. Limited color palette: 85% red/black/white, 15% yellow accents

**Period framing:** Revolutionary Russia 1919-1930, peak Constructivist agitprop 1922-1928 before Socialist Realist suppression.

**Tone Tag:** Revolutionary-urgent, geometrically-precise, photographically-shocking, industrially-optimistic

**Production Era Authenticity:** Offset lithography with visible registration marks; slight color misalignment 0.5-1mm; paper texture shows 120-150gsm newsprint absorption.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work:** Geometric precision with ruler/compass; diagonal emphasis 30-60°; bold contours 3-5mm thickness separating photographic and geometric elements

**Photomontage Construction:** Photographic fragments cut with precision blades; layered with 2-3mm overlap; mechanical enlargement 150-300% creating grain enhancement; sharp edge transitions between photo/graphic

**Color Application:** Flat areas 95% solid coverage; red (Pantone 185C equivalent); black 100% density; white paper stock showing through; maximum 3 colors per poster

**Typography Integration:** Sans-serif geometric fonts (constructivist style); letterforms 25-50% of composition height; diagonal/vertical text orientation; tight letter spacing 0-5% tracking

**Detail Hierarchy:** Photographic faces/hands rendered 80% detail; geometric shapes 100% flat; typography 100% legible from 3m distance; minimal atmospheric depth

**Surface Texture:** Offset lithography exhibits mechanical dot patterns; slight ink spread on newsprint absorption; registration drift 0.5-1mm between colors

**Pose Anchors:** Head tilt 15-30° creating diagonal; shoulders rotated 20-40° from frontal; one arm raised 45-60° upward; heroic gaze 10-15° above horizon

**Scale Hierarchy:** Central figure 60-70% canvas height; geometric shapes 40-50% coverage; typography 20-30% integrated; background 10-20% negative space

**Material Authenticity:** Authentic photomontage cutting technique with visible edges; mechanical halftone reproduction; authentic offset printing characteristics

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks:**

- Worker masculine: Industrial coveralls, worker's caps, tool belts, heavy boots
- Revolutionary feminine: Headscarves, simple dresses, industrial aprons, sturdy footwear
- Military/political: Red Army uniforms, leather jackets, revolutionary caps with red stars

**Fabric behavior:** Heavy cotton drill (coveralls), wool serge (uniforms), cotton prints (dresses) - all rendered with geometric simplification, minimal drapery detail

**Accessory caps:** Minimalist 1-2 items - industrial tools (hammers, wrenches), revolutionary symbols (red banners, books), military elements (rifles, caps)

**Color palette:** 70% black/dark grey garments, 20% white/cream shirts, 10% red accents (scarves, banners, stars)

**Wardrobe variation:** Alternate between worker industrial, revolutionary activist, military defender - maintain period 1920s Soviet authenticity

**Props (≤2):**

- Hero prop: Industrial tool (hammer, sickle, wrench) OR revolutionary symbol (red flag, book)
- Micro prop: Worker's cap OR revolutionary badge

**YAML prop pools:**

```yaml
constructivist_props:
  industrial: [hammer, sickle, wrench, drill, machinery]
  revolutionary: [red_flag, book, newspaper, megaphone]
  military: [rifle, bayonet, red_star_cap]
```

------
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**2:3 PORTRAIT COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

- Vertical emphasis with diagonal revolutionary movement
- Subject dominance 60-70% with geometric overlay
- Hierarchical staging: foreground photographic figure, midground geometric shapes, background typography

**CONSTRUCTIVIST COMPOSITION:**

- Perspective: Extreme angles - worm's eye view or bird's eye view creating 30-60° diagonals
- Grid/asymmetry: Dynamic diagonal axis breaking classical balance
- Figure:ground: 60:40 ratio - bold positive/negative space contrast
- Density: 70-80% coverage with geometric/photographic elements
- Lighting: High contrast 90% black/white with minimal midtones; directional suggesting industrial spotlights
- Detail hierarchy: Face/hands 80% detail, body 60%, background 30% geometric abstraction

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context:** Street poster, factory wall, propaganda kiosk - designed for 3-5m viewing distance
- **Frame/Band:** Omit entirely - Constructivist aesthetic rejects bourgeois framing
- **Production Context:** Offset lithographic newsprint, halftone dot pattern visible, slight registration drift

**BACKGROUND TREATMENT:**

- Geometric shapes: Red wedges (40-60° angles), black circles (20-30% canvas), dynamic lines (2-5mm thickness)
- Typography: Cyrillic sans-serif integrated as compositional element (25-40% coverage)
- Industrial motifs: Simplified factory silhouettes, mechanical gears (geometric reduction)
- Color blocks: 85% red/black/white flat areas, 15% yellow accent wedges

------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Typography MANDATORY for Soviet Constructivist style**

**RATIO-APPROPRIATE ZONES:**

- Upper 25%: Revolutionary slogan (Cyrillic sans-serif, 15-20% canvas height)
- Diagonal overlay: Dynamic text following 45° compositional axis
- Lower 20%: Publishing information (smaller 5-8% canvas height)

**Copy limits:** 3-5 words main slogan; 10-15 words secondary text **Maximum 2 text elements:** Primary revolutionary message + publishing credit

**Period-Appropriate Typography:**

- Geometric sans-serif Cyrillic fonts: blocky, industrial, constructed letterforms
- **Closest Google Fonts:** Oswald Bold (geometric industrial), Bebas Neue (condensed power), Roboto Black (constructivist clarity)
- **Authentic reference:** Constructivist custom lettering - angular, geometric, hand-constructed

**Historical accuracy:** Typography integrated as equal design element with geometry and photography; text follows diagonal dynamics; letterforms simplified to geometric essentials

**Production Method Integration:** Typography rendered with slight halftone texture; registration offset 0.5mm from photographic elements; ink saturation 95-100%

**Text Content Guidelines (if authorized):**

- Russian revolutionary vocabulary: "ВПЕРЕД" (Forward), "РАБОЧИЙ" (Worker), "КНИГИ" (Books)
- Avoid specific historical slogans - create abstract revolutionary messaging
- Typography as geometric shape - meaning secondary to visual impact
