  WPA artists married simplified realism, human warmth, and bold typography to
  sell literacy, parks, and public health. Silkscreen flats, hand-cut stencils,
  and friendly palettes felt optimistic. We keep that civic lift while inventing

## American WPA Style (1935-1943)

### Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Face-Treatment Flags:**

- `silkscreen-simplified` - Bold flat color areas
- `democratic-accessible` - Clear readable features
- `poster-graphic` - Strong silhouette emphasis
- `social-realist-lite` - Dignified worker portrayal

**Pose Flags:**

- `democratic-dignity` - Upright confident stance
- `american-labor` - Working class pride positioning
- `community-service` - Engaged civic participation
- `hopeful-forward` - Optimistic future-facing

**Canvas Control:** `strict-reframe` for poster formats **Media Hybrid:** `silkscreen-multilayer` - Sequential color layer application

**Material Physics Authority:** Silkscreen printing with 3-6 color separations **Technical Measurement:** 45-65 LPI screen mesh; 2-3mm ink deposit per layer **Process-Over-Result:** Hand-pulled screen registration supersedes perfect alignment

------
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (standard WPA poster format) - ignore source image dimensions.

Redraw in **American WPA Federal Art Project poster style (1935-1943)** for **silkscreen printing with social realist accessibility**.

- **Timeframe:** New Deal relief art period (1935-1943), peak production 1938-1941
- **Degree of likeness:** Simplified accessible dignity; emphasis on democratic American character
- **Emotional tone:** Optimistically hopeful, democratically dignified, communally engaged, nationally proud
- **Pose conventions:** Upright working poses; engaged eye contact; tools of trade; forward-looking determination

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original New Deal-inspired worker imagery avoiding specific WPA projects or historical figures; create representative American worker archetype.

**Style Dominance:** Silkscreen graphic simplification and democratic accessibility override photographic detail.

**Mode Selector:** Public service poster for community education and national morale.

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (standard poster format compatible with silkscreen frames)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION:**

- **Reframing Method:** Vertical recomposition emphasizing central figure with clear messaging zones
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject centered 50-60%, balanced hierarchical composition
- **Background Treatment:** Simplified American landscapes or work environments with 3-5 color flats
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 allows maximum readability for public spaces - community centers, post offices, libraries

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** American Scene painting, European modernist posters, social realism, Bauhaus simplification adapted for democratic messaging

**Medium/Production:** Hand-pulled silkscreen printing on poster stock - each color requires separate screen; 3-6 color maximum; registration tolerance ±2mm. Surface shows mesh texture at 45-65 LPI. Ink deposit 2-3mm creating slight relief.

**Thematic purpose:** Public education and morale building during Depression; promote New Deal programs; celebrate American worker dignity; accessible democratic communication.

**Hallmark motifs:**

1. Simplified human figures with clear readable features (40-50% detail reduction from photo)
2. Bold flat color areas with 90-95% solid coverage in 3-6 hue maximum
3. Strong silhouette emphasis with 3-5mm outline borders
4. Geometric backgrounds suggesting American landscapes/industry (30-40% abstraction)
5. Clear sans-serif typography integrated with imagery (20-30% composition)

**Period framing:** New Deal America 1935-1943, post offices and community centers, democratic art for the people.

**Tone Tag:** Optimistically-accessible, democratically-dignified, clearly-communicative, nationally-unifying

**Production Era Authenticity:** Hand-pulled silkscreen shows slight registration drift; ink bleeds 0.5-1mm at color boundaries; paper stock 150-200gsm with visible texture

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work:** Bold simplified contours 2-4mm thickness; minimal interior detail; strong silhouette emphasis; geometric reduction of natural forms

**Color Separation:** 3-6 distinct hues; flat 90-95% coverage per color; registration tolerance ±2mm creating slight overlap/gap; transparent overprints create additional hues

**Silkscreen Technique:** Mesh texture visible at 45-65 LPI; ink deposit 2-3mm thickness creating tactile surface; hand-pulled pressure variations show 5-10% density fluctuation

**Typography:** Bold sans-serif letterforms; 15-25% of composition; clear hierarchy; typically 1-2 typefaces maximum; high contrast color relationships

**Detail Hierarchy:** Faces simplified 50% from photographic; hands/gesture 60% readable; clothing 70% abstracted; background 80% geometric reduction

**Surface Texture:** Paper texture shows through in light colors; ink sits on surface with slight sheen; registration marks visible at edges; occasional color bleed 0.5-1mm

**Pose Anchors:** Shoulders square and level ±5°; spine upright with civic pride; arms engaged in meaningful gesture or labor; eye contact direct and confident

**Scale Hierarchy:** Central figure 50-60% canvas; supporting elements 20-30%; background 15-20%; typography 20-30% integrated

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks:**

- Worker masculine: Denim overalls, flannel shirts, work boots, caps or fedoras
- Worker feminine: Simple cotton dresses, practical aprons, sensible shoes, headscarves
- Middle-class: Clean suits, modest dresses, professional attire suggesting white-collar work

**Fabric behavior:** Simplified drapery with 3-4 main folds maximum; solid color blocks; minimal texture indication

**Accessory caps:** Minimalist 1-2 - tools of trade (hammer, brush, book), American symbols (flag element, eagle)

**Color palette:** Patriotic emphasis - 30% blues, 25% reds, 20% earth tones, 15% white/cream, 10% green/yellow accents

**Props (≤2):**

- Hero: Tool of trade (hammer, typewriter, book, brush) OR American symbol
- Micro: Hat, tool, small patriotic element

```yaml
wpa_props:
  labor_tools: [hammer, wrench, paintbrush, typewriter, book]
  american_symbols: [flag_element, eagle, liberty_bell, capitol]
  community: [school_book, health_poster, park_tree]
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**⛔ Canvas Negatives:**

- "complex gradients", "photographic detail", "individual portraiture", "elite sophistication"
- "partisan politics", "foreign influence", "abstract expressionism", "commercial advertising"
- "dark pessimism", "class division", "racial exclusion", "decorative excess"

**✅ Canvas Positives:**

- "clear simplified forms", "democratic accessibility", "optimistic forward-looking", "American dignity"
- "bold flat colors", "readable silhouettes", "community service", "national unity"
- "working class pride", "public education", "silkscreen texture", "hand-pulled authenticity"

------
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**WPA COMPOSITION:**

- Perspective: Eye-level democratic viewpoint; 0-15° slight heroic angle; accessible human scale
- Grid: Centered bilateral symmetry or balanced asymmetry; stable horizontal/vertical emphasis
- Figure:ground: 55:45 balanced relationship; clear positive/negative space
- Density: 60-70% coverage; breathing room for clarity
- Lighting: Clear directional suggesting optimistic daylight; 70% highlight/30% shadow simplified
- Detail hierarchy: Face 60% simplified, hands 70% readable, environment 40% abstracted

**BACKGROUND TREATMENT:**

- American landscapes: Simplified fields, factories, cities with 3-5 color flats
- Work environments: Geometric reduction of tools, machinery, public buildings
- Patriotic elements: Abstracted flags, eagles, stars - integrated not dominant (10-15%)
- Color zones: Large flat areas with clear boundaries; minimal texture

**SURFACE CONTEXT:** Community center wall, post office, library, school - designed for 2-4m viewing distance in public spaces

------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Typography ESSENTIAL for WPA poster communication**

**LAYOUT ZONES:**

- Upper 20%: Title/slogan (bold sans-serif, 12-18% canvas height)
- Lower 25%: Program information, dates, locations (8-12% height)
- Optional side columns: Supporting information vertically aligned

**Copy limits:** 2-4 words main title; 10-20 words supporting text; ≤7 total text elements

**Typography:**

- Democratic sans-serif fonts: accessible, sturdy, clearly readable
- **Google Fonts:** Roboto Bold (accessible clarity), Open Sans Bold (democratic friendliness), Source Sans Pro Black (confident communication)
- **Authentic reference:** Franklin Gothic, News Gothic - American industrial sans-serifs

**Text Content:**

- Public service messaging: "Work", "Learn", "Grow", "Serve"
- Community programs: health, education, recreation, employment
- Avoid political slogans - focus on civic engagement and national unity
