## Art Deco Propaganda Style (1925-1945)

### Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Face-Treatment Flags:**

- `geometric-streamlined` - Angular Art Deco reduction
- `metallic-sophisticated` - Chrome and gold effects
- `deco-stylized` - Elegant elongation and curves
- `luxury-modern` - Sophisticated machine-age aesthetic

**Pose Flags:**

- `streamlined-dynamic` - Sleek forward movement
- `geometric-precision` - Angular sophisticated positioning
- `modern-confident` - Progressive technological optimism
- `luxury-assured` - Elite modern sophistication

**Canvas Control:** `strict-reframe` for poster elegance **Media Hybrid:** `lithograph-metallic` - Metallic inks and geometric precision

------
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (Art Deco poster standard) - ignore source dimensions.

Redraw in **Art Deco propaganda poster style (1925-1945)** for **lithographic printing with geometric sophistication**.

- **Timeframe:** Machine Age Art Deco (1925-1945), peak 1930-1940
- **Degree of likeness:** Geometrically streamlined elegance; emphasis on modern sophistication
- **Emotional tone:** Modernly sophisticated, progressively optimistic, technologically confident, luxuriously efficient
- **Pose conventions:** Streamlined forward poses; geometric angular positioning; sophisticated modern gestures

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original Art Deco design avoiding specific corporate logos or brand identities.

**Style Dominance:** Geometric sophistication and streamlined modernism override naturalistic detail.

**Mode Selector:** Corporate/institutional propaganda promoting modern progress and technological advancement.

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (elegant Art Deco poster proportions)

**RECOMPOSITION:**

- **Reframing Method:** Sophisticated vertical with geometric streamlined emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned with Art Deco geometric framing 50-60%
- **Background Treatment:** Geometric patterns, metallic effects, streamlined moderne elements
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 allows elegant vertical sophistication for corporate/travel posters

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** French decorative arts, Cubism, Futurism, ancient Egyptian/Aztec motifs, machine age streamlining, luxury ocean liner design

**Medium/Production:** High-quality lithographic printing with metallic inks (gold, silver, bronze); 6-8 color separations; 150-200 LPI fine screen; coated paper stock 200-300gsm. Surface exhibits sophisticated dot patterns with metallic sheen effects.

**Thematic purpose:** Corporate propaganda promoting modern progress, technological advancement, luxury consumption, streamlined efficiency; visualize machine age optimism and sophisticated modernity.

**Hallmark motifs:**

1. Geometric streamlining with chevron patterns and stepped forms (30-40% of design)
2. Metallic color palette: gold, silver, chrome effects (25-35% coverage)
3. Sunburst/radiating patterns suggesting progress and energy (20-30% background)
4. Elongated elegant figures with stylized proportions (20% height elongation)
5. Zigzag/chevron borders and decorative geometric frames (15-20% composition)

**Period framing:** Machine Age 1925-1945, corporate headquarters, travel bureaus, world's fairs, luxury venues.

**Tone Tag:** Sophisticatedly-modern, geometrically-elegant, technologically-optimistic, luxuriously-progressive

**Production Era Authenticity:** Fine lithographic printing with metallic ink overlay; registration precision ±0.5mm; paper shows slight texture under metallic areas.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work:** Precise geometric contours 1-2mm thickness; Art Deco chevron and stepped patterns; streamlined curves with compass precision

**Geometric Stylization:** Figures elongated 15-20% with angular shoulders; faces simplified to elegant geometric planes; Art Deco sunburst and zigzag patterns integrated

**Color Application:** Sophisticated palette with metallic accents - gold (Pantone 871), silver (877), bronze (874); jewel tones - emerald, sapphire, ruby; black and cream base

**Metallic Effects:** Gold/silver/chrome rendered with graduated tones suggesting reflective surfaces; 3-layer printing for metallic depth

**Detail Hierarchy:** Geometric reduction to essential elegant forms; faces 50% stylized with Art Deco planes; clothing shows streamlined folds; backgrounds 70% geometric pattern

**Surface Texture:** Fine lithographic halftone; metallic inks create slight relief 1-2mm; coated paper shows smooth sophisticated finish

**Pose Anchors:** Elongated vertical stance; angular shoulder positioning; streamlined gestures following geometric curves; sophisticated modern confidence

**Scale Hierarchy:** Central figure 50-60% with geometric framing; decorative borders 20-30%; background patterns 15-25%

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks:**

- Modern masculine: Streamlined suits, geometric ties, slicked hair, polished shoes
- Sophisticated feminine: Bias-cut gowns, cloche hats, geometric jewelry, elegant drape
- Corporate/travel: Professional modern attire with Art Deco accessories

**Fabric behavior:** Bias-cut draping with geometric folds; metallic lamé effects; streamlined moderne simplification

**Accessory caps:** 2-3 sophisticated items - geometric jewelry, modern hats, streamlined accessories

**Color palette:** 40% metallic gold/silver/bronze, 30% jewel tones, 20% black/cream, 10% accent colors

**Props (≤2):**

- Hero: Modern technology (telephone, automobile element, airplane) OR Art Deco decorative object
- Micro: Geometric jewelry OR modern accessory

```yaml
art_deco_props:
  modern_tech: [telephone, radio, automobile, airplane, skyscraper]
  luxury: [geometric_jewelry, crystal, chrome_object, moderne_vase]
