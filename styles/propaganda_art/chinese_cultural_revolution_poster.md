about: >
  Cultural Revolution posters glow with socialist realism: sunlit reds, smiling
  masses, and heroic Maoist iconography. Brush-drawn figures were then printed
  in huge runs. We echo that fervor while crafting new allegories free of actual
  party slogans.

## Chinese Cultural Revolution Style (1966-1976)

### Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Face-Treatment Flags:**

- `heroic-idealized` - Romanticized revolutionary features
- `collective-typical` - Generic rather than individual
- `poster-simplified` - Bold readable from distance
- `political-symbolic` - Every element carries meaning

**Pose Flags:**

- `revolutionary-determination` - Fist raised, forward lean
- `collective-unity` - Group solidarity positioning
- `red-book-wielding` - Mao's quotations interaction
- `socialist-construction` - Active labor participation

**Canvas Control:** `strict-reframe` for poster mass production **Media Hybrid:** `offset-color-registration` - Period-appropriate printing limitations

**Material Physics Authority:** Offset lithography with 4-color process limitations **Revolutionary Authorization:** Comfort-violation authorized for political intensity

------
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (standard Chinese poster format) - ignore source dimensions.

Redraw in **Chinese Cultural Revolution propaganda poster style (1966-1976)** for **offset lithographic printing with political symbolism**.

- **Timeframe:** Cultural Revolution propaganda period (1966-1976), peak intensity 1967-1970
- **Degree of likeness:** Heroically idealized revolutionary type; emphasis on collective determination over individual identity
- **Emotional tone:** Revolutionarily fervent, collectively determined, politically mobilizing, socialistically triumphant
- **Pose conventions:** Revolutionary fist raised 45-60°; red book prominent; forward-leaning action; collective grouping

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original Cultural Revolution-inspired imagery avoiding specific historical figures or events; create archetypal revolutionary worker/peasant/soldier.

**Style Dominance:** Political symbolism and heroic idealization override naturalistic representation.

**Mode Selector:** Revolutionary mobilization poster for mass political education.

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (standard Chinese propaganda poster format)

**RECOMPOSITION:**

- **Reframing Method:** Dynamic vertical with revolutionary upward movement
- **Spatial Allocation:** Hero figures 50-70% with revolutionary symbols integrated
- **Background Treatment:** Sunrise/industrial/agricultural landscape in symbolic colors
- **Format Justification:** Vertical heroic monumentality for public display in communes, factories, schools

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Soviet Socialist Realism (1950s training), traditional Chinese nianhua (New Year prints), Mao's artistic directives, German Expressionist woodcuts (1930s leftist influence)

**Medium/Production:** Offset lithographic printing with 4-color process; registration tolerance ±1.5mm; paper stock 120-180gsm with slight texture. Surface shows characteristic dot patterns and color registration artifacts.

**Thematic purpose:** Political mobilization for Cultural Revolution; promote Mao Zedong thought; visualize Party directives; inspire revolutionary action; attack "Four Olds" (old customs, culture, habits, ideas).

**Hallmark motifs:**

1. Heroic figures 150-200% idealized proportions with revolutionary determination
2. Red dominant palette (50-60% coverage) with yellow/orange sunrise symbolism
3. Mao's Little Red Book prominent (15-20% of composition when present)
4. Revolutionary gestures: raised fists, pointed fingers, triumphant poses
5. Symbolic backgrounds: sunrise (revolution), factories (industry), fields (agriculture)

**Period framing:** Maoist China 1966-1976, commune halls, factory walls, school classrooms, mass rally posters.

**Tone Tag:** Revolutionarily-militant, collectively-heroic, politically-symbolic, socialistically-triumphant

**Production Era Authenticity:** Period offset printing shows 4-color registration drift; dot gain 8-12%; slight color shifts from ink mixing variations.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work:** Bold contours 2-4mm thickness; minimal interior modeling; emphasis on clear readable silhouettes from distance

**Heroic Idealization:** Figures enlarged 150-200% with perfect proportions; faces simplified to 40% detail showing revolutionary determination; muscles defined but not anatomically precise

**Color Application:** Dominant red 50-60% coverage (symbolizing revolution); yellow/orange 20-30% (sunrise/glory); blue 10-15% (industry/sky); green 5-10% (agriculture)

**Political Symbolism:** Every element carries meaning - sunrise (revolution dawning), red books (Mao thought), raised fists (struggle), pointing fingers (direction), industrial/agricultural backgrounds (socialist construction)

**Detail Hierarchy:** Faces show revolutionary expression 60%; hands/gestures 80% prominent; clothing 50% simplified with symbolic colors; background 30% symbolic reduction

**Surface Texture:** Offset lithography shows halftone rosette patterns; slight color registration misalignment ±1.5mm; ink saturation varies 85-95%

**Pose Anchors:** Body leaning forward 15-25° showing revolutionary momentum; one arm raised 45-60° in triumph; red book held prominently; collective grouping 2-5 figures

**Scale Hierarchy:** Central revolutionary figures 60-70%; symbolic elements (red books, flags) 20-30%; background symbolism 15-20%

------
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks:**

- Revolutionary worker: Blue/grey Mao suits, worker's caps, simple cotton clothing
- Peasant revolutionary: Traditional cotton pants, simple jackets, headscarves for women
- Red Guard youth: Military-style uniforms, red armbands, revolutionary insignia

**Fabric behavior:** Simplified with minimal folds; solid color blocks; revolutionary red accents on collars, sleeves, armbands

**Accessory caps:** 1-2 revolutionary items - red armbands mandatory, red books, revolutionary badges

**Color palette:** 60% revolutionary red, 20% worker blue/grey, 15% peasant earth tones, 5% symbolic yellow/white

**Props (≤2):**

- Hero: Mao's Little Red Book OR revolutionary tool (hammer, sickle, rifle)
- Micro: Red armband OR revolutionary badge

```yaml
cultural_revolution_props:
  political: [red_book, red_flag, mao_badge, red_armband]
  labor: [hammer, sickle, farming_tool, industrial_tool]
  militant: [rifle, revolutionary_banner, struggle_poster]
```

- "heroic idealization", "revolutionary determination", "collective unity", "socialist realism"
- "political symbolism", "red dominant palette", "sunrise backgrounds", "forward momentum"
- "raised fists", "pointed directions", "triumphant poses", "mass mobilization"

------
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**CULTURAL REVOLUTION COMPOSITION:**

- Perspective: Heroic low angle 15-30° looking up at revolutionary figures; suggests monumentality and inspiration
- Grid: Dynamic diagonal emphasis suggesting revolutionary movement; asymmetrical power compositions
- Figure:ground: 65:35 ratio - bold positive space dominance
- Density: 75-85% coverage - intense visual saturation
- Lighting: Symbolic rather than naturalistic - sunrise glow, revolutionary red radiance
- Detail hierarchy: Faces/hands/gestures 70% prominent; clothing 50%; background 40% symbolic

**BACKGROUND TREATMENT:**

- Revolutionary sunrise: Red/orange/yellow gradients 40-50% of background
- Industrial landscapes: Simplified factories, smokestacks, machinery in heroic scale
- Agricultural fields: Golden wheat, collective farms, tractors suggesting abundance
- Urban construction: Building projects, scaffolding, socialist modernization
- Color symbolism: Red (revolution), yellow (glory), blue (industry), green (agriculture)

**SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS:**

- Sun/sunrise: Revolution dawning (20-30% sky area)
- Red flags: Revolutionary spirit (10-15% composition)
- Industrial/agricultural: Socialist construction (30-40% background)
- Collective crowds: Mass support (optional 20-30% background)

------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Typography ESSENTIAL for political messaging**

**LAYOUT:**

- Upper 25%: Revolutionary slogan (bold sans-serif, 15-20% canvas height)
- Lower 20%: Secondary messaging or publication info
- Side columns: Supporting quotations from Mao (optional vertical text)

**Copy limits:** 3-6 words main slogan; 10-20 words secondary text; maximum 3 text zones

**Typography:**

- Bold revolutionary fonts suggesting strength and determination

- **Authentic reference:** Bold simplified Chinese characters with strong geometric structure

**Text Content:**

- Revolutionary slogans avoiding specific historical references
- Generic mobilization: "Serve the People", "Revolution", "Unity and Strength"
- Avoid Cultural Revolution-specific slogans - create archetypal revolutionary messaging

**Production Method:** Typography shows slight halftone texture; registration offset from imagery ±1mm; red ink dominant with black outline
