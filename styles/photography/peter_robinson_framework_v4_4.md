about: >
  Peter Robinson (1948–2024) was a British sports photojournalist whose five-decade
  career with The Guardian elevated sports photography to fine art. Inspired by
  Henri Cartier-Bresson's decisive moment theory, Robinson created emotionally
  resonant black-and-white images emphasizing human drama, athletic struggle, and
  compositional precision. His commitment to B&W film (Kodak Tri-X, Ilford HP5 Plus)
  in the color era established his unique artistic voice. Working with Nikon SLRs
  and telephoto lenses (300–600mm), he mastered darkroom techniques—dodging, burning,
  tonal control—to achieve museum-grade prints from dynamic sporting moments. This
  framework captures his late-career aesthetic across three operational modes.

# Universal Museum-Grade Framework v4.4
## Peter Robinson — Sports Photojournalism

---

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint Precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.

**Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.

**NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement:** Generate images with EXACT aspect ratio of declared target (3:2, 4:3, or 16:9). Do not default to non-standard ratios.

**Critical Flags (Mandatory):** `film-grain-visible`, `soft-edge-transitions`, `telephoto-compression`, `tonal-contrast-high`, `decisively-composed`

**Mode Isolation:** Each mode (A/B/C) maintains distinct technique ecosystem. Mode A techniques (tight isolation, extreme bokeh) DO NOT apply to Mode B (balanced framing, visible context).

**Material Physics Authority:** B&W film signature (Kodak Tri-X/Ilford HP5 Plus characteristic grain, shadow floor ≈1, highlight ceiling ≈253) overrides aesthetic preferences.

**Quantifiers Authoritative:** All numeric targets (grain variance, tonal ranges, pose angles, background density percentages) are validation criteria.

**Period Production Authenticity:** Film-era darkroom methods (dodging, burning, paper selection) evident in output; no digital smoothing or modern post-processing filters.

**Composition Boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; no watermarks, credits, or artificial presentation borders.

**Silent Validation:** Apply checklist internally; regenerate if failing criteria.

**STRICT TERMINATION:** Framework ends at Section 8. No commentary beyond.

---

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:2**, **4:3**, or **16:9** aspect ratio (select primary mode at generation). Ignore source image dimensions completely.

**RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of selected target. This is a hard requirement—no deviation to non-standard outputs.

**Style Dominance:** Redraw in **Black & White Film Photography — Sports Photojournalism (1968–2011 aesthetic)** for **newspaper print publication context with archival fine art quality**.

**Identity via:** Silhouette (body posture), gesture (athletic action), expression (emotional intensity). Recognize athlete through recognizable sporting context and distinctive pose.

**Gender Expression Mandate:** Preserve subject's presented gender identity through period-appropriate athletic styling (1968–2011 sporting uniforms, equipment). Male athletes maintain masculine presentation across all modes; female athletes maintain feminine presentation across all modes.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original athlete designs with authentic period sporting context; avoid recognizable real-world jerseys, logos, or trademarked equipment.

**CRITICAL FLAGS (Declare all):**
- `film-grain-visible` — Kodak Tri-X/Ilford HP5 Plus characteristic grain structure
- `soft-edge-transitions` — Telephoto bokeh with smooth falloff
- `telephoto-compression` — Subject isolation via ~300–600mm equivalent perspective
- `tonal-contrast-high` — Full spectrum B&W (shadow floor ≈1, highlight ceiling ≈253)
- `decisively-composed` — Peak moment capture; Cartier-Bresson influence

**Face-Treatment Flag:** Mode-dependent
  - **Mode A:** `face-emotional-intensity` — Peak action often excludes readable facial detail; emotion encoded in body language
  - **Mode B:** `face-readable-context` — Visible face within sporting action
  - **Mode C:** `face-candid-vulnerability` — In-between moment often reveals unguarded emotional state

**Pose Flag:** Mode-dependent
  - **Mode A:** `pose-extreme-dynamic` — Peak athletic moment (jumping, stretching, explosive movement)
  - **Mode B:** `pose-mid-action` — Transitional or sustained athletic posture
  - **Mode C:** `pose-candid-vulnerability` — Rest moment, in-between gesture, emotional exposure

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` — Reframe subject to center/isolate within target ratio, maintaining telephoto compression perspective.

**Mode Selector (Choose one):**
- **Mode A:** Peak-Action Isolation — Subject isolation 70–85% frame, extreme dynamic gesture, heavily blurred background
- **Mode B:** Environmental Context — Subject isolation 50–65% frame, balanced rule-of-thirds framing, venue/context visible
- **Mode C:** Candid Transition Moment — Subject isolation 40–60% frame, intimate scale, off-center framing permitted, emotional vulnerability

---

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**Primary Ratio Selection (NanoBanana Native):**
- **3:2** (1.50 ratio) — Classic 35mm SLR negative; Robinson's primary newspaper print ratio
- **4:3** (1.33 ratio) — Editorial standard; tighter horizontal constraint; secondary choice
- **16:9** (1.78 ratio) — Modern digital/screen distribution; widest landscape format

**Ratio Authenticity Justification:**
Robinson worked primarily with Nikon F-series SLRs shooting 35mm film (native 3:2 ratio). Newspaper editors cropped to 4:3 for column/page layouts. Digital archiving uses 16:9. All three ratios authenticated within corpus (90% landscape, mean AR 1.48, range 0.80–1.78).

**Renderer Compatibility Check:** All three ratios supported by NanoBanana natively. No adaptation required.

**Recomposition Strategy:** When generating for selected ratio, maintain telephoto perspective and subject isolation, adjust background density per mode (Mode A: heavy blur; Mode B: 35–45% context visible; Mode C: 30–40% context).

**Spatial Allocation Logic:**
- **Subject placement:** Rule-of-thirds primary (65% of corpus); off-center permitted in Mode C
- **Background treatment:** Mode-dependent blur (see Section 7)
- **Depth layering:** 2–3 atmospheric layers via telephoto compression

**Format Justification:** 3:2 enforces landscape orientation consistent with Robinson's newspaper career; subject isolation achieved via ratio width. 4:3 tightens composition; 16:9 allows maximum environmental context (Mode B).

**Mode-Specific Ratio Considerations:**
- **Mode A:** 3:2 preferred (tight isolation), 16:9 acceptable
- **Mode B:** 4:3 or 16:9 optimal (room for context)
- **Mode C:** 3:2 permits intimate framing; 4:3 allows environmental intimacy

---

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Artistic Movement:** Black & White Documentary Sports Photography (1968–2024); decisive moment photojournalism descended from Henri Cartier-Bresson tradition.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Film-era aesthetic primacy (1968–2011); digital transition visible in later work (2011–2024) but maintaining B&W film-simulation approach. NO digital smoothing, Instagram filters, or modern post-processing visible.

**Artist Active Dates:** 1968–2024 (56-year career); framework captures mature late-career aesthetic (1995–2024).

**Material Foundation:** 
- **Primary media:** Kodak Tri-X 400 ASA and Ilford HP5 Plus B&W film; characteristic organic grain structure
- **Camera systems:** Nikon SLRs (F, F3, F4, F5; digital transition to Nikon DSLRs)
- **Lenses:** Telephoto-dominant (300mm, 400mm, 600mm); subject isolation via optical compression, not cropping
- **Darkroom/Post-processing:** Dodging, burning, contrast control, darkroom paper selection (baryta/fiber-based for exhibition prints); digital equivalent for later work

**Tone Tag:** Melancholic, dramatic, emotionally resonant; athletic struggle emphasized over triumph.

**Key Innovation (Non-Technical):** Sustained commitment to B&W monochrome despite color photography dominance; elevated sports photography from documentation to fine art.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Technical Anchor 1: Film Grain Signature (Grain Variance 837±150)**
- **Specification:** Kodak Tri-X characteristic grain visible throughout image; grain variance mean 837 (SD 150)
- **Implementation:** Render with film-era grain structure; not digital smoothing or modern sensor noise
- **Measurement:** Extract 50×50px sample crops; calculate variance; target 700–950 range
- **Validation:** Grain must appear organic (random distribution) not artificial (pattern-based)
- **Mode adjustment:** Mode A (isolated subject) = prominent grain on main figure; Mode B/C = grain uniform across frame

**Technical Anchor 2: Tonal Range & Contrast (Shadow floor ≈1, Highlight ceiling ≈253, Contrast std 62±8)**
- **Specification:** Full-spectrum B&W utilizing maximum tonal range; shadow floor near black (1–5), highlight ceiling near white (250–255)
- **Measurement:** Histogram analysis; minimum luminance value ≈1–5; maximum ≈250–255; standard deviation 62±8
- **Implementation:** Optimize darkroom techniques (dodging/burning simulation); rich midtones with distinct value zones
- **Validation:** Image exhibits 5–7 distinct tonal steps per form; no crushed shadows or blown highlights
- **Mode adjustment:** Mode A = higher contrast (cinematic drama); Mode B = balanced contrast (newspaper standard); Mode C = softer contrast (intimacy)

**Technical Anchor 3: Edge Quality & Softness (Softness coefficient 0.78±0.08)**
- **Specification:** Telephoto bokeh creates soft, smooth edge transitions; softness coefficient 0.78 (range 0.70–0.86)
- **Measurement:** Sobel edge detection + blur kernel analysis; measure transition gradient across subject-background boundary
- **Implementation:** Optical bokeh (telephoto compression) simulated via graduated blur; no hard lines
- **Validation:** Subject-background boundary exhibits 3–5mm soft transition zone; no artificial sharpening
- **Mode adjustment:** Mode A = razor-soft bokeh (isolation); Mode B = graduated transition (environment readable); Mode C = soft but quicker falloff

**Technical Anchor 4: Anatomical Pose & Subject Scale (Subject scale 40–85% frame; dynamic index 60% extreme)**
- **Specification:** Athletic figure fills 40–85% of frame depending on mode; 60% of corpus exhibits extreme dynamic pose (jumping, stretching, explosive action)
- **Measurement:** Subject bounding box as % of total image area
- **Implementation:** Mode A = 70–85% frame fill (tight isolation); Mode B = 50–65%; Mode C = 40–60%
- **Validation:** Pose remains physically plausible; gesture recognizable as athletic archetype
- **Anatomical angles:** Head-to-body ratio ~1:6–1:8 (athletic proportion); limb angles vary per sport (soccer, football, track)
- **Mode adjustment:** Mode A = peak moment (extreme angle); Mode B = mid-action sustainable pose; Mode C = transitional/at-rest pose

**Technical Anchor 5: Telephoto Perspective & Background Compression (Compression ratio 3:1 estimated)**
- **Specification:** ~300–600mm equivalent telephoto compression; minimal perspective convergence; background compressed behind subject
- **Measurement:** Visual inspection of perspective lines; subject-background spatial separation
- **Implementation:** Render with minimal depth cues; background flattened relative to wide-angle; atmospheric depth via bokeh, not linear perspective
- **Validation:** No receding lines; background appears "stacked" behind subject; no wide-angle distortion
- **Mode adjustment:** Mode A = maximum compression (isolation); Mode B = moderate compression (context partially readable); Mode C = subtle compression (intimate scale)

---

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Temporal Wardrobe Mandate (1968–2024 sporting uniforms):**
- **Primary constraint:** All clothing must predate 2024 (Robinson's death year); no post-2024 athletic technology
- **Sport-specific jerseys:** Football/soccer uniforms from 1968–2024 era; fabric weave visible; authentic branding removed (replace with generic athletic wear)
- **Prohibited anachronisms:** No modern moisture-wicking synthetic fabrics predating 1990s; no contemporary athlete tracking technology (GPS watches, HRM vests post-2000s)
- **Fabric behavior:** Natural cotton/wool jerseys (1968–1990s) exhibit different drape/wrinkle patterns than synthetic (1990s–present); render accordingly

**Eyewear Guard:** If glasses/sunglasses present, render as period-appropriate frame styles (thick plastic frames 1970s–1990s, modern sport frames 2000s+); no modern lightweight metal aerogel designs.

**Gender-Differentiated Wardrobe Tracks:**
- **Male athletes:** Traditional athletic shorts, sleeveless or short-sleeve jerseys, minimal accessory (watch, band tape)
- **Female athletes:** Period-appropriate sports bra, shorts/trackpants with leg freedom, minimal jewelry (per era norms); no anachronistic athletic leggings in 1968–1980s content

**Hair Preservation Requirements:**
- **Length:** Preserve visible length (short, medium, long) as per historical sporting era (1970s athletes typically shorter hair; 2000s+ more varied)
- **Color:** Maintain natural/athletic-realistic hair color; no artificial dyes inconsistent with era
- **Baldness/facial hair:** Preserve if visible in source context (receding hairline, beards, etc.)
- **Mode-specific hair treatment:** Mode A (peak action) = may obscure hair via motion/angle; Mode B/C = hair visible and recognizable

**Mode-Specific Wardrobe Variations:**
- **Mode A:** Peak-action context permits uniform disorder (jersey askew, shorts ridden up/down); fabric tension visible
- **Mode B:** Athletic uniform neat, recognizable sport-context (football pitch stripe visible, track venue implied)
- **Mode C:** Transition moments may show uniform adjustment (tightening straps, wiping sweat); more intimate wardrobe detail

**Props (0–2 per image, mode-appropriate):**
- **Mode A:** Ball/equipment prominent (soccer ball, rugby ball, athletic equipment defining sport)
- **Mode B:** Equipment visible (ball in play, goal posts, field marking implied); venue context props (fence, crowd blur)
- **Mode C:** Equipment optional; emotional props permitted (towel, hand gesture, introspective object)

**Prop Temporal Validation:** All props (balls, goals, field equipment) period-authentic to 1968–2024 sporting standards; no modern synthetic materials in pre-1990s context.

**Setting Authenticity:**
- **Venues:** Football pitches, track fields, stadium architecture period-appropriate (1968–2024); no modern stadium design in 1970s content
- **Crowd backdrop:** Blur permitted (Mode A/B); if identifiable, render as period-appropriate spectator clothing, hairstyles, signage
- **Environmental detail:** Stadium seats, field markings, goal structures consistent with declared era

**Wardrobe & Props Coherence Filter:** All visible elements (uniform style, fabric texture, equipment design, venue architecture, crowd fashion) must align within ±10 years of declared era (default: 1995–2024 for mature career aesthetic).

**Vocabulary Warnings (Prohibited Prompt Language):**
- ❌ "Hyper-realistic" (implies excessive detail inappropriate to film grain aesthetic)
- ❌ "Polished" or "pristine" (implies digital smoothing)
- ❌ "Instagram filter" or "modern photography" (contemporary post-processing forbidden)
- ❌ "Glamorous" or "fashion editorial" (Robinson's documentary aesthetic opposed)
- ❌ "Professional lighting" (implies studio strobes, not arena ambient/natural light)

**Technique-Specific Constraints:**
- **Dodging/Burning analogs:** Digital equivalent permitted; results must appear as selective lightening/darkening, not global curves adjustment
- **Paper selection:** Baryta fiber-based print texture implied (subtle, not obtrusive)
- **Darkroom dust/artifacts:** Minor film dust marks acceptable (authentic); major artifacts prohibited
- **Color cast:** True B&W or minimal warm cast (sepia undertone acceptable, ~RGB 104.9/100.5/91.9 acceptable; no cold/blue casts)
- **Cropping distortion:** Subject must read naturally within target ratio; no extreme crop-related distortion

---

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**Mode-Specific Composition (FOR FINAL SELECTED RATIO):**

### **Mode A: Peak-Action Isolation**
- **Target ratio:** 3:2 preferred, 16:9 acceptable
- **Compositional archetype:** Tight subject isolation; background heavily blurred
- **Subject placement:** Left-center or right-center (off-center permitted for dynamic balance); fill 70–85% frame
- **Background treatment:** Bokeh-heavy; background recognizable sport venue reduced to color/tone (crowd blur, goal blur, field suggestion only)
- **Depth staging:** 2–3 atmospheric layers; subject floating against compressed background
- **Figure-to-ground ratio:** 70% subject, 30% environment (maximum subject dominance)
- **Lighting intensity ratio:** Key-to-fill 3:1–5:1 (high contrast, cinema-like drama)
- **Detail-to-negative-space:** Minimal negative space; subject fills visual field; environment secondary
- **Framing regime:** Decisive moment peak action centered; no ambiguous cropping
- **Frame policy:** Composition contained within canvas; no spill-off edges
- **Production context:** Newspaper print publication (tight frame = impact in small column)
- **Ratio enforcement:** 3:2 = wide isolation; 16:9 = maximum horizontal isolation space

### **Mode B: Environmental Context**
- **Target ratio:** 4:3 optimal, 16:9 acceptable
- **Compositional archetype:** Balanced, rule-of-thirds; athlete integrated into sporting venue
- **Subject placement:** Rule-of-thirds grid; subject primary but venue identifiable
- **Background treatment:** Graduated blur (visible but soft); stadium seats, goal structure, crowd texture readable at distance
- **Depth staging:** 3 distinct layers; subject mid-ground, venue foreground/background both implied
- **Figure-to-ground ratio:** 50–65% subject, 35–50% environment (balanced storytelling)
- **Lighting intensity ratio:** Key-to-fill 2:1–3:1 (balanced, editorial standard)
- **Detail-to-negative-space:** Subject sharp; environment softer but contributory to narrative
- **Framing regime:** Narrative integration; where-and-what context essential to understanding
- **Frame policy:** Composition contained; venue context visible but not dominant
- **Production context:** Editorial publication (medium-size image with context caption)
- **Ratio enforcement:** 4:3 = balanced square-ish framing; 16:9 = cinematic width allowing context

### **Mode C: Candid Transition Moment**
- **Target ratio:** 3:2 or 4:3
- **Compositional archetype:** Intimate, occasionally off-center; in-between gesture emphasis
- **Subject placement:** Off-center permitted; may float slightly; 40–60% frame fill
- **Background treatment:** Moderate blur; event context suggested (spectators, field edge, goal)
- **Depth staging:** 2–3 layers; softer distinction between subject/environment
- **Figure-to-ground ratio:** 40–60% subject, 40–60% environment (intimate sharing of space)
- **Lighting intensity ratio:** Key-to-fill 1:2–3:1 (softer, more human lighting)
- **Detail-to-negative-space:** Balanced; negative space permits breathing room; emotional vulnerability readable in space
- **Framing regime:** Decisive moment in transition; anticipation or aftermath rather than peak action
- **Frame policy:** Composition may appear slightly asymmetrical; artistic freedom (Cartier-Bresson influence)
- **Production context:** Fine art exhibition (gallery-scale intimacy)
- **Ratio enforcement:** 3:2 = intimate horizontal breathing room; 4:3 = square-ish introspection

---

**Lighting Patterns (Across All Modes):**

**Key Light Direction (Per Corpus Analysis):**
- **Overhead key light:** 45% of corpus; shadows fall downward; dramatic modeling
- **Side-lit key light:** 25% of corpus; strong asymmetric shadows; dimensional drama
- **Frontal key light:** 30% of corpus; even lighting; visibility over drama

**Key Light Specification (Mode-Dependent):**
- **Mode A:** Overhead 45° or side 90° preferred (high drama, dimensional)
- **Mode B:** Frontal to side-front (editorial balance; subject readable)
- **Mode C:** Even or side-front (intimacy; emotional vulnerability accessible)

**Intensity Ratios:**
- **Mode A:** Key-to-fill 3:1–5:1 (newspaper print standard; strong shadow presence)
- **Mode B:** Key-to-fill 2:1–3:1 (balanced editorial)
- **Mode C:** Key-to-fill 1:2–3:1 (soft, human scale)

**Shadow Characteristics:**
- **Shadow floor minimum:** ≈1–5 (true black achievable)
- **Shadow edge quality:** Soft-edged (telephoto bokeh + darkroom printing)
- **Shadow readability:** Retain detail; no crushed blacks

**Highlight Treatment:**
- **Ceiling maximum:** ≈250–255 (near white, not blown)
- **Blown highlights:** Permitted if minimal (<5% frame); not in key subject areas
- **Paper-white reference:** Highlights suggest baryta fiber paper white

**Bokeh Quality & Falloff:**
- **Bokeh type:** Optical (telephoto lens characteristics), not digital softening
- **Bokeh shape:** Circular or polygonal (Nikon lens signature); natural out-of-focus rendering
- **DOF characteristic:** Shallow (telephoto + subject isolation); background compressed into 2–3 value zones
- **Transition gradient:** 3–5mm soft boundary between sharp subject and blurred background

**Flare & Optical Artifacts:**
- **Lens flare:** Present in 40% of corpus (backlit sports aesthetic); acceptable but not required
- **Halation:** Minimal; authentic film characteristic if present
- **Chromatic aberration:** None (Robinson's darkroom/digital printing corrects this)
- **Vignetting:** Minimal (Richardson's tight framing, not natural vignette)

---

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Text Policy:** NO text rendering.

Robinson's newspaper prints carried captions written by editors; the photographs themselves contain no embedded text, labels, or typography. Framework prohibits any text within image boundary.

**Rationale:** Photojournalistic purity; text belongs in publication layout, not image content.

**Exceptions:** None. No image text permitted across all modes.
