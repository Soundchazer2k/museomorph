about: >
  Helmut Newton (1920–2004) redefined fashion photography as cinematic narrative, 
  subverting conventions through hard lighting, psychological tension, and 
  power-dynamic exploration. His chiaroscuro-dramatic aesthetic—rooted in film noir—transforms 
  garments and bodies into psychological markers rather than product display. Newton's signature 
  "Big Nudes" series reimagined the body as architecture; his celebrity portraits pierce 
  psychological vulnerability; his fashion editorials embed ambiguous narratives into luxury settings. 
  This framework translates his uncompromising vision into compliant visual storytelling: 
  erotic without explicit nudity, psychological without psychological damage, provocative through 
  composition and lighting rather than content. All work honors Newton's mandate: "My work is 
  not about fashion, it's about women"—and by extension, power itself.

# Helmut Newton Framework v4.4 (NanoBanana Edition)

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**CRITICAL MANDATES (Non-negotiable):**

- **Chiaroscuro dramatic lighting:** MANDATORY. Hard key light with minimal fill. Contrast ratio 1:4 to 1:8. Never diffuse; never soft-wrap lighting. This is Newton's signature; absence = framework failure.
- **Psychological intensity over prettiness:** Hard rule. Gaze is confrontational, averted, or introspective—never flattering. Asymmetrical framing; off-center composition; compositional tension required.
- **Film stock authenticity:** Kodak Tri-X (B&W) or Ektachrome (color) grain/texture visible at 1:1 crop. Salt-and-pepper shadow texture; no contemporary digital smoothing. Gelatin silver print aesthetic: rich blacks, detailed shadows (L≥18%), preserved highlights (L≤92%).
- **Minimal retouching, preserved imperfections:** Skin texture authentic; pores visible; blemishes/scars preserved unless explicitly hidden by composition. No airbrushing; no Instagram-filter aesthetics.
- **Ratio Enforcement (NanoBanana):** Aspect ratio is hard constraint. Generate EXACTLY [DECLARED RATIO]. No letterboxing, pillarboxing, or adaptation. If mode specifies 4:5, output must be 4:5—never deviate to 3:4 or 16:9.
- **Erotic non-explicit compliance:** Strategic draping, partial anatomy framing, and compositional cropping maintain sensuality and power dynamics WITHOUT explicit nudity. Google Gemini policy compliance mandatory. Architectural close-ups of clothed/draped partial anatomy; suggestive framing; psychological tension substitutes for explicit content.
- **Gender expression authenticity:** Female subjects remain recognizably feminine; male subjects remain recognizably masculine across all modes. Cross-mode consistency required. No gender-ambiguous styling inappropriate to period (1950s-1990s photographic era).
- **No conventional beauty standards:** Comfort violation authorized. Expressions are unflinching, unsettling, or psychologically distant. Avoid flattering angles, soft edges, or warm emotional content. Newton operates in psychological discomfort.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style dominance line:** Fashion photography subordinate to psychological narrative. Garments = power markers, not product display.
- **Quantitative measurement authority:** Technical specifications (shadow floor L≥18%, contrast ratio 1:4-1:8, tonal step count 6-8 per face, film grain 8-15μ equivalent) override descriptive language.
- **Material authenticity:** No synthetic fabric characteristics; no digital post-processing mimicking traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics (film stock grain, silver halide texture, characteristic imperfections of film era 1950s-1990s).
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately uncomfortable aesthetics when historically authentic. Power imbalances, psychological asymmetry, and sensual tension expected and required.
- **Mode Isolation Mandate:** Each mode maintains distinct technique ecosystem. Fashion Editorial ≠ Celebrity Portrait ≠ Narrative/Theatrical ≠ Monumental Study. No cross-contamination.
- **Triple Redundancy on Critical Specs:** Chiaroscuro mandate, psychological intensity, minimal retouching, film grain authenticity, and Gemini compliance appear in minimum 3 sections each (Sections 1, 4, 6).

**Procedure:**
1. Select mode (Section 1)
2. Declare exact aspect ratio (Section 2)
3. Extract technical specifications for mode (Section 4)
4. Validate against safety constraints (Section 6)
5. Compose for declared ratio using mode-specific framing (Section 7)
6. Generate image
7. Self-validate: hard edges maintained? Psychological intensity present? Film grain visible? Ratio exact? Gemini compliance (no explicit nudity)? → If any FAIL, regenerate

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]** — ignore source image dimensions completely.

**RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **[X:Y]**. This is a hard requirement. No exceptions.

Redraw in **Helmut Newton's Cinematic Fashion Photography** style for **[exact mode: Fashion Editorial / Celebrity Portrait / Narrative/Theatrical / Monumental Figure Study]**.

**MANDATORY TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS (Critical Anchors):**
- **Chiaroscuro-dramatic lighting:** Hard key light 45-120° from camera. Contrast ratio 1:4 to 1:8. Minimal fill (10-20% of key intensity). Shadow floor minimum L≥18% (detail preserved, never crushed). Highlight ceiling L≤92% (slight retention, never blown). NO soft diffuse lighting. NO flattering warm glow. Film noir aesthetic mandatory.
- **Psychological intensity over beauty:** Gaze is confrontational (direct eye contact with intensity), introspective (downward/averted), or psychologically distant (unfocused/dissociative). Facial expression conveys power, vulnerability, or discomfort—never warmth or happiness. Expression authenticity required; avoid manufactured smiles.
- **Minimal retouching mandate:** Skin texture preserved; pores visible; natural blemishes, scars, texture visible unless compositionally hidden. No airbrushing. No Instagram smoothing. Authentic photographic imperfection essential.
- **Film stock authenticity:** Kodak Tri-X (B&W) salt-and-pepper grain texture visible at 1:1 crop (8-15μ grain equivalent). Ektachrome (color work) characteristic saturation and color shift preserved. Gelatin silver print aesthetic: rich, detailed blacks; warm film base in highlights; cool gray undertones in shadows. Tri-X signature non-negotiable.
- **Asymmetrical composition required:** Off-center subject placement (30-70% from frame edge). Rule-of-thirds framing (subject on intersection lines). Diagonal thrust or psychological imbalance intentional. Symmetrical framing prohibited.
- **Erotic non-explicit (Gemini Compliance):** Strategic draping on partial anatomy studies; suggestive framing on full figures; psychological tension substitutes for explicit nudity. No visible genitalia, nipples on breast, or exposed intimate areas. Architectural close-ups of clothed/draped torso, thighs, back permitted. Power dynamics and sensuality maintained through composition, lighting, and gaze—not exposure.
- **Gender expression preserved:** Subjects maintain period-appropriate gender presentation across all modes. Masculine subjects remain masculine; feminine subjects remain feminine (1950s-1990s era conventions). Cross-mode consistency required.
- **Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression:** Likeness established through body language, pose confidence, facial feature scale, and psychological intensity—not photorealistic detail.

**MODE SELECTOR (MANDATORY - Choose One):**
- **Fashion Editorial — Narrative Staging:** Product-fashion integration with psychological narrative. Garment as power marker. Studio or luxury location. High-contrast editorial framing. Typical ratio: 3:4 or 4:3.
- **Celebrity Portrait — Psychological Intensity:** Seated or standing formal portrait. Psychological vulnerability or dominance. Minimal background; spotlight focus. High-fashion styling; luxury props. Typical ratio: 4:5 or 3:4.
- **Narrative/Theatrical — Surrealist Scenarios:** Multiple figures or figure + mannequin/doll in ambiguous power dynamics. Luxury or strange setting. Props as symbolic elements. Cinematic mood. Typical ratio: 16:9 or 2:3.
- **Monumental Figure Study — Architectural Body:** Partial anatomy extreme close-up (draped/clothed torso, back, thighs). Body-as-landscape treatment. Strategic draping for Gemini compliance. Studio controlled lighting. Typical ratio: 1:1 or 4:5.

**FACE-TREATMENT FLAG (MANDATORY):**
- `film-stock-authentic` (Tri-X grain visible, silver halide texture, characteristic film era imperfections)

**POSE FLAG (MANDATORY):**
- `power-dynamics-asymmetrical` (confrontational gaze, dominance, or psychological distance; weight on one leg; shoulder-hip counter-rotation)

**CANVAS CONTROL FLAG:**
- `strict-reframe` (recompose entirely for declared ratio; no padding/letterboxing)

**STYLE DOMINANCE LINE:**
Psychological narrative dominates product display. Fashion subordinate to power dynamics and psychological tension. Chiaroscuro-dramatic lighting non-negotiable. Film noir aesthetic mandatory. Erotic tension without explicit content. Comfort violation authorized.

**FINAL RATIO CONFIRMATION:** Output must be exactly **[X:Y ratio]**, no exceptions.

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** Choose one exact specification above. All Helmut Newton work naturally fits NanoBanana's native ratios; no adaptation necessary.

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY (Mode-specific):**

### Fashion Editorial — Narrative Staging
- **Ratio Status:** Native (3:4 or 4:3 preferred for editorial magazine spreads)
- **Reframing Method:** `adaptive-extend` — extend background luxury environment to fill exact ratio; recompose garment placement for frame edges
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject 45-55% of frame; luxury environment/negative space 45-55%; compositional balance asymmetrical but not weighted
- **Background Treatment:** Luxury hotel interiors, city streets, private residences. Extend architectural elements to frame edges. Detail density 35-50% background.
- **Format Justification:** Magazine editorial spreads traditionally 3:4 (vertical) or 4:3 (landscape). This ratio serves product-narrative integration while maintaining psychological space.

### Celebrity Portrait — Psychological Intensity
- **Ratio Status:** Native (4:5 preferred for intimate framing; 3:4 alternative)
- **Reframing Method:** `strict-reframe` — recompose entire framing around face/upper body for exact ratio; minimal background
- **Spatial Allocation:** Face 40-60% of frame; upper body/hands 30-40%; background/negative space 10-30%
- **Background Treatment:** Minimal; soft-focus or solid color. Spotlight focus on subject. Detail density 10-25% background.
- **Format Justification:** Portrait-oriented ratio (4:5) creates intimacy; slight vertical elongation emphasizes facial features and psychological presence. Celebrity portraits thrive in this framing.

### Narrative/Theatrical — Surrealist Scenarios
- **Ratio Status:** Native (16:9 or 2:3 preferred for cinematic/narrative spread)
- **Reframing Method:** `adaptive-extend` — extend narrative elements, props, secondary figures to fill exact ratio; maintain compositional tension
- **Spatial Allocation:** Primary subject 30-50%; secondary figures/mannequins 20-40%; environment/props 20-40%; dynamic interplay across full frame
- **Background Treatment:** Luxury or surreal setting. Props integrated into spatial composition. Detail density 45-65% background.
- **Format Justification:** Widescreen (16:9) or vertical (2:3) creates cinematic feel. Multiple subjects, mannequins, symbolic props require spatial breathing room. Narrative unfolds across extended frame.

### Monumental Figure Study — Architectural Body
- **Ratio Status:** Native (1:1 or 4:5 preferred for intimate close-ups)
- **Reframing Method:** `strict-reframe` — compose entire frame around partial anatomy; extreme close-up (torso, back, thighs, partial arms). Strategic draping/fabric visible.
- **Spatial Allocation:** Partial anatomy fills 60-80% of frame; fabric/draping 15-30%; minimal negative space (5-15%)
- **Background Treatment:** Neutral or soft-focus background. Lighting emphasis on body texture, form, fabric interaction. Detail density 30-40% background.
- **Format Justification:** Square (1:1) or portrait (4:5) creates intimate, almost abstract framing. Extreme close-up treats body as landscape/architecture. Compositional intimacy maximizes psychological impact without full-figure context.

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**INFLUENCES:**
Film noir cinematography (1940s-1950s), surrealist photography (Salvador Dalí collaborations), fashion magazines (Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Elle), luxury lifestyle aesthetics, European high society, German Expressionism (early career influence), contemporary dance photography (kinetic body studies).

**MEDIUM/PRODUCTION METHOD:**
- **Primary:** 35mm film (Nikon F series cameras) — Kodak Tri-X Pan (ISO 400) black and white, fine grain, broad tonal range, high-contrast capability, pushable for dramatic effect
- **Secondary:** Medium format (Hasselblad 500 series) — larger negatives, studio work requiring detail and deliberate composition
- **Color Work:** Kodak Ektachrome or Fuji Velvia — vibrant saturation, characteristic color shift, used selectively for high-fashion editorial
- **Darkroom Process:** Gelatin silver prints, meticulous darkroom control, precise contrast curve manipulation, minimal dodging/burning (imperfections preserved), masterprinter collaboration (Michel Chabun methodology), archival quality print materials (Agfa, Ilford paper)
- **Material Physics Requirements:** Film grain, silver halide texture, characteristic imperfections of film era (scratches, dust, chemical variations), no digital post-processing. Authentic photographic surface; not digital simulacrum.

**THEMATIC PURPOSE:**
Psychological narrative embedded in fashion imagery; power dynamics exploration through body language and gaze; subversion of conventional beauty standards; erotic tension without explicit content; gender role questioning; luxury as psychological marker; vulnerability paradoxically expressed through physical power; celebrity psychology pierced through unflinching portraiture.

**HALLMARK MOTIFS (Quantified):**

1. **Chiaroscuro-Dramatic Lighting** — Contrast ratio 1:4 to 1:8; shadow floor L≥18%; hard key light 45-120° from camera; minimal fill (10-20% of key). Emulates film noir. Non-negotiable visual signature.

2. **Asymmetrical Off-Center Framing** — Subject placed 30-70% from frame edge; rule-of-thirds intersection positioning (65% of images). Diagonal thrust or psychological imbalance intentional. Compositional asymmetry 85% of work; symmetry <15%.

3. **Statuesque Proportions** — Head-to-body ratio 1:7.8 (±0.4); shoulder width 285% of head width; limb elongation +8-12% vs. standard anatomy; pose confidence angle (hip/shoulder differential) 18° (±6°). Conveys power through refined proportion, not distortion.

4. **Psychological Intensity** — Direct confrontational gaze (85% of portraits); introspective averted gaze (15%); no warmth or happiness in expression; facial features scale: eyes 12%, mouth 8%, nose 6% of head height. Discomfort intentional.

5. **Minimal Retouching, Preserved Imperfections** — Skin texture (pores, scars, blemishes) visible unless compositionally hidden; no airbrushing; authenticity privileged over flattery. Pentimenti (editing variations): precise cropping for narrative intensity, multiple takes to capture expression, alternative compositions for commissioned work.

**PERIOD FRAMING:**
Artist active 1950s–2004 (concentrated genius 1950s-1990s); major periods: Fashion boom (1950s-60s), narrative expansion (1970s), "Big Nudes" (1970s-1980s), celebrity portraiture (1980s-1990s). All specifications reflect 1950s-1990s photographic technology, film stocks, and cultural context.

**TONE TAG:**
Psychological thriller meets high fashion; film noir sensibility; erotic without explicit; power dynamics central; discomfort intentional; luxury as facade; vulnerability beneath confidence.

**PRODUCTION ERA AUTHENTICITY:**
Film stock characteristic imperfections (Tri-X salt-and-pepper grain, color film saturation/shift, contrast curves), darkroom chemistry effects (silver halide texture), printing limitations (tone range, paper finish options — glossy or semi-matte), no digital post-processing or contemporary editing techniques. Captures 1950s-1990s photographic production reality.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

### Fashion Editorial — Narrative Staging

#### Context
Commercial magazine shoots where garment becomes psychological marker rather than mere product display. Luxury setting (hotel interiors, city streets, private residences) functions as character in narrative. Model exudes confidence, power, or controlled vulnerability. Hard dramatic lighting emphasizes contours and creates psychological tension. Fashion as authority, seduction, or protection—never passive ornamentation.

#### Measurements
- **Facial architecture:** Eyes 12% of head height; eye separation 42-46% of face width; face width 28-32% of head height; mouth 8% of head height. Cheekbones defined; jawline sharp. Feature scale conveys authority, not softness.
- **Pose confidence:** Shoulder-hip differential 15-25°; weight distributed on one leg (55-45% load imbalance); head tilt 5-15° (slight, psychological distance); upper body slight twist (8-12° torso rotation). Stance exudes control.
- **Lighting geometry:** Key light 45-90° from camera (side light dominant); intensity +4 to +5 stops above shadow floor; shadow floor L≥18%; highlight ceiling L≤90%. Fill light minimal (10-15% of key intensity). Contrast ratio 1:5 to 1:7. Rim light on figure edge (40% of images) for separation.
- **Film stock:** Kodak Tri-X grain 10-12μ equivalent; tonal step count 6-8 per face; shadow saturation S=0% (pure black to dark gray); midtone neutral L=50-60%; highlight clean L=85-90%. B&W signature or Ektachrome color (if color mode: H=15-35° skin, S=35-50%, L=65-75%).
- **Garment rendering:** Fabric detail visible at 1:1; fold authenticity (gravity-based); sheen variation (0.3-0.8 depending on material); texture signature (silk smooth, linen rough, leather grain). Fabric occupies 35-50% of frame; body 40-50%; face 15-25%.
- **Background environment:** Luxury setting (hotel corridor, penthouse window, street architecture). Detail density 35-50%; atmospheric depth 2-3 layers (foreground subject, midground environment, background soft-focus). Architectural elements sharp in compositional zones; soft-focus in peripheral vision.
- **Tonal progression:** Shadow zone (L=18-35%), midtone zone (L=45-65%), highlight zone (L=80-92%). Smooth gradation; no posterization. Six to eight distinct value steps per major form.

#### Technique
- **Pose direction:** Stand with weight on back leg (55% load). Shoulders slight rotation toward key light. Head tilt 8-10° (psychological distance from camera). Direct gaze or slight down-gaze (not averted; controlled). Expression neutral to intensity (no smile).
- **Lighting setup:** Primary key light 50-70° from camera axis (Broncolor strobe or hard-light source). Secondary fill light at 30-40% of key intensity, opposite side (lifts shadows to L≥18%). Optional rim light behind subject (creates edge separation from background). All light hard (minimal diffusion); grid spots to control falloff. Shadows sharp-edged; minimal transition zone.
- **Garment positioning:** Fabric arranged to reveal body contour (shoulders, collarbone, waist definition). Folds positioned for tonal contrast against skin. Luxury materials (silk, leather, fine linen) emphasize texture. Garment color palette: neutrals (blacks, grays, whites) or high-saturation accents (reds, jewel tones). Color saturation S=40-65% (vibrant but not artificial).
- **Camera work:** 35mm Nikon F series (spontaneity, portability). Prime lens 85mm or 105mm (focal compression, flattering perspective compression without distortion). Aperture f/2.8-f/5.6 (shallow depth of field on face; background soft-focus). Shutter 1/250-1/500 (fast film, control ambient light). Shoot multiple takes (8-15 frames per pose) for expression precision. Decisive vision; relatively low frame count vs. contemporary fashion.
- **Cropping & framing:** Asymmetrical rule-of-thirds placement (subject 30-70% from frame edge). Tight cropping emphasizes psychological space. Subject often cut at frame edge (intrusive framing, intimacy). Horizon line non-centered (psychological tension). Compositional geometry serves narrative, not formality.
- **Post-darkroom:** Precise contrast curve adjustment (master printer Michel Chabun protocol). Dodging/burning minimal (imperfections preserved). Print finish: glossy or semi-matte (gelatin silver). Tone range rich blacks (L=10-15%) to clean whites (L=92-95%). Archival quality paper (Agfa, Ilford).

#### Validation
- ✓ Hard light maintained; no soft-wrap diffusion
- ✓ Contrast ratio 1:5-1:7; shadow floor L≥18%
- ✓ Film grain visible at 1:1 crop (Tri-X salt-and-pepper texture)
- ✓ Asymmetrical framing; off-center subject (30-70% from edge)
- ✓ Psychological intensity in expression (neutral or intense, never warm)
- ✓ Garment-body-environment integration (narrative, not product display)
- ✓ Facial feature scale maintained (eyes 12%, mouth 8%, nose 6% of head)
- ✓ Tonal step count 6-8 per face; smooth gradation
- ✓ Ratio exact to declaration (no deviation)
- ✓ Gemini compliance: full figure clothed; no explicit nudity

---

### Celebrity Portrait — Psychological Intensity

#### Context
High-profile portraits capturing psychological essence rather than flattering beauty. Subject seated or standing; minimal environmental context. Hard dramatic lighting sculpts facial features with unflinching honesty. Gaze confrontational, introspective, or psychologically distant—never warm. Luxury props (cigarettes, eyewear, jewelry) as psychological markers. Goal: pierce subject's public persona; reveal vulnerability or dominance beneath celebrity image.

#### Measurements
- **Facial architecture:** Eyes 12% of head height; eye separation 42-46% of face width; face width 28-32% of head height. Nose 6% of head height; mouth 8%. Cheekbones sharp; jawline defined. Skin texture preserved (pores, character lines visible).
- **Pose confidence:** Seated: spine neutral or slight forward lean (psychological engagement) or back recline (detachment); hands visible (gesture conveys power or vulnerability). Standing: weight on one leg (55-45% imbalance); slight torso twist (8-12°). Head position: level or slight tilt (5-15°). Gaze direction: direct eye contact (confrontational), downward (introspective), or unfocused (dissociative).
- **Lighting geometry:** Key light 45-90° from camera; intensity +4.5 to +5.5 stops above shadow floor; shadow floor L≥18%; highlight ceiling L≤92%. Minimal fill (5-10% of key intensity—very harsh). Contrast ratio 1:6 to 1:8 (dramatic, unflinching). Rim light on face edge (creates edge separation). Full sculptural modeling via light.
- **Film stock:** Kodak Tri-X grain 8-10μ equivalent (fine grain for facial detail); tonal step count 7-9 per face (maximum gradation for psychological nuance); shadow saturation S=0% (pure grays); midtone L=48-58%; highlight L=88-93%.
- **Upper body/clothing:** Head 25-35% of frame; shoulders/upper body 35-45%; hands/props 10-20%; background 10-20%. Luxury styling (designer clothing, fine jewelry, eyewear, cigarette holder). Fabric texture visible; pose conveys authority or vulnerability.
- **Background:** Minimal; often solid color or soft-focus bokeh (out-of-focus background elements). Detail density 5-20%. Spotlight focus on subject.
- **Props:** 1-3 maximum (cigarette, eyewear, decorative object, jewelry). Positioning serves psychological narrative. Hand gesture around prop conveys power or vulnerability.

#### Technique
- **Pose direction:** Seated (75% of portraits): upright posture (authority) or recline (detachment); hands visible on lap or around prop. Eye contact direct or downward (introspection). Standing (25%): weight on back leg; slight torso twist; head level or tilt (8-10° maximum). Expression neutral to intensity; no smile. Psychological discomfort intentional.
- **Lighting setup:** Single key light (film noir aesthetic). 55-75° from camera axis (side light); hard source (Broncolor strobe, no softbox; minimal diffusion). Secondary fill light minimal (5-10% of key—lifts shadow floor to L≥18% only). Optional rim light behind subject (creates edge separation). All light hard-edged; sharp shadow falloff. No fill bounce; harsh shadows serve psychological purpose.
- **Spatial setup:** Subject 3-6 feet from background; background out-of-focus (f/2-f/2.8 aperture depth-of-field compression). Studio environment; minimal environmental distraction. Focus priority on eyes/face plane.
- **Camera work:** 35mm Nikon F series (preferred) or medium format Hasselblad (deliberate, composed portraits). Prime lens 85mm-105mm (compression without distortion). Aperture f/2-f/2.8 (extreme shallow depth of field; background bokeh; face sharp). Shutter 1/250-1/500. Shoot 6-12 frames per expression variation (decisive; fewer frames than editorial). Priority: capture psychological expression in single take.
- **Cropping & framing:** Asymmetrical framing; subject slightly off-center (40-60% from left/right edge). Horizon line (neck/shoulder level) positioned non-centered for psychological tension. Possible tight cropping (face fills 60-75% of frame). Subject often cropped at frame edge (intrusive, intimate framing).
- **Post-darkroom:** High contrast curve (emphasizes psychological features—eye intensity, cheekbone definition, jawline sharpness). Minimal dodging/burning; imperfections preserved (character lines, scars, blemishes). Print finish glossy or semi-matte. Archival gelatin silver print.

#### Validation
- ✓ Hard light; no soft diffusion (conflict ratio 1:6-1:8)
- ✓ Shadow floor L≥18%; highlight ceiling L≤92%
- ✓ Film grain visible (Tri-X fine grain, 8-10μ)
- ✓ Tonal step count 7-9 per face (maximum psychological nuance)
- ✓ Psychological intensity in expression (confrontational, introspective, or dissociative—never warm)
- ✓ Asymmetrical off-center framing
- ✓ Upper body + face dominant (75-85% of frame)
- ✓ 1-3 props maximum; psychological integration
- ✓ Facial feature scale maintained
- ✓ Ratio exact to declaration
- ✓ Gemini compliance: clothed upper body; no explicit nudity

### Narrative/Theatrical — Surrealist Scenarios

#### Context
Cinematic tableaux embedding ambiguous narratives into fashion imagery. Multiple figures (2-3) or figure with mannequin/doll; power dynamics central (dominance, submission, partnership, voyeurism). Luxury or surreal settings function as psychological backdrop. Lighting integrated with narrative mood (sometimes multiple light sources creating spatial drama). Props symbolic (luxury goods, power markers, fetish objects). Goal: create "stills" from imagined film; psychological tension through composition and narrative ambiguity rather than individual beauty.

#### Measurements
- **Anatomical integration:** Multiple figures: primary subject 35-50% of frame; secondary figures 20-35%; mannequins/dolls 15-30%. Head-to-body ratios 1:7.5-1:8 per figure (consistent proportions across group). Pose differential: figures at different angles; power dynamics visible through spatial relationship (overlapping, mirroring, confrontation).
- **Lighting geometry (complex):** Primary key light 45-90° from camera (illuminates primary subject dramatically); secondary light 120-180° (rim light or back light on secondary figures); ambient fill minimal (maintains shadows). Overall contrast ratio 1:5 to 1:7. Shadow floor L≥18%; highlight ceiling L≤90%. Multiple light sources create spatial drama and psychological separation between figures.
- **Film stock:** Kodak Tri-X grain 10-12μ; tonal step count 7-10 (complex interplay of multiple figures and environments); shadow saturation S=0% (pure grays); midtone L=48-62%; highlight L=85-92%.
- **Environmental integration:** Setting occupies 40-65% of frame; figures 35-60%. Luxury hotel, strange apartment, surreal landscape. Atmospheric depth 3-4 layers (foreground, midground, background). Detail density 45-65%; props strategically placed (symbolic weight).
- **Compositional geometry:** Asymmetrical; diagonal energy; vortex or off-center composition common. Rule-of-thirds with psychological tension (figures interact across frame; negative space strategic). Frame often extended horizontally (16:9 or 21:9) or vertically (2:3 or 9:16) to accommodate multiple subjects.
- **Props/objects:** 3-8 objects per image (luxury goods: champagne, cigarettes, jewelry, designer objects; power markers: chairs, tables, mirrors). Symbolic weight; not random clutter.

#### Technique
- **Narrative setup:** Visualize story before shoot; define power dynamics (who dominates? who observes?). Place figures in spatial relationship that expresses narrative (overlapping, mirroring, confrontation, voyeurism). Mannequins/dolls positioned to challenge subject reality/artifice boundary.
- **Pose direction (multiple figures):** Primary subject: strong pose (contrapposto with 15-25° shoulder-hip differential); confident stance or controlled vulnerability. Secondary figures: varied poses (seated, standing, reclining) for compositional complexity. Mannequins: posed to suggest agency or passivity (depending on narrative). Gaze directions: mixed (some figures look at each other; some toward camera; some away). Psychological tension through spatial/gestural interaction.
- **Lighting setup (complex):** Primary key light 50-70° from camera (main subject). Secondary rim light 120-180° (secondary figures, edge separation). Optional tertiary back light (creates spatial layering). All lights hard (minimal diffusion). Control falloff with grids. Multiple shadows (psychological complexity). Ambient fill minimal (preserves shadow depth). Careful to avoid flat lighting; maintain psychological drama.
- **Set decoration:** Arrange props strategically within frame (luxury goods create visual narrative). Furniture positioning creates depth and spatial relationships. Lighting integrates with set (casts dramatic shadows; emphasizes certain elements). Goal: set as psychological character, not mere background.
- **Camera work:** 35mm Nikon F series (flexibility with multiple subjects) or medium format Hasselblad (detail, deliberate composition). Prime lens 50mm-85mm (natural perspective, minimal distortion). Aperture f/2.8-f/5.6 (moderate depth of field; all figures in focus; background soft-focus). Shutter 1/250-1/500. Shoot 12-20 frames per setup (more variation due to multiple subjects and compositional complexity). Anticipate spontaneous interactions between figures.
- **Cropping & framing:** Asymmetrical rule-of-thirds across entire composition (all subjects positioned on intersections or off-center). Diagonal thrust or vortex composition common. Frame extends horizontally (16:9 for panoramic spread) or vertically (2:3 for cinematic vertical narrative). Subjects often cropped at frame edge (intrusive, intimate framing despite multiple subjects).
- **Post-darkroom:** Contrast curve emphasizes spatial drama; darker shadows (L=12-20%) for psychological depth. Dodging/burning carefully applied to selectively illuminate/darken figures or areas. Print finish glossy (emphasizes dramatic contrast). Archival gelatin silver.

#### Validation
- ✓ Hard lighting; multiple light sources for spatial drama
- ✓ Contrast ratio 1:5-1:7; shadow floor L≥18%
- ✓ Film grain visible (Tri-X 10-12μ)
- ✓ Tonal step count 7-10 (complex interplay)
- ✓ Multiple figures (2-3) in power-dynamic relationship
- ✓ Mannequins/dolls permitted and integrated
- ✓ Narrative tension visible through composition/gesture
- ✓ Asymmetrical off-center framing; rule-of-thirds applied to all subjects
- ✓ Environmental detail 45-65% of frame
- ✓ 3-8 props with symbolic integration
- ✓ Ratio exact to declaration (16:9 or 2:3 preferred; others acceptable)
- ✓ Gemini compliance: figures clothed; no explicit nudity; no inappropriate mannequin content

### Monumental Figure Study — Architectural Body

#### Context
Partial anatomy extreme close-up studying body as landscape/architecture. Strategic draping maintains Gemini compliance while preserving psychological power and sensuality. Torso, back, thighs, partial arms framed as abstract sculptural form. Studio controlled lighting; no environmental context. Goal: translate Newton's "Big Nudes" vision (monumental, powerful, formidable) into non-explicit architectural study. Body reimagined as geometry; cloth as secondary character in body-fabric dialogue.

#### Measurements
- **Partial anatomy framing:** Close-up occupies 60-80% of frame; strategic fabric/draping 15-30%; negative space 5-15%. Body section options: draped torso (shoulders to waist), back (shoulder blades to sacrum), thighs (hip to knee, draped), arms (from shoulder to hand, clothed/semi-clothed). Extreme intimacy through magnification; individual body becomes landscape.
- **Anatomical scale:** Skin texture visible (pores, contours, musculature). Muscle definition or soft curves preserved authentically (no distortion; not hyperreal smoothing). Tactile presence; three-dimensional relief visible through light modeling. Body treated as sculpture; proportions elegant but honest (not idealized distortion).
- **Lighting geometry (sculptural):** Key light low-angle (45-60° from surface tangent) to emphasize form/contour through shadow. Hard light (raking light across musculature/fabric texture). Shadow floor L≥15-18% (permits deepest detail loss; shadows can be darker for architectural effect). Highlight ceiling L≤92%. Contrast ratio 1:4 to 1:6 (dramatic sculptural modeling). Rim light along body edge (separates form from background).
- **Film stock:** Kodak Tri-X grain 8-12μ (fine grain; texture detail critical); tonal step count 7-10 per body region (maximum gradation for form modeling); shadow saturation S=0% (pure grays); midtone L=48-60% (neutral); highlight L=85-92%.
- **Fabric rendering:** Strategic draping visible; fabric texture preserved. Fabric interaction with body (folds, tension, weight). Sheen variation (silk smooth, linen textured). Fabric color neutral (whites, creams, grays, blacks) or complementary accent. Fabric occupies 15-30% of frame; visible interaction with body important.
- **Background:** Neutral or very soft-focus. Detail density 5-15%. Spotlight focus on partial anatomy; background inconsequential.

#### Technique
- **Pose direction:** Lying, seated, or standing position (depending on body section framed). Body relaxed or slightly tense (psychological nuance). Strategic fabric positioning: covers intimate areas while revealing form (shoulders, back, torso line, thigh contour, arm). No visible genitalia, nipples on breast, or exposed intimate anatomy. Draping adds psychological tension (sensuality without explicit content). Head out of frame (focuses attention on body architecture, not face).
- **Lighting setup (sculptural):** Single key light at extreme angle (45-60° from surface; raking light emphasizes contour and form). Hard source (no softbox; minimal diffusion). Placement critical: light grazes body surface to emphasize musculature, fabric texture, geometric form. Minimal fill (5-10% of key; preserves shadow depth for architectural effect). Optional rim light along body edge (creates separation). Shadows sharp; fall-off gradual (permits tonal modeling).
- **Draping strategy (Gemini compliance):** Fabric positioned to cover intimate areas while preserving form recognition. Options: flowing fabric (silk sheet) draped across torso/thighs (strategic coverage, sensual texture); fitted partial garment (tank top, high-waisted pants, wrapped fabric); artistic draping (classical Greek/Roman style, modern fashion). Fabric movement/folds visible; psychological tension through implied form beneath fabric.
- **Camera work:** Medium format Hasselblad (detail, deliberate composition) or 35mm Nikon with macro lens (extreme close-up). Prime lens 50mm-85mm (macro if extreme close-up; normal focal length for body sections). Aperture f/2.8-f/5.6 (shallow depth of field; body surface sharp; background soft). Macro focus: precise focus on body texture. Shutter 1/250-1/500. Shoot 8-15 frames per position (fewer than multi-figure compositions; more deliberate).
- **Cropping & framing:** Square (1:1) or portrait (4:5) preferred for intimate magnification. Asymmetrical cropping: body element positioned off-center within extreme close-up. Partial anatomy fills frame; subject cropped at edges (body extends beyond frame). No context; just form, light, fabric, shadow.
- **Post-darkroom:** High contrast curve (emphasizes form through shadow/highlight interplay). Careful dodging/burning to selectively illuminate contours or darken shadow zones for sculptural effect. Print finish glossy (emphasizes surface texture, sheen, form modeling). Archival gelatin silver.

#### Validation
- ✓ Extreme close-up framing; partial anatomy 60-80% of frame
- ✓ Strategic draping maintains Gemini compliance (no explicit nudity)
- ✓ Hard raking light emphasizes form/contour
- ✓ Contrast ratio 1:4-1:6; shadow floor L≥15-18%
- ✓ Film grain visible (Tri-X 8-12μ)
- ✓ Tonal step count 7-10 (maximum form modeling)
- ✓ Body-fabric interaction visible; fabric texture preserved
- ✓ Minimal to no background (detail density 5-15%)
- ✓ Square (1:1) or portrait (4:5) ratio declared
- ✓ No face visible (body architecture emphasis)
- ✓ Anatomically honest (no hyperreal smoothing, no impossible distortion)
- ✓ Gemini compliance: clothed or strategically draped; no visible intimate anatomy

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**TEMPORAL WARDROBE MANDATE:**

- **Artist active period:** 1950s–2004 — ALL wardrobe elements must predate image date or reflect period fashion conventions
- **CRITICAL PROHIBITION:** No modern clothing retention from source images; no contemporary eyeglasses/sunglasses (anachronistic unless character-specific); no modern hairstyles (undercuts, fades, contemporary women's cuts)
- **Complete wardrobe replacement required:** Subjects fully redressed in period-accurate costume or timeless luxury wear; no modern elements survive transformation

**PERIOD-ACCURATE WARDROBE TRACKS:**

### Fashion Editorial — Narrative Staging

**Adult Feminine:**
- **1950s-1960s:** Tailored dresses (shift, A-line, mod silhouettes), fitted suits, designer couture (Chanel, Dior, Yves Saint Laurent), high-waisted trousers, silk blouses, cashmere sweaters. Accessories: leather gloves, silk scarves, designer handbags. Fabrics: silk, wool, linen, cotton (natural materials pre-1956). Colors: blacks, whites, jewel tones (emerald, sapphire, ruby), earth tones (camel, taupe, gray).
- **1970s:** Flared trousers, jumpsuits, tunic tops, flowing kaftans, maxi dresses, leather jackets, halter necklines. Fabrics: polyester (introduced 1960s but rare in haute couture; Newton rarely used synthetic fabrics—prioritize natural materials). Colors: burnt sienna, mustard, deep purple, chocolate brown, jewel tones. Luxury brands: YSL, Gucci, Valentino.
- **1980s-1990s:** Power suits (shoulder emphasis), slim-fit dresses, leather pants, designer jeans (Valentino, designer cuts), minimalist silhouettes. Fabrics: fine wool, silk, leather. Colors: blacks, whites, jewel accents, neutrals. Luxury: Armani, Valentino, Versace aesthetic.

**Adult Masculine (when present):**
- **1950s-1960s:** Tailored suits (fitted, narrow lapels), white dress shirts, ties (silk), leather shoes (oxfords, loafers), trench coats. Fabrics: wool suiting, fine cotton. Colors: charcoal, navy, black, white.
- **1970s:** Tailored blazers, dress shirts (often open-collared), fitted trousers, leather jackets. Fabrics: wool, silk, fine cotton. Colors: earth tones, neutrals, subtle patterns (checks, subtle stripes).
- **1980s-1990s:** Tailored jackets, designer dress shirts, designer jeans (when casual), suit precision. Fabrics: fine wool, silk. Colors: blacks, grays, whites, navy.

**Eyewear Protocol (CRITICAL):**
- Eyeglasses invented ~1286 but rare/expensive until 1700s+; mainstream 1950s+. For Newton's era (1950s-1990s): eyeglasses permitted but character-specific (intellectual, artistic, power marker). NO sunglasses unless beachwear context. NO contemporary frames (oversized, geometric, colored lenses); period-appropriate frames only (cat-eye 1950s-60s, browline 1970s, minimalist 1980s-90s).

**Fabric behavior (authentic materials):**
- **Silk:** High sheen, drapes elegantly, catches light dramatically. Wrinkles smooth. Temperature-sensitive (clings when warm, flows when cool).
- **Wool:** Structured, holds shape, textured appearance. Wrinkles set naturally. Professional appearance.
- **Linen:** Natural texture visible, wrinkles characteristic, matte finish. Cool-wearing.
- **Cotton:** Versatile, natural texture, wrinkles authentic. Mid-sheen.
- **Leather:** Structured, reflective (high contrast to light), folds with personality. Scuffs/wear visible authentically.
- NO synthetic fabric characteristics: no static cling, no athletic stretch, no modern sheen. Pre-1950s materials prioritized; post-1960 synthetics rare in haute couture (Newton avoided them).

**Temporal color palette restrictions:**
- Pre-1956: No synthetic aniline dyes (bright magentas, electric purples); natural dyes only. Colors: earth tones, jewel tones from natural pigments.
- 1950s-1990s: Full modern color palette permitted (synthetic dyes mainstream). BUT Newton preferred muted, sophisticated colors (blacks, whites, jewel tones, earth tones, grays). Avoid neon/fluorescent (inappropriate to luxury aesthetic).

**Gender-Differentiated Accessory specifications:**

**Feminine (Minimal 0-2 / Elaborate 3-4):**
- Minimal: Small handbag (leather, designer), one jewelry piece (bracelet, earring, ring). Clean, sophisticated.
- Elaborate: Handbag (luxury leather), jewelry (multiple pieces: earrings, necklace, bracelet, rings), scarf (silk), gloves (leather). Power markers.

**Masculine (when present):**
- Minimal: Watch (designer), cufflinks (subtle), tie clip. Clean lines.
- Elaborate: Luxury watch, cufflinks, tie pin, rings, handkerchief (breast pocket). Subtle power markers.

**CRITICAL PROHIBITION:** REMOVE modern accessories entirely: contemporary watches, modern jewelry styles, modern bags, tech devices. All accessories must be period-appropriate to declared era.

### Celebrity Portrait — Psychological Intensity

**Wardrobe Strategy:** High-fashion styling emphasizing luxury and psychological identity (not comfort or practicality).

**Adult Feminine (Period-specific luxury wear):**
- **1980s-1990s (primary Celebrity Portrait era):** Designer dress (Valentino, Versace, Armani), tailored jacket, luxury knitwear. Fabrics: silk, fine wool, cashmere. Colors: blacks, whites, jewel tones, neutrals with accent color.
- **Minimal clothing:** Designers prioritize silhouette and contour (psychological vulnerability or dominance depends on fit). Fitted or structured; nothing loose or obscuring body language.

**Adult Masculine (when present):**
- **1980s-1990s:** Designer suit (Armani aesthetic: fitted, elegant), dress shirt (silk), tie (silk, designer). Fabrics: fine wool, silk. Colors: blacks, grays, whites, navy.

**Accessory integration:** 1-3 pieces maximum. Examples: luxury watch, signature rings, cigarette holder, designer eyewear (character-specific), jewelry (bracelet, necklace). All accessories must serve psychological narrative (power marker, vulnerability signal, character trait). Remove modern accessories.

**Hair treatment:** Style to 1980s-1990s fashion conventions while maintaining subject's actual hair length/color. Period-appropriate styling methods (no contemporary cuts like undercuts; no modern blow-dry texture). Natural hair color preserved.

### Narrative/Theatrical — Surrealist Scenarios

**Gender-Differentiated Prop Pools:**

```yaml
narrative_theatrical_mode:
  feminine_props:
    - luxury_handbag (designer leather, Hermès-aesthetic)
    - cigarettes_holder (psychological marker, sophistication)
    - champagne_glass (luxury, celebration, intoxication)
    - jewelry (bracelet, necklace, ring—visible power marker)
    - chair_throne_like (furniture as power symbol; seated dominance)
    - mirror (self-reflection, narcissism, control)
    - silk_scarf (luxurious, sensual texture)
    - clock_timepiece (control, power over time)
    - book_manuscript (intellectual, cultural capital)
    - luxury_shoes_heels (fashion statement, dominance via height)
  
  masculine_props:
    - cigarettes (power, nonchalance)
    - luxury_watch (wealth, time control)
    - designer_suit_jacket (authority, formality)
    - rings_jewelry (power marker, subtle dominance)
    - champagne_glass (equals-based luxury, not subservient)
    - desk_or_table (territorial marker, authority)
    - manuscript_or_art (intellectual/cultural capital)
    - chair_powerful_positioning (dominance through seating)
    - car_luxury_aesthetic_only (wealth, mobility—rarely full figure)
  
  mannequin_doll_props:
    - positioned_as_secondary_character (challenge reality/artifice)
    - dressed_in_designer_wear (luxury, constructed beauty)
    - posed_in_submission_or_dominance_relationship (power dynamic)
    - often_without_face_or_obscured_face (dehumanization commentary)
  
  environmental_props:
    - luxury_hotel_interior (carpet, drapes, architectural details)
    - mirrored_surfaces (multiplication, control, narcissism)
    - architectural_details (geometry, power of space)
    - luxurious_furniture (chairs, tables, beds—as power markers)
    - windows_frames (framing within frame; voyeurism)
    - artwork_sculpture (cultural capital, sophistication)

  temporal_notes: >
    Props serve psychological narrative. Cigarettes = sophistication, control, nonchalance in 1950s-1990s 
    (anachronistic post-2000s). Luxury goods = wealth markers, power symbols. Mannequins/dolls = challenge 
    reality/artifice boundary; commentary on constructed beauty. Environmental props (furniture, architecture) 
    = psychological backdrop, power markers through spatial control. All props must be period-appropriate or 
    timeless (luxury leather goods, champagne, cigarettes remain conceptually contemporary; plastic/synthetic 
    avoided).
```

**Spatial arrangement:** Props positioned strategically; symbolic weight intentional. Props not merely decorative; each serves narrative function (power marker, vulnerability signal, psychological depth).

---

### Monumental Figure Study — Architectural Body

**Wardrobe/Draping Strategy:**

**Strategic Draping (Gemini Compliance):**
- Flowing fabric (silk, fine cotton, linen) loosely draped over partial body section (torso, thighs, back)
- Fitted undergarment (tank top, high-waisted pants, wrap) strategically positioned to cover intimate areas
- Classical Greek/Roman style draping (artistic, non-explicit)
- Fabric colors: whites, creams, grays, blacks, neutrals (emphasize body form, not compete with fabric color)
- Fabric texture visible; interaction with body important (sensuality through fabric-body relationship, not exposure)

**Prop minimalism:** 0-1 props (rarely). If present, simple objects (silk sheet, decorative cloth, minimalist furniture element). Props serve body-fabric dialogue; not distraction.

**No accessories:** This mode emphasizes body form; accessories distract. Jewelry, watches, etc., removed or out of frame.

   - Section 4: "Monumental Figure Study mode specifies strategic draping (covers intimate areas); partial anatomy framing permitted."
   - Section 6: "❌ 'Nude figure', 'explicit genitalia', 'bare breasts' → Gemini compliance mandatory. ✅ 'Erotic non-explicit', 'strategic draping'."
   - Section 7: "Compositional cropping maintains sensuality; no explicit nudity; psychological tension substitutes for exposure."

5. **Ratio Enforcement (Exact, No Deviation):**
   - Section 1: "Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of [X:Y]. This is a hard requirement. No exceptions. Output must be exactly [ratio]."
   - Section 2: "All Helmut Newton work naturally fits NanoBanana's native ratios; no adaptation necessary. MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION: Choose one exact specification."
   - Section 6: "❌ 'Original aspect ratio', '1632×640', 'non-standard ratios' → Explicit prohibition. ✅ 'MUST be [ratio]', 'strict [ratio] compliance'."
   - Section 7: "Ratio exact to declaration (no deviation); composition designed specifically for declared ratio."

**VALIDATION CHECKLIST (Background; do not add to prompt):**

- ✅ Chiaroscuro mandate: hard light, contrast ratio 1:4-1:8, shadow floor L≥18%, highlight ceiling L≤92%

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

**For Portrait Ratios (3:4, 4:5, 2:3, 9:16):**
- Vertical emphasis; subject dominance ≥70%; hierarchical staging with format-specific considerations
- Fashion Editorial (3:4): Head 20-25%, torso/garment 50-60%, lower body 15-25%, environment 15-25%
- Celebrity Portrait (4:5): Face/head 30-40%, shoulders/upper body 40-50%, background 10-20%
- Monumental Figure Study (4:5 or 2:3): Partial anatomy 60-80%, fabric 15-30%, background 5-20%

**For Landscape Ratios (4:3, 16:9, 3:2, 21:9, 5:4):**
- Horizontal flow; environmental context ≥40%; panoramic staging
- Fashion Editorial (4:3 or 3:2): Subject 50-60%, environment 40-50%; compositional balance asymmetrical but not weighted
- Narrative/Theatrical (16:9 or 21:9): Multiple subjects 35-60%, environment 40-65%, props 20-40%; dynamic interplay

**For Square (1:1):**
- Central balance (subject slightly off-center per rule-of-thirds); radial composition
- Monumental Figure Study (1:1): Partial anatomy fills frame; symmetry slight (psychological tension via asymmetry even in square)

**Adaptation Note:** All compositions optimized for FINAL aspect ratio (no adaptation required; all ratios native to NanoBanana).

---

**UNIVERSAL COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:** Photographic surface authenticity. Studio backdrop (plain, textured, or out-of-focus), location interior (luxury hotel, private apartment, city street architecture), or environmental context. All backgrounds exhibit authentic photographic depth (focus falloff, atmospheric recession). NO artificial frames, borders, or presentation frames. NO studio seamless backdrop obvious artificiality (if used, realistic lighting/shadow integration required).

**Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely. No frames, borders, or decorative bands. Pure photographic image; all context within frame boundary. No matting, mounting, or presentation edges.

**Production Context Anchor:** Gelatin silver print aesthetic. Archival quality. Rich blacks (L=10-15%), detailed shadow regions (L=18-35%), clean highlights (L=85-92%), smooth tonal gradation. Paper finish: glossy or semi-matte. No digital presentation frames; no digital watermarks or signatures. Pure photographic image.

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for declared ratio (final adapted ratio if Section 2.1 applied). Not adapted from different format. Fashion Editorial composed for editorial magazine spread (3:4 or 4:3); Celebrity Portrait for portrait framing (4:5); Narrative/Theatrical for cinematic spread (16:9); Monumental Study for intimate close-up (1:1). Each mode operates within native ratio constraints; compositional intention matched to format.

**Gender Expression Anchor:** Female subjects remain recognizably feminine; male subjects remain recognizably masculine. Cross-mode consistency required. Period-appropriate gender styling (1950s-1990s fashion conventions). No gender-ambiguous styling inappropriate to era or psychological narrative.

**Mode-Specific Composition Anchor:**

### Fashion Editorial — Narrative Staging (3:4, 4:3, 3:2)
- **Perspective regime:** One-point linear perspective (architectural environments); atmospheric recession (depth layers). Rule-of-thirds with psychological tension.
- **Grid/symmetry:** Asymmetrical; off-center subject (30-70% from frame edge). Compositional balance achieved through asymmetry (psychological weight distribution, not visual balance).
- **Figure:ground ratio:** 50% subject / 50% environment (magazine spread format); compositional interplay, not dominance hierarchy.
- **Density:** Background detail 35-50%; never empty (environment as psychological character).
- **Lighting logic:** Hard key light integrated with setting (casts dramatic shadows on walls, floor; emphasizes architectural geometry). Multiple light planes (primary on subject; ambient fill in environment). Film noir aesthetic.
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** Optimized for 3:4 or 4:3 magazine format. Rich environmental detail; negative space strategic (compositional breathing room, psychological isolation zones).

### Celebrity Portrait — Psychological Intensity (4:5, 3:4)
- **Framing regime:** Tight cropping; subject 60-75% of frame. Minimal environmental context; spotlight focus.
- **Figure positioning:** Off-center within tight frame (40-60% from left/right edge). Horizon line (neck/shoulder) non-centered (psychological tension).
- **Background focus:** Out-of-focus bokeh or neutral color. Detail density 5-20%; inconsequential background.
- **Lighting logic:** Single key light (film noir sculptor). All light hard; sharp shadow falloff. Rim light optional (edge separation).
- **Psychological depth:** Achieved through expression, gaze direction, and light modeling—not environmental context. Extreme intimacy through magnification.

### Narrative/Theatrical — Surrealist Scenarios (16:9, 2:3, 21:9)
- **Perspective regime:** Multi-point perspective; spatial complexity. Multiple subjects positioned across frame; depth through overlapping and focus falloff.
- **Compositional geometry:** Rule-of-thirds applied to all subjects (each positioned on intersection or off-center). Diagonal energy common. Vortex or spiral composition possible.
- **Figure:ground ratio:** 40% figures / 60% environment (Narrative/Theatrical prioritizes environmental context, symbolic props, power dynamics through spatial relationship).
- **Density:** Background detail 45-65%; environmental narrative rich. Props strategically positioned (symbolic weight).
- **Multiple subjects:** Positioned at different angles; power dynamics visible through spatial relationship (overlapping, confrontation, voyeurism).
- **Lighting logic:** Multiple light sources (primary key on main subject; secondary rim/back light on supporting figures). Spatial drama through selective illumination.
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** Cinematic balance; all elements serve narrative. No extraneous content; every detail intentional.

### Monumental Figure Study — Architectural Body (1:1, 4:5)
- **Extreme close-up:** Partial anatomy fills 60-80% of frame. Compositional intimacy; subject isolated from context.
- **Asymmetry in magnification:** Even in square (1:1), slight off-center positioning creates psychological tension. Body element positioned off-center within extreme close-up.
- **Background inconsequential:** Neutral or soft-focus. Detail density 5-15%; entire compositional focus on body/fabric interaction.
- **Lighting as composition:** Hard raking light (45-60° from surface) creates compositional emphasis through shadow/highlight modeling. Light becomes compositional element (shadows as much as illuminated areas).
- **Scale:** Body magnification transforms intimate detail into monumental presence. Texture and contour become landscape.

**LIGHTING PATTERNS (Mode-differentiated):**

### Fashion Editorial Lighting
- **Key light:** 50-70° from camera axis; hard source (Broncolor strobe, minimal diffusion). Intensity +4 to +5 stops above shadow floor.
- **Fill light:** 30-40% of key intensity (opposite side); lifts shadows to L≥18%. Creates dramatic yet readable lighting.
- **Rim light:** Optional (40% of images); back or side light creates figure separation from background. Hard light; sharp edge.
- **Shadows:** Sharp-edged; minimal transition zone. Shadow floor L≥18%; detail preserved. Psychological drama through contrast, not darkness.

### Celebrity Portrait Lighting
- **Key light:** 55-75° from camera axis; hard source (single light source mandatory). Intensity +4.5 to +5.5 stops above shadow floor.
- **Fill light:** Minimal (5-10% of key intensity); creates harsh shadows. Only lifts shadow floor to L≥18%.
- **Rim light:** Optional; edge separation on face/shoulders.
- **Shadows:** Very sharp; deep. Sculptural modeling of facial features. Psychological intensity through contrast extremity.

### Narrative/Theatrical Lighting
- **Primary key light:** 45-90° from camera; hard source. Illuminates primary subject dramatically.
- **Secondary light:** 120-180° from camera (rim/back light on supporting figures). Hard light; creates spatial separation.
- **Tertiary light:** Optional back light (creates spatial layering, multiple shadows, psychological complexity).
- **Ambient fill:** Minimal. Preserves shadow depth; maintains psychological drama.
- **Multiple shadows:** Expected and desired (psychological complexity through lighting interaction).

### Monumental Figure Study Lighting
- **Key light:** Low-angle (45-60° from surface tangent); hard source. Raking light emphasizes form/contour through shadow modeling.
- **Fill light:** Minimal (5-10% of key); permits deep shadows for architectural effect.
- **Rim light:** Along body edge (separates form from background). Hard light; sharp edge.
- **Shadow effect:** Shadows intentional (create sculptural modeling); darkness permits maximum tonal gradient from shadow to highlight.

**REQUIRED ANCHORS (All modes):**

1. ✅ **Surface Context Anchor:** Authentic photographic surface (no artificial frames/borders)
2. ✅ **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely
3. ✅ **Production Context Anchor:** Gelatin silver print aesthetic maintained
4. ✅ **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed for exact declared ratio
5. ✅ **Gender Expression Anchor:** Period-appropriate; cross-mode consistency
6. ✅ **Mode-Specific Composition Anchor:** Distinct framing per mode; no cross-contamination
7. ✅ **Lighting Pattern Anchor:** Mode-specific hard lighting maintained throughout

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** OMIT entirely.

Helmut Newton's work does not typically integrate typography or text within the image frame. Editorial magazine contexts involve text outside the photographic frame (in layout/design, not within photography itself). His personal projects and exhibitions are purely visual.

**Framework Mandate:** Generate clean photographic image. NO text, no typography, no visible masthead, no visible byline, no visible credits within frame.

**Exception (Theoretical):** If specific editorial context requires text overlay (e.g., magazine cover concept with masthead), contact framework author for specific guidance. Otherwise: omit text entirely.
