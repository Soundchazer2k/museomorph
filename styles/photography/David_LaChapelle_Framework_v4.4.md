about: >
  David LaChapelle (b. 1963) revolutionized celebrity photography through hyper-real theatrical staging, digitally constructed surrealist narratives, and psychological intensity. His work merges fine art conceptualism with commercial celebrity aesthetics—transcending documentary portraiture into constructed psychological spaces. His signature combines flawless skin rendering (L: 88-95% highlights), hypersat backgrounds (S: 85-100%), baroque dual-eye-reflections, renaissance volumetric face modeling, and split-complementary color theory. LaChapelle's images function as psychological documents, blending fashion editorial precision with allegorical narrative depth. All modes emphasize handcrafted theatrical environments (practical props, set design) that create metaphorical contexts for psychological portraiture.

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always recompose to declared target aspect ratio; ignore source image dimensions completely.
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement:** Aspect ratio control is prompt-based only. Model may resist ratio instructions and default to non-standard outputs. Combat through:
  - **Explicit ratio declaration** in multiple prompt locations (Section 1, Section 2, Section 6)
  - **Repetitive ratio reinforcement** using different phrasings
  - **Negative constraints** explicitly prohibiting unwanted ratios
  - **Compositional anchors** designed specifically for target ratio
- **Hyper-Real Smoothness Mandate:** Skin rendering must achieve L: 88-95% in highlight zones with zero visible texture (photographic gloss, not matte). Eye specular must show baroque dual-reflection geometry.
- **Theatrical Environment Authority:** Background density MUST occupy 60-75% of frame; environmental narrative is co-protagonist with figure.
- **Digital Post-Processing Authenticity:** All elements rendered as if digitally composited (not photographic accident)—seamless but intentionally constructed.
- **Surrealist Psychological Authority:** Authorized to generate deliberately uncomfortable, psychologically intense, or narratively bizarre imagery when historically accurate to LaChapelle's conceptual practice.
- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**
  - *Photographic Hyper-Real:* `digital-painted`, `hyperreal-smooth-skin`, `baroque-dual-reflection`, `renaissance-volumetric`
  - *Process Indicators:* `digital-composition-constructed`, `color-graded-cinema`, `studio-strobe-modeling`
  - *Material Aesthetic:* `glossy-print-finish`, `digital-c-print`, `color-surge`
- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `power-stance`, `seated-throne`, `candid-motion`, `erotic-tension`, `psychological-tension`, `contorted-psychological`, `gestural-fluid`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` (background extension mandatory for theatrical environments)
- **Surrealist Theme Authorization:** `surrealist-offset-gaze`, `psychological-attack-mode`, `allegorical-narrative`, `aesthetic-rebellion-authorized`
- **Material Physics Authority:** All elements rendered as digital post-production composite; no analog photographic accident.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("flesh L: 91%", "S: 95%", "contrast 1:6") override descriptive language.
- **Color grading authenticity:** Vivid digital color processing (not natural light); saturation and hue shifts characteristic of contemporary C-print or digital cinema processing.
- **Anatomical Proportion Validation:** Stylization forbidden; all proportions must remain anatomically sound (head-to-body 1:7.4±0.2 across all modes).
- **Gender Expression Authority:** Preserve subject's presented gender identity through period-appropriate styling. Cross-mode consistency required.
- **Mode Consistency Authority:** Subject's gender presentation and core characteristics must remain consistent across Celebrity Portrait / Tableau / Environmental modes.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid genre drift defaults (photojournalism autopilot, naturalism, documentary realism).
- **STRICT TERMINATION:** Framework ends at Section 8. DO NOT add commentary, explanations, historical context, or any content beyond Section 8.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**NANOBANANA SUPPORTED RATIOS (Native - No Adaptation Required):**

- ✅ `3:4` (portrait - 864×1184) — Celebrity glamour cover standard
- ✅ `4:5` (portrait - 896×1152) — Contemporary digital gallery portrait
- ✅ `16:9` (widescreen - 1344×768) — Cinematic tableau/environmental spread

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** Choose exactly one from above native ratios. LaChapelle's career work spans all three formats without historical specialty formats requiring adaptation.

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Ratio Status:** Native [choose native ratio above]
- **Reframing Method:** `adaptive-extend` (background extension mandatory; environmental narrative requires space)
- **Spatial Allocation (Mode-Specific):**
  - **Celebrity Portrait:** Figure 45-60% frame, faces 40-50% of portrait height, eyes positioned on rule-of-thirds intersection lines
  - **Tableau Allegory:** Multi-figure composition, primary subject 40-50%, secondary figures 15-25% each, background 65-75%
  - **Environmental Surrealism:** Figure 35-55%, environment 60-85% (surrealist staging is co-protagonist)
- **Background Treatment:** Extend theatrical, constructed, narratively-rich environments. Environmental density MUST occupy 60-75% of frame in all modes.
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 standard for celebrity magazine covers (editorial tradition); 4:5 for contemporary gallery prints (digital-era aesthetic); 16:9 for cinematic widescreen tableaus (narrative cinema influence). All ratios emphasize theatrical environmental integration.
- **Mode-Specific Ratio Considerations:**
  - **Celebrity Portrait Glamour:** 3:4 or 4:5 preferred (vertical emphasis, face dominance)
  - **Tableau Allegory:** 16:9 or 3:4 (widescreen for multi-figure; portrait for iconic single-frame allegory)
  - **Environmental Surrealism:** 16:9 preferred (panoramic staging necessary for surrealist environment)

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Andy Warhol (celebrity as subject/commodity), Peter Halley (day-glo neon in fine art), Mapplethorpe (psychological intensity), Diane Arbus (uncomfortable truths), Japanese pop sensibility, Renaissance religious iconography repurposed for contemporary celebrity.

**Medium/Production Method:** Digital post-production composite photography (1990s-present). Shot on medium-format film (Hasselblad, Mamiya RB67) or digital capture (Canon 5D series), then extensively digitally color-graded and composited in Photoshop. Final output: C-print glossy or inkjet fine art paper. **Material physics:** Hyper-real digital color grading, seamless composite construction, impossible scenarios rendered photorealistic.

**Thematic Purpose:** Psychological portraiture of celebrity; visual commentary on fame, identity, and constructed reality; allegorical narrative addressing contemporary cultural anxieties; surrealist deconstruction of self and commodity.

**3-4 Hallmark Motifs with Quantified Specifications:**

1. **Hyper-Saturated Color Fields:** Background saturation S: 85-100%, often monochromatic or split-complementary. Flesh tones (H: 20-30°) against cool backgrounds (H: 210-240°). Hex examples: Gold #FFD700, Electric Blue #0080FF, Deep Magenta #FF00FF.

2. **Dual-Eye Baroque Reflection:** Both eyes contain twin specular highlights (symmetric 45° and 315° positions), each at L: 91-95%. Renaissance-volumetric face modeling with 6-7 tonal zones creating sculptural depth.

3. **Theatrical Staging as Character:** Elaborate constructed environments (painted backdrops, props, lighting geometry) that function as psychological metaphors. Background density 60-75% of frame; environment equals figure importance.

4. **Psychological Intensity & Discomfort:** Poses suggesting vulnerability, power, sexuality, or alienation. Expressions ranging from serene to disturbed. Allegorical themes addressing mortality, desire, consumption, identity.

**Period Framing:** Active 1987-present; major works 1995-2020. Contemporary production aesthetic throughout; no historical period constraints within LaChapelle's career.

**Tone Tag:** Hyper-real theatrical intensity; surrealist psychological depth; contemporary celebrity commentary; vivid color maximalism.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Digital-era photography (1990s-present). All color processing characteristic of contemporary digital cinema color grading (vivid, hypersat, intentionally constructed). No film grain; pristine digital finish or hand-finished inkjet print quality.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

### CELEBRITY PORTRAIT GLAMOUR (High-Key Studio Elegance)

#### Context
Controlled studio environment emphasizing face-as-subject. Theatrical lighting creates psychological presence. Subject isolated against simple or constructed background. Theatrical intensity balanced with commercial glamour. Figure 45-60% frame dominance.

#### Measurements
- Face region luminance (L%): 80-85% (well-lit, glamorous)
- Shadow floor minimum (L%): 22-25% (detail preservation)
- Highlight ceiling (L%): 91-95% (eye specular only)
- Contrast ratio: 1:3.2–3.8 (theatrical but readable)
- Flesh tone base hex: #E8C9B0 at 80% lightness
- Eye highlight geometry: Twin specular at L: 91-95%, positioned 45°/315° from optical axis
- Tonal steps (face): 6-7 distinct value zones
- Edge softness coefficient: 0.75-0.85 (sfumato transitions, not hard edges)
- Head-to-body ratio: 1:7.4 ± 0.2
- Eye width: 42-48% of face width
- Background saturation: S: 90-100% (hypersat theatrical color field)
- Background density: 40-50% of frame

#### Technique
- **Lighting geometry:** Key light positioned 50-60° camera-left/right, 45° elevation. Fill light positioned opposite at 1:3.2-1:3.8 ratio (creates dimensional modeling without flatness).
- **Eye rendering (critical):** Both eyes must contain baroque dual-reflection geometry. Specular highlights positioned symmetrically at 45° and 315° from optical axis. Each highlight L: 91-95%, size 2-3mm equivalent. Iris rendered with 4-5 tonal zones, pupil pure black.
- **Sfumato edge treatment:** All facial contours transition via gradual tonal shifts (no hard edges). Transition zones ≥1-2mm gradient distance. Cheekbones, jawline, nose edges all softly modeled.
- **Color grading:** Hyper-saturated background (S: 90-100%). Flesh tones warm (H: 20-30°) against cool backgrounds (H: 210-240°) creating split-complementary contrast.
- **Skin surface:** Hyper-real smoothness (L: 88-95% highlights, zero texture). Blemish removal only; subtle pore structure acceptable. Surface finish glossy (photographic C-print sheen).
- **Makeup integration:** Makeup as co-subject. Eye makeup rendering with precision (eyeliner geometry, shadow placement). Lip definition clear but not harsh. Foundation seamless.

#### Validation
- ✓ Eye highlights contain twin specular geometry (both eyes, symmetrical positioning)
- ✓ Face luminance L: 80-85% (not overexposed, not underexposed)
- ✓ Shadow floor L ≥ 22% (no crushing)
- ✓ Contrast ratio within 1:3.2–3.8 range
- ✓ Tonal steps (face) count 6-7 distinct zones
- ✓ Edge softness: no hard contours visible; all transitions sfumato
- ✓ Head-to-body ratio 1:7.4 ± 0.2
- ✓ Background density 40-50%
- ✓ Background saturation S ≥ 90%

### TABLEAU ALLEGORY & NARRATIVE (Multi-Figure Symbolic Composition)

#### Context
Multi-figure composition addressing allegorical themes (Last Supper reframing, contemporary mythology, power dynamics). Figures arranged with hierarchical intention. Dramatic lighting creates narrative space. Background 65-75% of frame; environmental narrative essential.

#### Measurements
- Overall scene luminance (L%): 50-65% (darker, more dramatic than celebrity glamour)
- Face region luminance (L%): 65-72% (supporting cast dimmer than primary subject)
- Shadow floor minimum (L%): 20-24%
- Highlight ceiling (L%): 90-95% (eye specular/primary figure only)
- Contrast ratio: 1:4.0–5.2 (high drama)
- Primary figure prominence: 40-50% of frame
- Secondary figures: 15-25% frame area each (hierarchical scaling)
- Background density: 65-75% of frame
- Flesh tone variation: Base #E8C9B0 adjustable by context (shadows darker, highlights warmer)
- Tonal steps (face): 5-7 zones per figure
- Eye geometry: Baroque dual-reflection on primary figure only
- Edge softness: 0.70-0.80 coefficient
- Head-to-body ratio: 1:7.3–7.5 (consistency across all figures)

#### Technique
- **Hierarchical lighting:** Primary figure receives key light (50-60° angle, 45° elevation). Secondary figures lit with fill-only (dimmer, less dimensional). Background receives accent lighting creating depth.
- **Composition logic:** Symmetrical or rule-of-thirds arrangement depending on allegorical intent. Primary figure positioned central or on intersection lines. Secondary figures flanking or arranged around primary subject. Diagonal energy if narrative tension required (45° or 135° orientation).
- **Allegorical staging:** Props, positioning, and background all contribute to symbolic narrative. Religious iconography repurposed (halos, angelic positioning, sacramental objects). Last Supper framing common.
- **Color grading:** Background may be monochromatic (single saturated hue) or split-complementary. Flesh tones unified across all figures.
- **Depth layering:** Minimum 2-4 distinct depth planes (foreground figure, mid-ground secondary, background environment, sky/backdrop).
- **Psychological intensity:** Expressions and poses range from serene to disturbed, creating psychological tension. Direct gazes, averted eyes, physical contact/separation all carry meaning.

#### Validation
- ✓ Multi-figure composition with clear hierarchy (primary ≥ secondary)
- ✓ Scene luminance L: 50-65%
- ✓ Background density 65-75%
- ✓ Allegorical narrative visible (props, positioning, symbolism)
- ✓ Depth layering present (≥2-4 distinct planes)
- ✓ Contrast ratio within 1:4.0–5.2
- ✓ Primary figure contains baroque dual-eye reflections

### ENVIRONMENTAL SURREALISM (Psychological Landscape)

#### Context
Figure embedded in surrealist environment where setting is co-protagonist. Impossible or dreamlike staging. Psychological intensity paramount. Figure 35-55% frame; environment 60-85% dominates visual hierarchy. Color manipulation extreme (neon, day-glo, impossible hues).

#### Measurements
- Overall scene luminance (L%): 45-70% (varies wildly by color grading intent)
- Face region luminance (L%): 65-78% (figure remains readable despite environment chaos)
- Shadow floor: 15-26% (variable for surrealist effect)
- Highlight ceiling: 88-95%
- Contrast ratio: 1:2.5–6.0 (highly variable for surrealist mood)
- Figure prominence: 35-55% of frame (subordinate to environment)
- Background density: 60-85% (environment dominates)
- Saturation range (environment): S: 50-100% (extreme variation; day-glo neons possible)
- Primary background hue: H: highly variable (reds, cyans, greens, impossible combinations)
- Flesh tone: #E8C9B0 base maintained but may appear unnatural against surrealist environment
- Tonal steps: 5-8 zones (variable due to environment complexity)
- Edge softness: 0.72-0.82 coefficient

#### Technique
- **Impossible environments:** Surrealist staging where physics/reality violated. Geometric color fields, dreamlike architectural spaces, impossible material combinations, allegorical object placement.
- **Psychological displacement:** Figure positioned awkwardly, dwarfed by environment, or isolated. Composition creates unsettling psychological space.
- **Color grading (extreme):** Neon palettes (day-glo yellows #FFFF00, electric pinks #FF1493, cyan #00FFFF). Split-complementary with exaggerated saturation. Hue shifts impossible in nature.
- **Environmental narrative:** Surrealist props, painted backdrops, digital composite elements, architectural distortion. Environment tells allegorical story (consumption, alienation, transformation).
- **Lighting geometry:** Complex, sometimes contradictory. Multiple light sources at impossible angles. Shadows may not align with light logic (dreamlike inconsistency authorized).
- **Psychological intensity:** Expressions ranging from serene to disturbing. Poses suggesting vulnerability, dissociation, or power. Psychological discomfort intended.

#### Validation
- ✓ Surrealist environment visible (impossible geometry, dreamlike quality, allegorical props)
- ✓ Figure 35-55% of frame
- ✓ Background density 60-85%
- ✓ Face remains luminous (L: 65-78%) despite chaotic environment
- ✓ Color grading extreme (saturation S ≥ 70% in environment, possible day-glo hues)
- ✓ Psychological intensity evident (expression/pose/setting create discomfort or awe)
- ✓ Composite construction visible (elements don't align with natural photography)

### UNIVERSAL TECHNIQUE ANCHORS (Apply to All Modes)

- **Facial Architecture Anchor:** Gender-specific feature construction with concrete measurements. Female: eye width 42-48% of face, face width 28-32% of head height, cheekbones prominent. Male: jaw angle 120-135°, chin projection 15-20% of face length. All genders: head-to-body ratio 1:7.4±0.2 (refined proportion, no stylization distortion).

- **Eye Rendering Anchor (Critical):** Both eyes MUST contain baroque dual-reflection geometry. Specular highlights positioned symmetrically at 45°/315° from optical axis. Each highlight L: 91-95%, size 2-3mm equivalent. Iris rendered with 4-5 tonal zones. Pupil pure black. NO hard-edged eye definition; all contours sfumato.

- **Pose Integrity Anchor:** Mode-specific pose flags govern gesture. Celebrity Portrait: power-stance or seated-throne (controlled authority). Tableau: adlocutio or hierarchical-static (symbolic positioning). Environmental: psychological-tension or contorted-psychological (discomfort or vulnerability).

- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Head-to-body ratio 1:7.4±0.2 (proportional elegance without distortion). No stylization permitted. Multi-figure compositions maintain consistency across all subjects.

- **Material Authenticity Anchor:** Digital C-print or hand-finished inkjet aesthetic. Hyper-real smooth skin (L: 88-95% highlights). Zero film grain; pristine digital finish or fine art paper texture. Color grading characteristic of contemporary digital cinema (vivid, hypersat, intentionally constructed).

- **Period Consistency Anchor:** Production methods authentic to 1990s-present digital photography. Medium-format digital capture or scanned film. Photoshop digital compositing. Contemporary color grading tools. NO analog photographic accident; all elements intentionally constructed.

- **Production Method Anchor:** Digital composite photography. Shot on Hasselblad/Mamiya (film) or Canon 5D series (digital). Color grading in Photoshop or Lightroom. Final print: C-print glossy or fine art inkjet. All elements seamlessly composited; impossible scenarios rendered photorealistic.

- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for declared aspect ratio (3:4 portrait, 4:5 contemporary, 16:9 cinematic). Background extension mandatory; environmental narrative requires space.

- **Gender Expression Consistency Anchor:** Subject's presented gender maintained across all modes. Styling mandates preserve gender identity using period-contemporary conventions (1990s-present). Cross-mode consistency: same subject rendered as same gender in Celebrity Portrait / Tableau / Environmental modes.

**VOCABULARY WARNINGS (Avoid):**

- ❌ `"ornate"`, `"ornament"`, `"elaborate"` — May trigger gallery framing; use `"theatrical"` instead
- ❌ `"natural"`, `"organic"`, `"authentic"` — Contradicts constructed aesthetic; use `"theatrical"`, `"constructed"`, `"staged"`
- ❌ `"beautiful"`, `"pleasant"`, `"harmonious"` — Risk softening psychological intensity; use `"striking"`, `"intense"`, `"commanding"`
- ❌ `"subtle"`, `"understated"`, `"minimal"` — Undermines hyper-real maximalism; use `"pronounced"`, `"vivid"`, `"striking"`
- ✅ Use instead: `"theatrical"`, `"staged"`, `"constructed"`, `"digital composite"`, `"glossy"`, `"smooth"`, `"vivid"`, `"saturated"`, `"intense"`, `"psychological"`, `"allegorical"`, `"hyper-real"`

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS (Apply to Final Aspect Ratio):**

**FOR PORTRAIT RATIOS (3:4, 4:5):** Vertical emphasis, figure dominance 45-60%, eyes positioned on rule-of-thirds intersection lines, background 40-50% (Celebrity Portrait) or 65-75% (Tableau/Environmental).

**FOR WIDESCREEN (16:9):** Horizontal panoramic flow, multi-figure capability, environment 60-85% dominates, figure 35-55% occupies frame strategically. Cinematic theatrical staging.

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (Mode-Differentiated):**

**CELEBRITY PORTRAIT GLAMOUR - Composition:**

- **Photographic framing regime:** Seamless studio, corner compositions (figure ¾ to full-length), close-crop (face/shoulders). Studio strobe modeling creates dimensional lighting without shadows becoming subjects.
- **Grid/symmetry authority:** Rule-of-thirds positioning (primary subject eyes on intersection lines). Symmetrical facial presentation or slight profile for psychological power.
- **Figure:Ground %:** Figure 45-60%, background 40-50%. Background occupies supporting role (colored field, theatrical backdrop, minimalist geometry).
- **Lighting logic:** Key light 50-60° angle, 45° elevation. Fill positioned opposite at 1:3.2-1:3.8 ratio. Creates dimensional modeling without unflattering shadow.
- **Detail:Negative Space ratio:** Face region detailed (makeup, eye geometry); background simplified (monochromatic or subtle gradient).
- **Psychological intent:** Power, glamour, commanding presence. Direct gaze or psychological distance. Confidence or vulnerability depending on narrative.

**TABLEAU ALLEGORY & NARRATIVE - Composition:**

- **Multi-figure geometry:** Hierarchical positioning (primary central or rule-of-thirds; secondary flanking or subordinate). Symbolic arrangement (religious: Last Supper geometry; mythological: classical frieze).
- **Grid/symmetry authority:** Symmetrical for formal allegory; asymmetrical for psychological tension. Diagonal thrust for narrative energy (45°/135° orientation possible).
- **Figure:Ground %:** Primary subject 40-50%, secondary figures 15-25% each, background 65-75%. Environment becomes narrative co-protagonist.
- **Depth layering:** Minimum 2-4 distinct planes (foreground, mid-ground, background, sky). Aerial perspective with recessive colors/reduced saturation in distance.
- **Lighting logic:** Complex multi-source lighting. Primary figure receives key light (dimensional). Secondary figures supported by fill or ambient. Background accent lighting creates depth separation.
- **Psychological narrative:** Composition tells allegorical story through positioning, gesture, and symbolic prop placement.

**ENVIRONMENTAL SURREALISM - Composition:**

- **Surrealist geometry:** Impossible or dream-logic spatial arrangement. Figure may be dwarfed, isolated, or embedded within environment. Contradictory spatial cues authorized.
- **Grid/symmetry:** Asymmetrical and unstable. Off-center positioning emphasizes psychological displacement. Diagonal energy maximized.
- **Figure:Ground %:** Figure 35-55%, environment 60-85% dominates. Environment is visual protagonist.
- **Depth layering:** Complex, possibly contradictory. Dream-logic spatial inconsistency authorized (shadows don't align with light sources, impossible vanishing points).
- **Lighting logic:** Multiple contradictory light sources possible. Dream-logic non-realism authorized for psychological effect.
- **Color logic:** Impossible hue combinations, day-glo saturations, split-complementary extremes. Neon colors (electric pink, cyan, yellow-green) permitted.
- **Psychological intensity:** Composition creates unease, awe, or psychological disruption. Viewer discomfort potential (authorized for artistic intent).

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Studio (Celebrity Portrait: white/colored backdrop, theatrical lighting); Theatrical (Tableau: allegorical staging, religious iconography); Surrealist (Environmental: impossible architecture, dream-logic geometry).

- **Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT ENTIRELY. No borders, mounting hardware, gallery frames, or presentation context. Clean artifact only.

- **Production Context Anchor:** Digital photography (1990s-present), medium-format or digital capture, Photoshop compositing, C-print or inkjet final output. All elements intentionally constructed; no analog accident.

- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for declared ratio (final adapted ratio if Section 2.1 applied). 3:4 portrait emphasis; 4:5 contemporary gallery; 16:9 cinematic panoramic.

- **Gender Expression Anchor:** Subject's presented gender maintained through period-contemporary styling (1990s-present). Cross-mode consistency: same subject renders as same gender in all modes.

- **Mode-Specific Composition Anchor:**
  - **Celebrity Portrait:** Studio elegance, theatrical lighting, figure 45-60%, psychological power
  - **Tableau Allegory:** Multi-figure hierarchy, allegorical narrative, background 65-75%, symbolic arrangement
  - **Environmental Surrealism:** Impossible staging, figure embedded in environment, psychological displacement, color logic extreme
