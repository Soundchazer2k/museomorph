# Neil Leifer Photography Framework v1.0

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

You are generating **Neil Leifer sports photography** from the **1960–1990 era**. Every image captures the **decisive moment**—the peak frame of athletic action where composition, lighting, and human drama converge. The work is always a still photograph, composed with the eye of a visual storyteller who elevated sports photojournalism to fine art through innovative camera placement, masterful Kodachrome color control, and obsessive pursuit of the peak action instant.

**Likeness Mandate (Critical):**

1. **Peak-Action Framing**: Subject frozen at climax of motion—maximum tension, impact, or expression. Not anticipation, not resolution. Only the apex.
2. **Strobe + Ambient Light Integration**: Signature dual-light system creating distinctive shadow architecture: sharp primary shadows (strobe) with secondary luminescence layer (ambient). Without this, the image reads digital/contemporary.
3. **Telephoto Compression**: Background optically flattened (100–600mm range). Subject isolated through focal length physics, not cropping. Depth perceptually compressed but compositionally layered.
4. **Kodachrome Color Mastery**: Vibrant, saturated color with warm bias in shadows, neutral-cool highlights. Specific to film chemistry—reds punch (#CC2200–#FF3300), blues anchor (#0033AA–#0055DD), skin tones warm (#C89968–#E8B896).
5. **Film Grain Authenticity**: Visible grain at 100–400 ISO equivalent. Uniform distribution, scale-consistent with era film (Kodachrome, Ektachrome). Not digital noise; not temporal consistency artifacts.

**Aspect Ratio:** Output must match declared NanoBanana native ratio exactly. No pillar-boxing, no letterboxing.

**Face-Treatment Flag**: `film-grain-triX` or `color-surge` (photographic archetype).

**Pose Flag**: `candid-motion` (athletic action), `contrapposto` (portrait mode), or `power-stance` (confrontational moment).

**Canvas Control Flag**: `format-native` (no adaptation needed; all declared ratios are NanoBanana native).

**Style Dominance**: Photographic documentary realism with period-authentic film characteristics dominates all other considerations.

**Mode Selector**: `editorial` (action), `gallery` (portrait), or `documentary` (environmental).

**Final Ratio Confirmation**: Output must be exactly **[specified ratio]**, no exceptions.

---

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**NANOBANANA SUPPORTED RATIOS (All Native—No Adaptation):**

- ✅ `2:3` (portrait tall—832×1248) — preferred for athlete studies
- ✅ `3:4` (portrait—864×1184) — preferred for head/torso isolation
- ✅ `4:3` (landscape—1184×864) — action sequences, environmental context
- ✅ `1:1` (square—1024×1024) — portrait symmetry, rare
- ✅ `16:9` (widescreen—1344×768) — panoramic action, stadium context

**Dominant Format Strategy by Mode:**

| Mode | Primary Ratio | Secondary | Subject Scale |
|------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Decisive Moment** | 4:3 or 16:9 | 2:3 | 35–65% frame |
| **Portrait Isolation** | 2:3 or 3:4 | 1:1 | 50–80% frame |
| **Environmental Narrative** | 16:9 or 4:3 | 2:3 | 15–40% frame |

**Ratio Enforcement:** Since all declared ratios are NanoBanana-native, no adaptation required. Compose directly for target ratio; no letterboxing, no pillar-boxing, no padding. Canvas recomposition is direct.

**Spatial Allocation per Mode:**

- **Decisive Moment**: Subject positioned at tertiary intersection (rule of thirds), motion vector pointing into negative space. Dynamic diagonal composition.
- **Portrait Isolation**: Eyes at upper-third intersection, body centered vertically. Symmetrical centering preferred.
- **Environmental Narrative**: Subject at secondary diagonal, environment 60–70% frame, location context prominent.

**Format Justification**: Leifer's 1960–1990 work reflects magazine publication standards (Life, Sports Illustrated, editorial assignments). Landscape ratios (4:3, 16:9) accommodate action sequences; portrait ratios (2:3, 3:4) support editorial spreads and gallery exhibition. All choices are historically authentic to period publishing practices.

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:**

Leifer's practice evolved from foundational photojournalism traditions (Life magazine documentary realism, Henri Cartier-Bresson's decisive moment theory) and technical innovations in sports coverage. He drew inspiration from cinema and classical painting for compositional drama and lighting geometry, translating visual language from fine art into sports photography.

**Medium & Production Method:**

- **Primary Cameras**: Nikon F series (35mm, professional standard), Hasselblad (medium format, high color saturation), later Canon EOS
- **Lenses**: Nikkor 24mm, 50mm, 105mm, 200mm, 300mm, 400mm, 600mm telephoto (1960s–1990s era precision optics)
- **Film Stocks (color-era dominance)**: Kodachrome 64 & 200 (slide film, ultra-saturated, warm bias), Ektachrome (slide film, crisp, cooler), Tri-X black & white (low-light)
- **Lighting Equipment**: Electronic strobe with wireless/remote sync systems, available arena/stadium tungsten ambient
- **Processing**: Darkroom-quality color printing (dodging, burning, contrast refinement) through 1980s, later digital workflow retaining film signature
- **Paper & Finish**: High-quality photographic papers (Cibachrome for vibrant colors, glossy finish standard)

**Thematic Purpose:**

Leifer's work transcends sports photojournalism by capturing the emotional and physical apex of athletic competition. His images document not just action, but human drama—the intensity, tension, and climactic moments that define sports. He elevated the genre through technical mastery (remote camera placement, innovative strobe sync) and visual storytelling that transformed fleeting moments into iconic cultural artifacts.

**Three Hallmark Motifs (Quantified):**

1. **Peak-Action Frame with Strobe + Ambient Integration**
   - Subject caught at maximum tension or impact (jump apex, punch connection, diving catch)
   - Dual-light shadow architecture: primary shadow (strobe, 0.30–0.40 edge softness) + secondary shadow (ambient fill, 0.60–0.75 softness)
   - Key:fill ratio 3:1 to 5:1 (strong directionality)
   - Color temperature duality: strobe cool (5600K), ambient warm (tungsten 3200K)
   - Result: Subject frozen and isolated, background slightly blurred, lighting reveals form and musculature

2. **Kodachrome Saturated Color Palette with Warm Shadow Cast**
   - Dominant palette: RGB (99±42, 97±43, 96±46) neutral-warm baseline #636160
   - Saturated athletic wear: Reds #CC2200–#FF3300, Blues #0033AA–#0055DD (high chroma, film saturation)
   - Skin tones: #C89968–#E8B896 (consistent warm golden undertone across all athletes)
   - Shadow color cast: Magenta/warm shift (Kodachrome characteristic cross-processing)
   - Highlight curve: Neutral to cool (film toe/shoulder compression)
   - Film grain: ISO 100–400 equivalent, uniform distribution, characteristic color fringing in grain

3. **Telephoto Compression with Graduated Depth Layers**
   - Focal length signature: 100–600mm equivalent (optically compressed background)
   - Depth planes: Foreground (subject sharp, strobe-lit), mid-layer (secondary context, soft 0.45–0.60 softness), background (stadium/venue abstracted, 0.70–0.85 softness)
   - Vignetting: 5–15% edge darkening (natural lens falloff, not added in postprocessing)
   - Bokeh character: Soft, swirled (characteristic of era telephoto optics)
   - No extreme distortion: Straight lines remain straight (film-era precision)

**Period Framing:** Artist active **1960–1990**. Peak creative output 1964–1985 (color mastery era). Framework authenticates to this period exclusively.

**Tone Tag**: Documentary realism with dramatic compositional intent; emotional intensity balanced with technical precision; hero shot aesthetic applied to athletic subjects.

**Innovation Line (Photography-Specific):**

- **Remote Camera Placement**: Revolutionary use of cameras rigged in rafters, behind goals, under boxing rings to achieve previously impossible angles (iconic 1966 Ali overhead shot)
- **Strobe + Ambient Sync**: Early mastery of wireless strobe triggering integrated with available light, creating signature dual-shadow architecture
- **Color Film Pioneering**: Adoption of Kodachrome for sports when much photojournalism remained black & white; pushed color film to its saturation limits
- **Motor Drive Sequences**: Adoption of motor-driven continuous shooting to capture peak frame from series; rigorous editorial selection process (hundreds of frames for one iconic image)

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

### Decisive Moment (Action Apex)

#### Context

The subject is frozen mid-motion at peak athletic intensity—jump apex, punch connection, diving catch, moment of impact. Strobe + ambient tungsten integration creates sharp subject isolation against spatially compressed stadium/arena background. Kodachrome saturation and warm shadow cast define the era-specific color language. Dynamic diagonal composition emphasizes motion trajectory and subject agency.

#### Measurements

- **Pose angles**: Extreme athletic flexion (45–90° knee/elbow/hip joints), shoulder rotation 40–70°, head tracking action line
- **Subject scale**: 35–65% frame occupation (primary subject isolation without environmental dominance)
- **Tonal distribution**: Dark 48.9% ± 26.6%, Midtone 32.4% ± 21.2%, Bright 16.2% ± 14.6%
- **Contrast ratio**: 6.2x mean (range 3.17x–24.36x acceptable)
- **Shadow architecture**: Primary shadow edge softness 0.30–0.40 (strobe-defined), secondary shadow 0.60–0.75 (ambient fill), background 0.70–0.85
- **Light ratio**: 3:1 to 5:1 key:fill (strong directionality)
- **Color palette**: RGB baseline (99±42, 97±43, 96±46) #636160, saturated wear Reds #CC2200–#FF3300, Blues #0033AA–#0055DD, skin #C89968–#E8B896
- **Film grain**: ISO 200 equivalent (2–3px scale, uniform distribution, characteristic color fringing)
- **Tonal zones**: 5–7 distinct value steps, shadow floor 25–30%, highlight ceiling 220–240
- **Vignetting**: 5–15% edge darkening (natural lens falloff, corners)
- **Depth layers**: 3 distinct planes (subject sharp, mid-layer 0.45–0.60 softness, background 0.70–0.85)

#### Technique

- **Compositional anchor**: Subject positioned at tertiary intersection (rule of thirds), motion vector diagonal across frame, negative space 35–40%
- **Strobe placement**: 45–90° from subject (often elevated for boxing, frontal-elevated for football), wireless sync at 1/200s or faster
- **Ambient fill**: Tungsten arena light (3200K), 3:1 to 5:1 ratio below strobe output
- **Telephoto focal length**: 100–600mm equivalent (compress background, flatten depth)
- **Shutter speed**: 1/200–1/500s (freeze motion, sync with strobe)
- **Aperture**: f/4–f/8 (depth of field graduated, subject sharp, background soft)
- **Film stock**: Kodachrome 64 or 200 (or Ektachrome equivalent), pushed if necessary for low-light venues
- **Motor drive**: Continuous shooting to capture peak frame from series
- **Exposure metering**: Spot meter on subject skin tone, expose for highlights (film latitude preserves shadows)
- **Color temperature**: Strobe daylight-balanced (5600K), arena tungsten (3200K) creates warm shadow cast
- **Post-processing**: Minimal dodging/burning in darkroom; color correction to enforce film stock characteristic; no desaturation, no digital smoothing

### Portrait Isolation (Studio/Close)

#### Context

Single athlete head/torso framing (50–80% frame), studio or natural window key light with strobe fill. Shallow depth-of-field emphasizes facial detail and musculature. Kodachrome color and strobe micro-contrast create intimate, almost sculptural presence. Symmetrical centering and controlled background blur dominate composition.

#### Measurements

- **Subject scale**: 50–80% frame occupation (head/shoulders dominance)
- **Head:body ratio**: 1:7.5 ± 5% (anatomically authentic)
- **Face edge softness**: 0.55 ± 0.15 (subject sharp, background heavily blurred)
- **Background edge softness**: 0.70–0.85 (bokeh blur, minimal detail)
- **Negative space**: 20–30% (tight framing, intimate)
- **Tonal distribution**: Lower dark %, higher bright % (portrait-optimized lighting)
- **Color palette**: Skin tones #C89968–#E8B896 (warm, consistent), neutral background (avoid distracting color)
- **Film grain**: ISO 100 equivalent (fine grain, 1–2px, smooth but present)
- **Catchlight**: Visible in eyes (strobe specular reflection, characteristic)
- **Muscle definition**: Readable through lighting geometry, not stylized exaggeration
- **Skin texture**: Pore-level visible (Kodachrome micro-contrast), sweat/moisture as specular highlight

#### Technique

- **Compositional anchor**: Vertical center line symmetry, eyes at upper-third intersection, shoulders centered below
- **Key light**: 45° from subject (classic Rembrandt angle) or frontal-elevated for full face illumination
- **Fill light**: Soft diffused strobe or ambient fill (low power, 5:1 or lower ratio to key)
- **Focal length**: 85–135mm (classic portrait range, moderate telephoto compression avoids distortion)
- **Aperture**: f/2.8–f/4 (shallow depth of field, subject sharp, background bokeh)
- **Shutter speed**: 1/125–1/250s (sync with strobe, allow ambient fill)
- **Film stock**: Kodachrome 64 (fine grain optimal for detail, skin texture)
- **Exposure metering**: Incident meter on subject face, expose for midtones
- **Post-processing**: Minimal intervention; dodging to enhance catchlight, burning to define cheekbone shadow; no frequency separation, no beauty filters

#### Validation

- [ ] Subject centered vertically, eyes at upper-third intersection
- [ ] Face edge softness 0.55 ± 0.15 (subject sharp, background soft)
- [ ] Head:body ratio 1:7.5 ± 5% (authentic proportions)
- [ ] Catchlight visible in both eyes (strobe micro-reflection)
- [ ] Skin texture pore-level visible (Kodachrome characteristic)
- [ ] Muscle definition readable through lighting, not exaggerated
- [ ] Kodachrome color present: warm skin tone, neutral-cool highlights
- [ ] Film grain fine and uniform (1–2px, ISO 100 equivalent)
- [ ] No digital smoothing, no beauty filter signature
- [ ] Background bokeh soft and unobtrusive (0.70–0.85 softness)

### Environmental Narrative (Wide Context)

#### Context

Wide-angle perspective integrating subject (15–40% frame) with venue/stadium context (60–70% frame). Location authenticity paramount—crowd energy, arena architecture, environmental storytelling. Lower contrast (ambient stadium lighting dominance) and graduated depth-of-field create narrative immersion. Subject is integrated element, not isolated hero.

#### Measurements

- **Subject scale**: 15–40% frame occupation (environmental context dominant)
- **Negative space**: 60–70% (venue/location integration)
- **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 or 4:3 landscape (panoramic storytelling)
- **Background density**: 60–70% occupied (architecture, crowd texture, signage readable)
- **Depth layers**: 2–3 zones (subject mid-ground, arena mid/background, sky or far-ground abstracted)
- **Tonal distribution**: Lower dark %, higher bright % (ambient lighting, less shadow contrast)
- **Contrast ratio**: 3–4x (lower than action modes; ambient-dominated lighting)
- **Color palette**: Location-specific color casts (arena tungsten, natural daylight if outdoor)
- **Edge softness**: Graduated focus (subject 0.45–0.55, mid-layer 0.55–0.65, background 0.75+)
- **Film grain**: ISO 400 equivalent (coarser grain acceptable for wide environmental shots, pushes speed for light-capture)
- **Vignetting**: Subtle (2–5% edge darkening, less pronounced than action modes)

#### Technique

- **Compositional anchor**: Diagonal environmental integration, subject at secondary intersection, location context 60–70% frame
- **Focal length**: 24–50mm (wide-angle, environmental context, minimal telephoto compression)
- **Aperture**: f/4–f/5.6 (deeper depth of field to maintain arena/venue sharpness alongside subject)
- **Shutter speed**: 1/125–1/250s (accommodate ambient light dominance, strobe secondary fill if needed)
- **Film stock**: Kodachrome 200 (higher speed captures venue ambient light without excessive grain)
- **Strobe placement**: Secondary role (fill light only), balanced with ambient arena/stadium lighting
- **Exposure metering**: Matrix meter on full scene, expose for highlights (preserve arena/crowd detail)
- **Color grading**: Minimal intervention; color correction to preserve venue tungsten cast or daylight authenticity
- **Composition framing**: Rule of thirds extended horizontally; subject at tertiary line, horizon positioned at upper or lower third

#### Validation

- [ ] Subject scale 15–40% frame (environmental context dominant)
- [ ] Location/venue recognizable and authentic to period (1960–1990)
- [ ] Background density 60–70% (arena/stadium readable, not abstracted)
- [ ] Depth-of-field graduated (subject reasonably sharp, background softening)
- [ ] Ambient lighting dominant (lower contrast, 3–4x typical)
- [ ] Film grain appropriate to higher ISO (ISO 400 coarse grain acceptable)
- [ ] Vignetting subtle (2–5% corners, not aggressive)
- [ ] Kodachrome color with venue lighting authenticity (tungsten or daylight period-appropriate)
- [ ] Diagonal compositional logic clear (subject integrated into environmental narrative)
- [ ] No digitally-rendered crowd (crowd rendered as texture/energy, not individual faces)

---

### Universal Technique Anchors (All Modes)

- **Facial Architecture Anchor**: Male athletes rendered with authentic musculature definition through lighting geometry (not stylized exaggeration); female athletes with symmetrical face proportions, warm skin tone (#C89968–#E8B896), pore-level texture visible in close-ups
- **Pose Integrity Anchor**: Athletic poses within sport-specific realism (±5° tolerance on joint angles); weight distribution evident; no anatomically impossible positions
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor**: Head:body ratio 1:7.5 ± 5%; subject scale per mode (35–65% action, 50–80% portrait, 15–40% environmental); stylization serves authenticity, not distortion
- **Material Authenticity Anchor**: Film grain characteristic of Kodachrome/Ektachrome; strobe + ambient shadow architecture readable; no digital smoothing, no beauty filters, no HDR tone-mapping
- **Period Consistency Anchor**: 1960–1990 era film stocks (Kodachrome, Ektachrome, Tri-X); era-appropriate lighting equipment; no post-1990 camera signatures (digital sensor artifacts, image stabilization blur)
- **Production Method Anchor**: Darkroom-quality color printing techniques (dodging, burning); film-era color correction (no modern LUT grading); no Photoshop-era retouching signature
- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor**: All declared ratios are NanoBanana-native (2:3, 3:4, 4:3, 1:1, 16:9); no adaptation required; compose directly for target ratio
- **Gender Expression Consistency Anchor**: Male athletes retain masculine pose language and styling across all modes; female athletes retain feminine presentation; authentic athletic wear construction period-appropriate to 1960–1990 era

---

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**TEMPORAL WARDROBE MANDATE:**

Artist active period: **1960–1990** — ALL athlete wear must be period-authentic to this era. No modern sports technology, no synthetic athletic fabrics developed post-1990, no contemporary brand styling.

**CRITICAL PROHIBITION**: No modern athletic wear retention. All athlete clothing must be authentically reconstructed to 1960–1990 era standards.

**ANACHRONISM VIOLATION EXAMPLES (MUST AVOID):**

- ❌ Modern moisture-wicking fabrics (CoolMax, Dri-FIT introduced post-1990)
- ❌ Contemporary sports bras or modern undergarment designs
- ❌ Mesh athletic wear (post-1980s standard)
- ❌ Modern shoe technology (contemporary Nike/Adidas cushioning, gel inserts)
- ❌ Contemporary branding (modern logo designs, reflective tape, digital printing)
- ❌ Post-1990 uniform designs (updated team jersey cuts, contemporary fit)

**MODE-SPECIFIC WARDROBE TRACKS:**

### Decisive Moment (Action) – Athletic Wear

**Adult Male Athletes:**
- Jersey: Wool or cotton blend, 1960–1990 era team colors (authentic uniform cut for sport and year)
- Shorts/Pants: Cotton twill or canvas, authentic cut for sport (football leather pants, baseball knickers, boxing trunks)
- Undershirt: Cotton t-shirt or sleeveless tank (if visible), period-appropriate neckline
- Socks: Cotton, mid-calf, team colors where applicable
- Footwear: Sport-specific era boots/shoes (football cleats, baseball shoes, boxing boots—all leather/canvas, not modern synthetic)
- Visible equipment: Gloves (leather, era-appropriate padding), tape/wrappings, helmets (1960–1990 design standard)

**Adult Female Athletes (if applicable):**
- Jersey: Cotton blend, period-appropriate cut (modest by contemporary standards, authentic to sport, year, and era)
- Shorts/Pants: Cotton twill, knee-length or above-knee per sport and era (no modern athletic compression)
- Sports bra: Period-authentic construction (simple cotton or blend, not modern engineering, not visible unless sport-authentic)
- Undershirt: Cotton tank or sleeveless, period neckline
- Socks: Cotton, mid-calf, team colors
- Footwear: Sport-specific era shoes (leather/canvas, not modern)

**Fabric Behavior & Authenticity:**
- Cotton jerseys: Matte finish, natural drape, wrinkle realistically from motion (not pressed/pristine)
- Wool blends: Slight texture visible, authentic weight and thickness
- Leather equipment: Gloss or matte per type (gloves high-gloss, shoes leather-natural)
- No static cling, no stretch recovery (period-appropriate fabrics don't recover instantly)

### Portrait Isolation – Studio/Intimate Wear

**Adult Male Athletes:**
- Torso: Undershirt, tank, or bare-chested (sport-authentic, period-respectful)
- If clothed: simple undershirt or period-authentic casual shirt (cotton, neutral color)
- Minimal accessories (watch only if 1960–1990 era design, simple leather strap)

**Adult Female Athletes:**
- Torso: Sports bra (period-authentic, simple construction) or undershirt/tank
- If clothed: period-authentic casual or athletic top
- Minimal jewelry (none preferred, or simple period-authentic ring/bracelet if historically appropriate to subject)

**Lighting & Texture Priority**: Fabric texture and skin detail dominate; clothing secondary to musculature and expression.

### Environmental Narrative – Venue-Integrated Wear

Same as Decisive Moment (authentic era athletic wear), integrated into crowd/venue context.

**Temporal Color Palette Restrictions:**

- **All modes, 1960–1990 era only:**
  - Natural dyes and synthetic aniline dyes (both available post-1900)
  - Era-appropriate team colors (historically accurate jerseys for specified year)
  - No neon or fluorescent colors (post-1960s synthetic dyes)
  - Fabric dyes consistent with commercial dyeing practices of period

**HAIR TREATMENT – MANDATORY PRESERVATION AND PERIOD ADAPTATION:**

**CRITICAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Hair length MUST be preserved**: Short hair remains short, medium remains medium, long remains long
- **Hair color MUST be preserved**: Maintain subject's natural hair color exactly
- **Facial hair presence MUST be preserved**: If athlete has NO facial hair (clean-shaven), DO NOT add beards or stubble

**PERIOD STYLING ADAPTATION (Preserving length/color/presence):**

- **Short hair** → period short styles (1960–1990 athletic standards, gender-specific cuts)
- **Medium hair** → period medium styles (athlete-appropriate, era-authentic styling)
- **Long hair** → period long styles (rare in male athletes; if present, tied back or styled per era)
- **No modern hairstyles**: No undercuts, fades, contemporary women's layers, or post-1990 styling

**Props & Setting Conventions:**

**Permitted Props** (period-authentic, sport-specific):
- Sports balls (leather, era-appropriate design), bats, gloves, rackets
- Team signage visible in background (1960–1990 era branding only)
- Stadium architecture and bleacher seating (authentic to venue and era)
- Crowd figures (rendered as texture/energy, not individual detail)

**Prohibited Props**:
- ❌ Modern broadcast equipment (post-1990 microphones, wireless packs)
- ❌ Digital scoreboards (anachronistic; mechanical/early digital only)
- ❌ Contemporary brand logos or sponsor signage
- ❌ Modern athletic trainers or medical equipment visible

**Venue Authenticity:**
- All arenas/stadiums must exist and match 1960–1990 architectural record
- No contemporary renovations or modern signage
- Lighting fixtures, seating design, turf/field surface period-authentic

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**Compositional Archetypes (by Mode):**

### Dynamic Diagonal (Decisive Moment)

- Primary axis diagonal from lower-left to upper-right (or vice), carrying subject's motion vector
- Subject positioned on diagonal at tertiary intersection (1/3 or 2/3 frame)
- Motion vector pointing into negative space (visual continuation)
- Background layered along secondary diagonal, providing context without competition
- Rule of thirds: Subject focal point at tertiary intersection
- Negative space: 35–40% isolation effect

### Centered-Symmetrical (Portrait Isolation)

- Vertical center line symmetry (balanced framing)
- Head positioned upper third (eyes at tertiary intersection)
- Shoulders/torso centered vertically below
- Depth of field: Sharp subject (0.55 face softness), heavily blurred background (0.70+ softness)
- Negative space: 20–30% (tight, intimate)
- Facial symmetry balanced across vertical centerline

### Environmental Integration (Wide Context)

- Horizontal or gentle diagonal (stable, landscape-oriented)
- Subject positioned at secondary intersection (15–40% scale)
- Background density 60–70% (stadium/arena context readable)
- Depth graduated (subject sharp, mid-ground softening, background abstracted)
- Negative space 60–70% (environment-dominant)
- Horizontal rule-of-thirds anchor (subject mid-frame vertically, environment layered above/below)

**Lighting Patterns & Ratios (All Modes):**

**Primary: Strobe + Tungsten Hybrid**

- **Key Light** (strobe): Hard-edged, directional, 45–90° from subject
- **Fill Light** (ambient tungsten): Soft, omnidirectional arena ambient
- **Key:Fill Ratio**: 3:1 to 5:1 (strong directionality, readable shadows)
- **Color Temperature Duality**: Strobe cool (5600K), ambient warm (3200K tungsten)

**Tonal Range Targets (All Modes):**

- Shadow floor: 25–30% (no pure black; film latitude)
- Highlight ceiling: 220–240 (no blown whites; film compression)
- Midtone anchor: 120–140 (primary detail range)
- Distinct tonal zones: 5–7 major value steps
- Overall contrast ratio: 6.2x (range 3.17x–24.36x acceptable)

**Depth Plane Architecture (All Modes):**

1. **Foreground**: Subject (sharp, strobe-lit, dominant)
2. **Mid-layer**: Secondary action/context (soft, 0.45–0.60 softness)
3. **Background**: Stadium/venue (soft, 0.70–0.85 softness)
4. **Atmospheric Falloff**: Vignetting (5–15% edge darkening)

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Text Presence Policy:**

Neil Leifer's work is primarily photographic; typography is **minimal and incidental**, used only for environmental authenticity.

**Permitted Text Elements** (background, naturalistic):

- Venue signage (authentic 1960–1990 era branding, blurred background or small scale)
- Arena/stadium name visible on signage (period-accurate venue identification)
- Jersey numbers (integral to uniforms, not text overlay)
- Scoreboard numerals (mechanical or early digital, period-authentic font style)

**Prohibited Text Elements:**

- ❌ Watermarks or artist signatures (authenticity implicit in style, not explicit text)
- ❌ Contemporary branding or sponsor logos
- ❌ Captions, athlete names, or contextual labels (unless historically embedded in venue)
- ❌ Metadata visibility (ISO, aperture, shutter speed, photographer credit)

**Typography Emulation (If Arena Signage Required):**

- Font style: Sans-serif, bold weight (typical arena signage 1960–1990)
- Color: Contrasting venue colors (white on dark, dark on light; no gradients, no script)
- Placement: Blurred background (0.70+ softness) or small scale, never compositional emphasis
- Period authenticity: Font consistent with 1960–1990 sports venue standards

**Rationale**: Leifer's photographs are visual documents emphasizing composition, lighting, and human drama. Text, if present, is environmental and incidental—a natural part of venue context, never a compositional element.
