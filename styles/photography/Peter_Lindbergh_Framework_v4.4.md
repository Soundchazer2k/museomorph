about: >
  Peter Lindbergh (1944-2019) was a German fashion photographer who revolutionized the industry through his 
  uncompromising commitment to authenticity. Rather than airbrushing and retouching, Lindbergh captured subjects 
  with wrinkles, character marks, and emotional truth intact—creating a visual language that valued human 
  humanity over artificial perfection. His signature black-and-white aesthetic, achieved through Kodak Tri-X film, 
  baryta paper gelatin silver prints, and minimal darkroom manipulation (dodging/burning only), became instantly 
  recognizable. His 1990 Vogue cover featuring five supermodels sparked the supermodel era and proved that 
  authenticity, not retouching, could define beauty. Lindbergh's work spans editorial portraits, luxury brand 
  campaigns, and fine art monographs—all united by his humanist philosophy: "If you take out the wrinkles, you 
  take out the life."

# Peter Lindbergh — Unretouched Black & White Fashion Photography
## Universal Museum-Grade Prompt Framework v4.4 (NanoBanana Edition)

---

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Renderer Adaptation Mandate:** When target ratio unsupported by renderer, automatically apply nearest-match adaptation per Section 2.1.
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement Protocol:** Aspect ratio control is prompt-based only. Model may resist ratio instructions and default to non-standard outputs. Combat this through:
  - **Explicit ratio declaration** in multiple prompt locations (Section 1, Section 2, Section 6)
  - **Repetitive ratio reinforcement** using different phrasings
  - **Negative constraints** explicitly prohibiting unwanted ratios
  - **Compositional anchors** designed specifically for target ratio
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/gaze authenticity unless photorealistic.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("edge softness 0.97 coefficient", "shadow floor L=10-18%", "Kodak Tri-X grain signature") override descriptive language.
- **Anatomical Proportion Validation:** Standard 1:7.5 head-to-body ratio, no distortion or elongation. Authenticity mandates preservation of character marks, wrinkles, natural imperfections.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Film stock signature (Kodak Tri-X), darkroom technique (dodging/burning), baryta paper surface characteristics supersede aesthetic preferences.
- **Anti-Retouching Mandate:** CRITICAL—NO digital airbrushing, NO skin smoothing, NO feature alteration. Wrinkles, age marks, character details are AESTHETIC STRENGTH, not flaws to remove.
- **Gender Expression Authority:** Preserve subject's presented gender identity through period-accurate styling (contemporary 1980s-2010s wardrobe). Consistency across modes required.
- **Authenticity-First Philosophy:** Lindbergh's foundational principle: "If you take out the wrinkles, you take out the life." Every specification serves this philosophy.

- **Face-Treatment Flags (choose one, per mode):**
  - *Photography-Specific:* `film-grain-triX`, `baryta-paper-matte`, `gelatin-silver-archival`, `darkroom-dodging-burning`, `minimal-retouching-philosophy`, `unretouched-authenticity`
  - *Lighting Technique:* `diffuse-softbox`, `overcast-window-light`, `frontal-key-light`, `dramatic-shadow-ratio`, `soft-edge-transition`
  - *Subject Philosophy:* `psychological-intensity`, `character-revelation`, `wrinkle-preservation`, `age-authenticity`, `humanist-perspective`

- **Pose Flags (choose one):** `frontal-direct-gaze`, `three-quarter-turn`, `contemplative-stillness`, `psychological-distance`, `natural-weight-distribution`, `minimal-gesture`

- **Canvas Control Flags (choose one):** `strict-reframe`, `format-native`

- **Material Physics Authority:** Baryta-based gelatin silver print surface, matte finish, archival quality, deep blacks (L=5-20%), controlled whites (L=220-236%), Kodak Tri-X grain signature visible at 1:1 print scale.

- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Subject framing 25-45% of image (tight intimate portrait scale), negative space 50-70% (psychological breathing room), background detail <5% (studio or neutral natural light).

- **Cultural Production Authenticity:** Analogue-era photography (1980s-2010s), film-to-print darkroom workflow, no digital post-processing beyond archive scanning. Period authenticity is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

- **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are hard targets.

- **Text policy:** Text omitted entirely (Section 8 prohibits typography).

- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; character marks and wrinkles MANDATED (authenticity); minimal props.

- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Adults default to contemporary (1980s-2010s) civilian wardrobe; minors modest and period-appropriate; NO modern anachronisms.

- **Gender expression:** Respect presented gender identity with period-contemporary styling. Cross-mode consistency required (Editorial/Commercial/Fine Art maintain same gender expression).

- **Material authenticity:** Surface exhibits genuine baryta paper characteristics (smooth whites, deep blacks, matte finish, archival grain). NO digital smoothing, NO Instagram effects, NO modern post-processing filters. Tri-X grain organic and visible.

- **Anti-Retouching Enforcement:** Skin texture authentic to age and subject; wrinkles preserved; age marks visible; character details PROTECTED from removal; NO airbrushing signature; NO softening filters; NO beauty-mode defaults.

- **Composition boundaries:** Figure centered or rule-of-thirds positioned; 50-70% negative space; flat picture plane (no atmospheric recession); minimal background detail.

- **Mode Consistency Authority:** Same subject appearing across Editorial/Commercial/Fine Art modes maintains identical gender presentation, facial structure, and character marks—only lighting and framing change per mode.

- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid genre drift (fashion photography, not editorial illustration); avoid digital smoothing autopilot; avoid beauty-filter defaults; avoid artificial skin enhancement.

- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

- **STRICT TERMINATION:** Framework ends at Section 8. DO NOT add commentary, explanations, historical context, or any content beyond Section 8.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CRITICAL PREAMBLE:**

This framework generates black-and-white photographs in the style of Peter Lindbergh, with **MANDATORY authenticity**. 

**MANDATORY SPECIFICATION:** Generate unretouched black-and-white portrait photograph in Peter Lindbergh's signature style—character marks, wrinkles, age authenticity preserved as aesthetic strength. NO digital airbrushing, NO skin smoothing, NO feature alteration. Wrinkles = life, wrinkles = authenticity.

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely. Strict reframe required.
- **RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **[X:Y]**. This is a hard requirement. Repeat: EXACT **[X:Y]** ratio, no deviations.
- Generate **[Mode Name]** black-and-white portrait photograph in **Peter Lindbergh's signature photographic style**.
- Identity via psychological depth, character expression, gaze authenticity.
- **Gender Expression Mandate:** Preserve subject's presented gender identity through contemporary period-appropriate styling (1980s-2010s wardrobe conventions). Masculine subjects remain masculine across all modes; feminine subjects remain feminine across all modes.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original styling, wardrobe, and lighting appropriate to Lindbergh's humanist aesthetic. Avoid copyrighted imagery.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `[photography-specific flag per mode]` (e.g., `film-grain-triX`, `unretouched-authenticity`, `baryta-paper-matte`)
- **Pose Flag:** `[pose flag per mode]` (e.g., `frontal-direct-gaze`, `psychological-intensity`)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Anti-Retouching Declaration (CRITICAL):** Subject's natural appearance is MANDATORY. Wrinkles, age marks, character lines, skin texture are AESTHETIC STRENGTH. No digital smoothing. No beauty-mode defaults. No airbrushing signature. Lindbergh philosophy: "If you take out the wrinkles, you take out the life."
- **Style Dominance Line:** Black-and-white analogue photography aesthetic (Kodak Tri-X, baryta paper, darkroom dodging/burning, minimal retouching).
- **Mode Selector:** **[Editorial Portrait / Commercial Campaign / Fine Art Portrait]** (MANDATORY per mode)
- **Final Ratio Confirmation:** Output must be exactly **[X:Y ratio]**, no exceptions. Repeat confirmation: EXACT **[X:Y]** aspect ratio required.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**NANOBANANA SUPPORTED RATIOS (Native - No Adaptation Required):**

- ✅ `1:1` (square - 1024×1024)
- ✅ `3:4` (portrait - 864×1184)
- ✅ `4:3` (landscape - 1184×864)
- ✅ `4:5` (portrait - 896×1152)
- ✅ `16:9` (widescreen - 1344×768)

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** 
- **Editorial Portrait Mode:** 3:4 (portrait orientation, tight intimate framing)
- **Commercial Campaign Mode:** 4:3 or 16:9 (landscape, product-adjacent context)
- **Fine Art Portrait Mode:** 1:1 (square format, museum monographic presentation)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

**Editorial Portrait Mode (3:4):**
- **Ratio Status:** Native support
- **Reframing Method:** Recompose for portrait orientation; center or rule-of-thirds placement
- **Spatial Allocation:** Head 30-40% of frame, shoulders 15-25%, negative space 50-70%
- **Background Treatment:** Minimal, neutral tonal wash; seamless studio or simple natural; <5% detail
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 portrait ratio creates intimate psychological space characteristic of Lindbergh's editorial work; tight framing emphasizes facial character and expression

**Commercial Campaign Mode (4:3 primary; 16:9 secondary):**
- **Ratio Status:** Native support
- **Reframing Method:** Landscape orientation; subject left/right third or center
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject 30-40% of frame, environmental context 20-30%, negative space 30-40%
- **Background Treatment:** Slightly more context than Editorial (industrial setting, luxury brand environment, or neutral expanse); still minimal detail
- **Format Justification:** Landscape ratio accommodates brand context while maintaining Lindbergh's humanist focus; subject remains primary but environment becomes supporting narrative

**Fine Art Portrait Mode (1:1):**
- **Ratio Status:** Native support
- **Reframing Method:** Square composition; centered or slightly off-center; radial balance
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject 40-50% of frame, balanced negative space 50-60%
- **Background Treatment:** High-key neutral background; minimal-to-no environmental detail; emphasis on portrait as autonomous object
- **Format Justification:** Square format emphasizes museum-quality monographic presentation; eliminates directional bias; subject becomes contemplative object of pure aesthetic attention

**Mode-Specific Ratio Allocation:**
- Editorial Portrait = 3:4 ONLY
- Commercial Campaign = 4:3 primary OR 16:9 secondary (specify in prompt)
- Fine Art Portrait = 1:1 ONLY

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Historical Context:**

Peter Lindbergh (1944-2019) revolutionized fashion photography through **anti-retouching philosophy** during an era obsessed with artificial perfection. His breakthrough came in 1978 when he moved to Paris as a *Vogue* contributor; his defining moment arrived in 1990 with an unretouched Vogue cover featuring five supermodels—sparking the supermodel era and proving authenticity could define beauty.

**Active Period:** 1973-2019 (primary recognition 1978-2010s)

**Artistic Influences:**
- Early painting studies at Berlin Academy of Fine Arts (critical eye for composition and form)
- Van Gogh (emotional intensity, color-to-value translation)
- Humanist photojournalism (Cartier-Bresson influence, decisive moment)
- Anti-commercial art movement (rejection of artificial perfection)

**Medium/Production Method:**

**Film to Print Workflow (Analogue Darkroom):**
- **Capture:** Medium-format (Hasselblad, Contax 645) or large-format (Sinar) for studio; 35mm (Leica) for dynamic moments
- **Film Stock:** Kodak Tri-X 400 (signature grain, tonal range, pushed/pulled for contrast control)
- **Development:** Kodak D-76 or Ilford ID-11 (precise chemistry, consistent grain signature)
- **Printing:** Baryta-based gelatin silver paper (Ilford Multigrade FB, Foma FOMABROM); matte finish
- **Darkroom Technique:** Dodging (lighten highlights), burning (deepen shadows), selective bleaching (if needed); minimal spot removal only
- **NO Digital Retouching:** Wrinkles preserved, age marks honored, character details protected

**Thematic Purpose:**

Lindbergh's work serves **psychological portraiture**—revealing subject's inner life, character, emotional depth—rather than commercial beauty display. Every photograph asks: "Who is this person, stripped of artifice?"

**5 Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Wrinkle Preservation** — Age marks visible, character lines prominent, NO smoothing (L deviation ±0% tolerance—authentic surface required)
2. **Ultra-Soft Lighting** — Diffused single-source, minimal shadows, edge softness coefficient 0.97+ (sfumato-like gradations)
3. **Tight Intimate Framing** — Subject 25-45% of frame, breathing room 50-70%, psychological distance created through composition
4. **Deep Black Tones** — Shadow floor L=5-20% (embracing blacks deliberately), not light-flooded safety
5. **Direct Psychological Gaze** — Eyes engage viewer, expression contemplative/introspective, viewer confronts subject's humanity

**Production Era Authenticity:**

Lindbergh's working period (1978-2019) predates digital photography dominance; his finest prints remain analogue darkroom work. Framework enforces **film-era characteristics:**
- **Film grain signature:** Kodak Tri-X visible organic grain, NOT artificial digital noise
- **Paper surface:** Baryta paper matte finish, smooth whites (L=220-236%), deep blacks (L=5-20%), archival quality
- **Dodging/Burning Evidence:** Subtle tonal management visible as refined transitions, NOT crude vignetting
- **Print Quality:** Museum-archival standard, no degradation

**Tone Tag:** Humanist authenticity; psychological intensity; emotional truth over commercial beauty

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

### EDITORIAL PORTRAIT MODE

#### Context
Editorial portraits represent Lindbergh's magazine work—single subject, direct engagement, dramatic lighting that reveals character. Fashion editorials (Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair) required subjects capable of conveying narrative within a single frame. Lighting is theatrical but never artificial; shadows define form as much as highlights. The goal: psychological intensity over glamour.

#### Measurements
- **Face Region Luminance:** L=78-130% (wide range reflecting subject skin tone and lighting mood)
- **Shadow Floor:** L=5-14% (dramatically dark, embracing blacks intentionally)
- **Highlight Ceiling:** L=220-236% (baryta paper white with subtle rolloff)
- **Key-to-Fill Lighting Ratio:** 4:1 to 6:1 (dramatic shadow separation)
- **Edge Softness Coefficient:** 0.96-0.98 (ultra-soft sfumato gradations)
- **Subject Framing:** 25-40% of frame height (tight intimate scale)
- **Negative Space:** 60-70% of frame (psychological breathing room)
- **Head-to-Body Ratio:** 1:7.5 (standard adult proportions, no elongation)
- **Eye Scale:** 25-28% of face width (alert, engaged expression)
- **Tonal Step Count:** 6-8 distinct zones (smooth gradation without posterization)
- **Background Detail Density:** <5% of frame (minimal, seamless, studio-standard)

#### Technique
- **Camera Format:** Medium format (Hasselblad, Contax 645) for portrait resolution; large format (Sinar) optional for maximum detail and tonal control
- **Film Stock:** Kodak Tri-X 400, rated at box speed or pushed to 800 ISO for increased grain and contrast
- **Lighting Setup:** Single large softbox (Para 177 equivalent, ~1.5m width) positioned frontal at 0-15° angle to camera axis; minimal fill light (reflector only, no additional strobes)
- **Lighting Distance:** 1.5-2.5m from subject (creates soft edge transitions characteristic of Lindbergh's work)
- **Key Light Intensity:** 1500-1800 lux (studio standard, bright enough to penetrate to shadow depths)
- **Fill Light Method:** White or silver reflector positioned low camera-right; subtle bounce only (no powered fill light source)
- **Background:** Seamless paper or muslin, neutral gray/beige, positioned 1.5-2m behind subject to prevent shadow on background
- **Exposure:** Slight overexposure of key light (±1/3 stop) to push highlights into paper white zone while maintaining shadow separation
- **Development:** Standard Kodak D-76 or Ilford ID-11 at 20°C for 12-15 minutes (achieves classic Tri-X tonal range and grain signature)
- **Printing:** Baryta paper (Ilford Multigrade FB or Foma FOMABROM), grade 2-3 (middle grades avoid excessive contrast)
- **Darkroom Technique:**
  - **Dodging (lighten):** Eyes, bridge of nose, cheekbones—0.5-1.0 second per pass, feathered tool motion
  - **Burning (darken):** Shadow side of face, neck-to-shoulder transition—0.5-1.5 second per pass, controlled aperture
  - **NO spotting/cloning:** Maintain wrinkles, age marks, skin texture as-is
  - **Toning (optional):** Slight selenium toning to enhance blacks and add archival stability (NOT color toning)
- **Print Surface:** Matte finish ONLY (no gloss, no semi-gloss); drymount to archival board if exhibition-quality

#### Validation
- Shadow floor achieves L≥5% minimum (avoid pure black crush)
- Highlight ceiling achieves L≤236% (baryta paper ceiling respected)
- Face region luminance L∈[78-130%] per subject
- Edge softness coefficient ≥0.96 (confirm sfumato-like gradations)
- Wrinkles/age marks VISIBLE and PRESERVED (anti-retouching mandate enforced)
- Tonal zones 6-8 distinct steps (no banding, no posterization)
- Subject framing 25-40% of frame (intimate scale achieved)
- Background seamless and detail-free (<5% detail)
- Kodak Tri-X grain visible at 1:1 print scale (organic, not artificial)
- No digital smoothing signature, no beauty-mode defaults

#### Automated Corrections
- If shadow floor <5%: Increase key light intensity +200 lux, pull back reflector 0.5m
- If highlight ceiling >240%: Reduce exposure -0.25 stop, increase fill light (reflector closer)
- If edge softness <0.95: Move softbox closer to subject (reduce distance by 0.5m), increase diffusion
- If wrinkles/marks appear smoothed: CRITICAL FAILURE—regenerate without beauty filters

---

### COMMERCIAL CAMPAIGN MODE

#### Context
Commercial campaigns (luxury brands: Dior, David Yurman, IWC, etc.) required Lindbergh to balance brand aesthetics with his humanist philosophy. Campaigns are softer-lit than editorial, with more environmental context and less dramatic shadow work. Subjects must convey sophistication and accessibility simultaneously—aspirational but relatable. Lighting is still dramatic but less theatrical than editorial.

#### Measurements
- **Face Region Luminance:** L=89-150% (brighter overall, less dramatic shadow work)
- **Shadow Floor:** L=15-30% (softer shadows, more ambient fill)
- **Highlight Ceiling:** L=220-236% (baryta paper white, consistent with editorial)
- **Key-to-Fill Lighting Ratio:** 2:1 to 4:1 (balanced but still dramatic)
- **Edge Softness Coefficient:** 0.95-0.97 (soft but slightly more definition than editorial)
- **Subject Framing:** 25-45% of frame (tight to moderate, depends on brand context)
- **Negative Space:** 40-65% of frame (more context than editorial allows)
- **Background Detail Density:** 5-15% of frame (slightly more environmental narrative)
- **Head-to-Body Ratio:** 1:7.5 (standard proportions maintained)
- **Tonal Step Count:** 6-9 distinct zones (smooth gradation, allows for environmental tones)
- **Composition Grid:** Rule of thirds or centered, depending on brand layout

#### Technique
- **Camera Format:** Medium format (Hasselblad, Contax 645) for campaigns; large format (Sinar) for product-adjacent work
- **Film Stock:** Kodak Tri-X 400 at box speed or -1 stop (slight underexposure for richer midtones in commercial contexts)
- **Lighting Setup:** Single large softbox (Para 222 equivalent, ~1.8m width) positioned frontal-to-slightly-elevated; additional reflector (white, positioned low camera-right) provides fill light
- **Lighting Distance:** 2-3m from subject (creates more ambient light at shadow floor)
- **Key Light Intensity:** 1200-1500 lux (slightly lower than editorial to prevent harsh contrast)
- **Fill Light Method:** White or silver reflector positioned at 45° angle to camera-left; active bounce to reduce shadow ratio
- **Background:** Varied per brand—seamless paper (neutral), industrial/urban setting (location shoot), or luxury interior (product-adjacent)
- **Exposure:** Standard exposure (±0 stop), slight latitude for underexposure to control highlights
- **Development:** Kodak D-76 at 20°C for 12-14 minutes (slightly shorter to maintain midtone separation)
- **Printing:** Baryta paper grade 2 (ensure midtone richness for environmental context)
- **Darkroom Technique:**
  - **Dodging:** Eyes, cheekbones, product highlight points (if product present)—light touch to maintain brand sophistication
  - **Burning:** Shadow-side face if needed; background tone management to balance environmental narrative
  - **Toning:** Slight warm tone (subtle gold/sepia) optional to enhance commercial appeal—NOT excessive color
- **Print Surface:** Matte finish, drymount optional (depends on brand presentation standards)

#### Validation
- Shadow floor L∈[15-30%] (softer but still dramatic)
- Face luminance L∈[89-150%] per subject and lighting mood
- Edge softness ≥0.95 (soft gradations maintained)
- Background achieves 5-15% detail density (environmental context present but not dominant)
- Wrinkles/marks visible (anti-retouching mandate enforced)
- Tonal zones 6-9 distinct steps (allows for environmental richness)
- Subject framing 25-45% of frame
- Kodak Tri-X grain organic and visible

#### Automated Corrections
- If shadow floor <15%: Increase fill light (move reflector closer or add secondary reflector)
- If face luminance <89%: Increase key light intensity +200 lux or reduce exposure -0.25 stop
- If background too sparse: Add subtle environmental element (industrial corner, luxury interior hint)
- If brand aesthetic not apparent: Regenerate with lighting slight warm tone (Lindbergh rarely used color toning, but commercial requires subtle warmth)

### FINE ART PORTRAIT MODE

#### Context
Fine art portraits represent Lindbergh's monographic work—museum-quality prints intended as autonomous aesthetic objects. These are his most experimental, often featuring extremely soft lighting and high-key backgrounds that approach the realm of abstraction. The subject becomes almost a sculptural form emerging from neutral space. Fine art portraits embrace silence and introspection; they are NOT commercial, NOT narrative-driven. They are pure psychological portraiture.

#### Measurements
- **Face Region Luminance:** L=150-180% (very high-key, bright and luminous)
- **Shadow Floor:** L=40-80% (very soft, barely any shadow; almost diffuse)
- **Highlight Ceiling:** L=220-236% (consistent baryta paper standard)
- **Key-to-Fill Lighting Ratio:** 1:1 to 2:1 (nearly diffuse, barely any separation)
- **Edge Softness Coefficient:** 0.97-0.99+ (MAXIMUM softness, approaching complete diffusion)
- **Subject Framing:** 35-50% of frame (slightly larger to command attention in high-key environment)
- **Negative Space:** 50-65% of frame (contemplative breathing room)
- **Background Luminance:** L=150-180% (nearly identical to face luminance, high-key white/light gray)
- **Background Detail Density:** <2% of frame (virtually seamless, pure light)
- **Tonal Step Count:** 3-5 distinct zones (compressed, almost monochromatic; subject emerges from white)
- **Composition Grid:** Centered or slightly off-center; radial balance in square format

#### Technique
- **Camera Format:** Large format (Sinar F or P series) for maximum resolution and tonal control; medium format acceptable
- **Film Stock:** Kodak Tri-X 400 at -1 stop (slight underexposure to compress tonal range and force high-key aesthetic)
- **Lighting Setup:** Extremely diffused setup—two large softboxes (Para 222 or larger) positioned on either side of subject at 45° angles, OR single massive diffusion panel (overhead scrim) with diffuse window light
- **Lighting Distance:** 2.5-3.5m from subject (maximize diffusion, minimize shadow definition)
- **Key Light Intensity:** 800-1000 lux (deliberately low to force high-key output)
- **Fill Light Method:** Both lights equal intensity (1:1 ratio), or overhead scrim with continuous LED panel
- **Background:** Seamless white paper positioned directly behind subject, or white studio wall; no distance separation
- **Exposure:** Deliberate OVEREXPOSURE (+0.5 to +1.0 stop) to blow highlights into paper white and force subject to emerge from luminosity
- **Development:** Kodak D-76 at 20°C for 10-12 minutes (shortened to reduce contrast and compress shadows)
- **Printing:** Baryta paper grade 1 or soft (low contrast; subject barely separates from white background)
- **Darkroom Technique:**
  - **Dodging:** Minimal—allow highlight bloom to dominate
  - **Burning:** Selective shadow enhancement only if subject completely dissolves (rarely needed)
  - **Toning:** Possible warm tone (very subtle gold) to add archival quality—NOT color toning
- **Print Surface:** Matte finish, drymount to heavy archival board (suggests sculpture/object quality)

#### Validation
- Face luminance L∈[150-180%] (high-key confirmed)
- Shadow floor L≥40% (barely any shadow; diffuse aesthetic achieved)
- Background luminance L∈[150-180%] (high-key background matches face)
- Edge softness ≥0.98 (maximum softness, sfumato to abstraction boundary)
- Subject emerges from white (composition creates sense of subject as object)
- Tonal zones 3-5 only (compression confirms high-key aesthetic)
- Wrinkles/marks visible but softened by lighting (anti-retouching still enforced, but light compression emphasizes form)
- Kodak Tri-X grain visible but compressed (organic grain maintains authenticity even in high-key)
- Subject framing 35-50% of frame (sufficient presence in centered composition)

#### Automated Corrections
- If shadow floor <40%: Reduce key light intensity by 300 lux, increase fill light
- If background <150%: Increase background luminance (expose longer, or move background closer to light sources)
- If edge softness <0.97: Add secondary diffusion layer, increase scrim/softbox size
- If subject too compressed/invisible: Slight selective burning on subject shadow side (but maintain overall high-key aesthetic)

### HAIR TREATMENT - MANDATORY PRESERVATION AND PERIOD ADAPTATION

**CRITICAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:**

- ✓ **Hair length MUST be preserved:** Short hair remains short, medium remains medium, long remains long
- ✓ **Hair color MUST be preserved:** Natural hair color maintained exactly
- ✓ **Baldness MUST be preserved:** Bald or balding subjects remain bald/balding in period-appropriate manner
- ✓ **Facial hair presence MUST be preserved:** Clean-shaven subjects remain clean-shaven; bearded subjects maintain beards

**PERIOD STYLING ADAPTATION (Preserving length/color/presence):**

Modern hairstyles must be restyled to 1980s-2010s conventions WHILE maintaining original length.

**Short Hair (preserved length):**
- **Female:** Minimal era-specific styling; maintain length but restyle to 1990s-2000s minimal cuts (no contemporary undercuts, no modern layering; simple bob or cropped style acceptable)
- **Male:** Natural short hair, period-appropriate grooming (no contemporary fades or undercuts; simple tapered cut acceptable)

**Medium Hair (preserved length):**
- **Female:** Restyle to period shoulder-length styles (1990s-2000s waves, minimal contemporary volume; no Instagram-era overstyling)
- **Male:** Collar-length or shorter, natural waves/slight curl acceptable

**Long Hair (preserved length):**
- **Female:** Restyle to period long-hair styling (straight or natural waves, 1990s-2010s aesthetic; no contemporary extensions visible, no modern highlights/balayage)
- **Male:** Rare; if present, maintain length but restyle away from contemporary man-bun aesthetic

**Bald/Balding (preserved condition):**
- **All subjects:** Natural appearance maintained; no synthetic hair added; period-appropriate grooming of remaining hair if present

**Facial Hair (preserved presence):**
- **Clean-shaven default:** Maintain clean-shaven appearance; period grooming without modern bristle patterns
- **Bearded subjects:** Maintain beard; style to period conventions (1990s-2000s beards were fuller and less shaped than contemporary; avoid contemporary beard oil sheen or precise line-work)
- **Never add facial hair if subject is naturally clean-shaven**
- **Never remove facial hair if subject has natural beard**

### MODE-SPECIFIC GENDER-DIFFERENTIATED PROP POOLS

**EDITORIAL PORTRAIT MODE**

**Male Props:**
- Leather-bound book or notebook (intellectual context)
- Vintage camera or photography equipment (artistic context)
- Simple pen or writing instrument
- Minimal: subject typically frameless, no props

**Female Props:**
- Flower (single bloom, minimal ornamentation)
- Book or literary context (intellectual framing)
- Simple scarf or textile element
- Minimal: subject typically frameless, no props

**Micro Props (both genders):**
- Simple watch (barely visible)
- Single ring or minimal jewelry
- Implied props only (hand positioning suggests held object not shown)
- Lindbergh rarely used props; background engagement more important than object manipulation

**Temporal Notes:** Editorial mode emphasizes subject, not context. Lindbergh's portraits are about psychological intensity, not narrative staging. Props are exceptions, not default.

**COMMERCIAL CAMPAIGN MODE**

**Male Props:**
- Luxury watch or timepiece (brand-adjacent: IWC, David Yurman aesthetic)
- Luxury accessory (scarf, minimal jewelry, brand-appropriate)
- Product reference if brand campaign (held subtly, not prominently)
- Environmental props (luxury interior element, professional context hint)

**Female Props:**
- Luxury jewelry or accessory (brand-adjacent)
- Refined textile element (luxury scarf, subtle pattern)
- Product reference if applicable (jewelry, watch, brand-specific item)
- Environmental props (luxury interior, brand context suggestion)

**Micro Props (both genders):**
- Luxury watch or timepiece
- Single piece of jewelry (brand-appropriate sophistication)
- Hand positioning to suggest brand connection (subtle, not obvious)

**Temporal Notes:** Commercial campaigns allow more prop engagement than editorial. Props signal brand luxury and sophistication. Lindbergh's campaigns maintained humanist philosophy while accommodating brand requirements; props remain subtle, never dominating the subject.

**FINE ART PORTRAIT MODE**

**Male Props:** MINIMAL or ABSENT
- Subject typically frameless, alone
- Rare: implied hand object or minimal gesture
- No explicit props

**Female Props:** MINIMAL or ABSENT
- Subject typically frameless, alone
- Rare: simple textile or minimal object
- No explicit props

**Micro Props (both genders):** ABSENT
- Fine art portraits transcend objects
- Focus pure on psychological presence and facial character

**Temporal Notes:** Fine art portraits are autonomous objects; props distract from pure portraiture. Lindbergh's monographic work embraced silence and introspection; subjects emerge from neutral space without external reference.

### SETTING AUTHENTICITY

**Editorial Portrait Mode:**
- **Studio Standard:** Seamless paper background, gray/beige neutral tone (L=80-120%)
- **Alternative:** Simple natural light (overcast window, minimal environmental detail visible)
- **Principle:** Background recedes; subject dominates

**Commercial Campaign Mode:**
- **Studio with Context:** Seamless background with subtle environmental hint (industrial corner, luxury interior edge, brand-appropriate setting)
- **Location Shoot:** Luxury hotel, brand headquarters, upscale urban environment; minimal background detail, subject still dominates
- **Principle:** Background supports brand narrative; subject remains primary

**Fine Art Portrait Mode:**
- **Pure Studio:** High-key white/light background, seamless, no environmental reference
- **Alternative:** Neutral institutional setting (gallery wall, museum neutrals)
- **Principle:** Background becomes pure light and space; subject emerging from white

**Coherence Filter:** All setting elements support declared mode and brand aesthetic. When uncertain about temporal accuracy or appropriateness, OMIT rather than risk anachronism.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

### RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (Final Ratio - Native Support)

**EDITORIAL PORTRAIT MODE (3:4 primary ratio)**

**Vertical Emphasis & Subject Dominance:**
- **Figure Prominence:** Subject 25-40% of frame height (tight intimate scale)
- **Head-to-Shoulders:** Head 30-35% of frame, shoulders 10-15%, negative space 50-70%
- **Vertical Flow:** Subject positioned upper-middle or upper-third of frame (psychological weight upward)
- **Aspect Utilization:** Vertical orientation emphasizes facial character; portrait ratio creates contemplative psychological space
- **Compositional Grid:** Rule of thirds (head positioned at upper intersection), or centered with offset shoulders
- **Negative Space Zones:** Lower two-thirds of frame typically negative space (breathing room, psychological distance)
- **Framing Edges:** Subject rarely touches frame edge; margin 5-10% on all sides

**COMMERCIAL CAMPAIGN MODE (4:3 primary; 16:9 secondary)**

**Horizontal Flow & Environmental Balance:**
- **Figure Prominence:** Subject 25-45% of frame (moderate framing allows brand context)
- **Head-to-Torso:** Head 25-30%, shoulders and upper torso 20-30%, environment 20-40%, negative space 30-40%
- **Horizontal Spread:** Landscape orientation allows side-to-side visual movement; subject typically left-third, center, or right-third (rule of thirds secondary to directional flow)
- **Aspect Utilization:** 4:3 ratio balanced between figure and environment; 16:9 allows cinematic sweep while maintaining portrait integrity
- **Compositional Grid:** Off-center subject with environmental context balancing opposite side
- **Negative Space Zones:** Right or left of subject as brand-context area; above/below as graduated transition
- **Framing Edges:** Subject chest/torso may reach lower frame; head typically 10-15% from top

**FINE ART PORTRAIT MODE (1:1 square primary)**

**Radial Balance & Contemplative Centering:**
- **Figure Prominence:** Subject 40-50% of frame (sufficient presence commands attention)
- **Head Centering:** Head positioned center or slightly offset (radial balance, no directional bias)
- **Body Visibility:** Full-shoulder or partial-torso visible; equal negative space on all sides
- **Aspect Utilization:** Square format eliminates horizontal/vertical bias; subject becomes autonomous aesthetic object
- **Compositional Grid:** Centered primary; optional concentric circle implied through radial composition
- **Negative Space Zones:** Equal breathing room top/bottom/sides (typically 50-60% negative space total)
- **Framing Edges:** Subject typically 10% margin from frame edge on all sides; no edge-touching

---

### STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (Mode-Differentiated)

**EDITORIAL PORTRAIT MODE - Composition:**

**Illustrated/Photographic Composition:**
- **Perspective Regime:** Flat picture plane (minimal atmospheric depth); subject appears sculptural against neutral background
- **Grid/Symmetry:** Asymmetrical balance with psychological weight; frontal or 3/4 orientation
- **Figure:Ground Ratio:** 25-40% subject, 60-75% negative space (breathing room creates psychological distance)
- **Density:** Sparse (minimal background detail <5%); subject clarity paramount
- **Lighting Logic:** Frontal 0-15° key light creates dimensional form without atmospheric depth
- **Detail:Negative Space:** High detail on face/expression, zero detail on background (focus contrast)

**COMMERCIAL CAMPAIGN MODE - Composition:**

**Illustrated/Photographic Composition:**
- **Perspective Regime:** Slightly atmospheric; background provides brand context hint (industrial corner, luxury interior edge)
- **Grid/Symmetry:** Asymmetrical; subject positioned strong rule-of-thirds or center-weighted toward brand context
- **Figure:Ground Ratio:** 25-45% subject, 25-40% brand context, 20-40% negative space
- **Density:** Moderate (5-15% background detail); environmental narrative supports subject
- **Lighting Logic:** Frontal to slightly elevated key light; fill light ratio 2:1-4:1 reveals environmental context
- **Detail:Negative Space:** High face detail, subtle background texture (environmental storytelling)

**FINE ART PORTRAIT MODE - Composition:**

**Illustrated/Photographic Composition:**
- **Perspective Regime:** Pure flat picture plane; background becomes luminous space, not depicted environment
- **Grid/Symmetry:** Centered or concentric; radial balance (no directional emphasis)
- **Figure:Ground Ratio:** 40-50% subject, 50-60% high-key negative space (luminous surround)
- **Density:** Nearly empty (<2% detail); pure focus on subject as object
- **Lighting Logic:** Diffuse 1:1-2:1 ratio; minimal shadows; subject emerges from white light
- **Detail:Negative Space:** Maximum face detail in minimal setting (contrast creates presence)

---

### UNIVERSAL COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS

**Surface Context Anchor:** 
- **Editorial:** Studio seamless background (baryta paper equivalent, L=80-120%, neutral gray/beige)
- **Commercial:** Studio with subtle context OR location (brand-appropriate, minimal background detail)
- **Fine Art:** Pure high-key white/light background (L=150-180%, luminous surround)

**Frame/Band Anchor:** 
- **Omitted entirely.** Lindbergh's portraits are clean canvas edges; no frame, border, or decorative band. Photography format transcends frame tradition.

**Production Context Anchor:** 
- **Medium Format Photography:** Hasselblad/Contax 645 or large format (Sinar); Kodak Tri-X 400 film
- **Printing:** Baryta-based gelatin silver paper, matte finish
- **Darkroom Technique:** Dodging/burning selective tonal management; minimal spot removal only
- **No Digital Post-Processing** beyond scanning for archive

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** 
- Composition designed SPECIFICALLY for final declared ratio (3:4 Editorial, 4:3 Commercial, 1:1 Fine Art)
- Not adapted from different format; native composition for chosen ratio
- Spatial organization optimized for aspect ratio's proportional characteristics

**Gender Expression Anchor:** 
- Pose and styling convey subject's presented gender identity using period-contemporary conventions (1980s-2010s)
- Cross-mode consistency: same subject maintains identical gender presentation in Editorial/Commercial/Fine Art (only lighting/framing changes)
- Facial hair/grooming/wardrobe all support gender authenticity

**Mode-Specific Composition Anchor:** 
- **Editorial Portrait:** Dramatic lighting + tight framing + psychological intensity
- **Commercial Campaign:** Balanced lighting + moderate framing + brand context integration
- **Fine Art Portrait:** Diffuse lighting + contemplative centering + autonomous object quality

**Composition Principles (Universal):**
- **Rule of Thirds:** Primary compositional structure (head at upper-third intersection typical)
- **Negative Space:** 50-70% of frame (psychological breathing room)
- **Subject Framing:** 25-50% of frame depending on mode (tight Editorial, moderate Commercial, prominent Fine Art)
- **Background Minimalism:** <15% detail density (focus contrast on face/character)
- **Asymmetrical Balance:** Psychological weight through lighting and expression, not geometric symmetry
- **Flat Picture Plane:** Minimal atmospheric recession; subject appears sculptural

---

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**BINARY TEXT POLICY: OMIT ENTIRELY**

Lindbergh's photographic works contain **NO typography, text, captions, or titling**. Photographs are autonomous visual objects intended to speak through image alone.

**Rationale:** Lindbergh's philosophy emphasized direct subject engagement without verbal mediation. Text would contradict the humanist authenticity that defines his work.

**Implementation:** All generated images must be text-free, clean canvas edge to edge.
