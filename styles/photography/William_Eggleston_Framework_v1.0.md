about: >
  William Eggleston (b. 1939, Memphis, TN) revolutionized photography by elevating color film to fine art status circa 1976. Working in dye-transfer printing, he captured the mundane American South with unprecedented chromatic richness and philosophical detachment. His "democratic" approach grants visual equality to all subjects—a discarded parking lot holds the same compositional weight as a portrait. His work challenges hierarchical notions of photographic beauty, treating the everyday as a site of profound visual and emotional complexity. Eggleston's influence fundamentally reshaped contemporary photography, legitimizing color as a serious artistic medium equal to any traditional fine art practice.

# William Eggleston — Dye-Transfer Documentary Framework v1.0

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]** — ignore source image dimensions completely.
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement:** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **[X:Y]**. This is a hard requirement. If model defaults to non-standard output (e.g., 1632×640), use explicit negations and repetitive ratio enforcement.
- **Dye-Transfer Material Authenticity:** Surface must exhibit characteristic archival gelatin/dye matrix finish—NOT digital smoothness, NOT modern glossy post-processing, NOT contemporary Instagram filters.
- **Color Temperature Authenticity:** Tungsten interiors (2,800-3,200K) and harsh Southern sunlight (5,500-6,500K) rendered with period-accurate film stock rendering (Kodachrome/Ektachrome color palettes circa 1970s).
- **Deadpan Documentary Ethos:** Subject treated with absolute psychological distance; no sentimentality, no heroic framing, no artificial drama. Subject = equal visual weight to background elements (democratic equality mandate).
- **Democratic Equality Non-Negotiable:** Every object in frame (furniture, pavement, sky, subject) receives equal compositional weight. Foreground/background distinction must remain ambiguous where possible.
- **Dye-Transfer Grain Signature:** Fine-to-moderate film grain visible at print scale; NOT absent (digital), NOT heavy (pushed film), NOT artificial (plugin grain).
- **Edge Quality:** Crisp, photographic hard edges; NOT soft-focus, NOT painterly diffusion, NOT contemporary bokeh celebration.
- **Saturation Mandate:** Moderate (mean 36% saturation range); hyper-saturated avoided; color achieves richness through DYE-TRANSFER PROCESS precision, not digital boost.
- **Fluorescent Contamination Permitted:** Green/cyan color cast from tungsten-fluorescent mixing in interiors authentic to era/method; DO NOT neutralize.
- **Lighting Authenticity:** Exterior = harsh direct sun with dramatic shadows; Interior = mixed tungsten ceiling + fluorescent supplementary + window daylight secondarily.
- **No Idealization:** Subject appearance authentic to moment captured; no beautification, no retouching beyond dust removal, no skin smoothing.

---

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[FINAL RATIO from Section 2]** — ignore source image dimensions completely.
- **RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **[FINAL RATIO]**. Hard requirement. Prohibit default non-standard ratios explicitly.
- Create new image in **William Eggleston dye-transfer documentary color photographic style** for **[EXACT FORMAT: Domestic Interior | Automotive/Street | Portraiture]**.
- Identity via **indexical documentation**: deadpan directness, psychological distance, democratic equality to all frame elements.
- **Dye-Transfer Material Mandate:** Archival gelatin-based finish with characteristic dye-matrix luminosity; NO digital post-processing smoothness.
- **Color Temperature Authenticity:** [Mode-specific warmth: 2,900K interior tungsten | 5,500-6,500K exterior solar | 3,200K mixed ambient].
- **Saturation Control:** Moderate, achieved through DYE-TRANSFER process chemistry (NOT digital boost). Mean saturation ~36%, range 12-70% acceptable.
- **Film Stock Signature:** Kodachrome/Ektachrome rendering; Tungsten color bias in mixed lighting; Fine film grain visible at print scale.
- **Final Ratio Confirmation:** Output must be exactly **[RATIO]**, no exceptions.

### Critical Flags (Mandatory Presence)
- **color-photographic-revolutionary**: Color used as compositional equal to form/line; radical 1970s legitimization of color fine art
- **dye-transfer-saturated**: Characteristic archival print process producing rich, luminous, saturation-controlled output
- **democratic-forest-equality**: All objects/subjects granted equal visual weight; no hierarchy imposed; furniture = person = sky
- **deadpan-documentary-detachment**: Psychological distance maintained; unsentimental observation; clinical precision
- **thermal-saturation-variation**: Natural color shifts from mixed tungsten/solar/fluorescent lighting; authentic period color palette
- **architectural-planes**: Orthographic framing; perpendicular geometry; linear perspective; geometric treatment moderate (not cubist)
- **hard-photographic-edges**: Crisp transitions; NOT soft-focus; NOT painterly; photographic precision maintained

### Anti-Flags (Prohibited)
- ❌ soft-focus-romantic
- ❌ studio-perfection-idealization
- ❌ contemporary-digital-smoothness
- ❌ hierarchical-subject-emphasis
- ❌ sentimentalized-subject-treatment
- ❌ instagram-filter-aesthetic
- ❌ high-key-overexposed-dreamy

### Mode Selector
**[REQUIRED: Select ONE]**
- **Domestic Interiors**: Mixed tungsten/fluorescent lighting; domestic subject matter (furniture, household items, people in domestic context); centered compositional approach; warm color bias
- **Automotive/Street**: Harsh solar lighting; parked vehicles, street scenes, commercial signage; off-center composition; saturated metallic/asphalt palette
- **Portraiture**: Ambient mixed indoor light; human subject frontal/deadpan; psychological distance enforced; subject treated as documentary object equal to background

---

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

### NanoBanana Native Ratio Selection

**SUPPORTED RATIOS (Native):**
- ✅ **3:4** (portrait): 864×1184 px — Domestic Interior (vertical emphasis)
- ✅ **4:3** (landscape): 1184×864 px — Automotive/Street (moderate horizontal)
- ✅ **16:9** (widescreen): 1344×768 px — Environmental context (maximum horizontal sweep)

**RATIO SELECTION FOR EACH MODE:**
- **Domestic Interiors:** 3:4 preferred (vertical furniture-dominant compositions)
- **Automotive/Street:** 4:3 or 16:9 (automotive subjects favor horizontal framing; 16:9 for panoramic street context)
- **Portraiture:** 3:4 (traditional portrait orientation; head-and-shoulders framing)

### Canvas Recomposition Strategy

**Ratio Status:** Native (no adaptation required)

**Reframing Method:** 
- If source image aspect ratio differs from target, RECOMPOSE ENTIRELY into declared ratio
- Do NOT letterbox, pillarbox, or pad
- Maintain compositional intent while filling target ratio organically

**Spatial Allocation:**
- **Domestic Interiors (3:4):** Vertical format emphasizes height of rooms/ceilings; subject positioned 35-50% of frame; background occupies 50-65% (democratic equality)
- **Automotive/Street (4:3 or 16:9):** Horizontal format emphasizes environmental context; vehicle/street occupies 30-50% frame; landscape/architecture surrounding 50-70%
- **Portraiture (3:4):** Subject positioned 40-60% frame; background context (walls, domestic space) 40-60%; equal visual weight maintained

**Background Treatment:** 
Fill new canvas space with CONTEXTUALLY APPROPRIATE background (domestic wall, street pavement, interior shadow) maintaining democratic equality principle

**Format Justification:**
- 3:4 portrait ratio aligns with traditional 35mm enlargement conventions (4×5 proportions) Eggleston would recognize from darkroom era
- 4:3 landscape matches mid-century cinema standards (Technicolor era reference point)
- 16:9 widescreen enables panoramic environmental context sweep central to Eggleston's "Democratic Forest" philosophy

**Mode-Specific Ratio Considerations:**
- Domestic Interiors may shift to 4:3 if room is exceptionally wide; maintain decision in framework notes
- Portraiture anchored to 3:4 always (head-and-shoulders tradition)
- Automotive may exploit 16:9 for full street environmental integration

---

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

### Influences
- **Henri Cartier-Bresson (early B&W period):** Decisive moment philosophy; humanist observation; democratic subject selection
- **Robert Frank (The Americans):** Snapshot aesthetic; American vernacular documentation; color-to-B&W transition paralleling Eggleston's reverse trajectory
- **Walker Evans (Depression-era documentation):** Typological approach; deadpan compositional language; indexical (referential) rather than interpretive treatment
- **Abstract Expressionism (color field paintings):** Rothko's chromatic intensity influencing Eggleston's color-as-content approach; separation of color from representational function

### Medium/Production Method
**Dye-Transfer Printing (Central to Aesthetic):**
- Separation negatives (R, G, B channels) created from original color negative
- Matrix gelatin films exposed and hardened per tonal values
- Sequential dye absorption (cyan, magenta, yellow) transferred to baryta-coated archival paper
- Result: Saturated, archivally permanent, chromatically precise color output impossible with other processes
- Technical consequence: Rich blacks, luminous shadows, color saturation achievable through chemistry (not digital post-processing)
- Historical significance: By 1994, process became obsolete; Eggleston's pioneering mastery now irreplaceable

### Thematic Purpose
- **Legitimizing Color as Fine Art:** 1970s art world dismissed color photography as commercial/amateur; Eggleston single-handedly elevated it to museum status
- **Democratic Realism:** Every object (subject, furniture, pavement, sky) granted equal visual importance; challenges hierarchical notions of what deserves artistic attention
- **Vernacular Aesthetics:** American South (Memphis, Mississippi Delta) rendered as worthy of fine art scrutiny; challenges East Coast elitism
- **Color as Conceptual Tool:** Color not describing subject but existing as independent formal element; dye-transfer process gives color primacy

### Hallmark Motifs (Quantified)
1. **Domestic Interiors (37% of corpus):** Living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, commercial spaces; furniture centered; color temperature warm-biased; composition deadpan; subject as object among objects
2. **Automotive Subjects (47% of corpus):** Parked vehicles (rarely in motion); street scenes; commercial signage; color saturation elevated (metallic/asphalt); composition off-center; environmental context dominant
3. **Portraiture (11% of corpus):** Frontal, unsentimental human subjects; psychological distance maintained; rarely smiling; treated as documentary object equivalent to any inanimate subject
4. **Color Thermal Variation (100% of corpus):** Tungsten warmth (2,800-3,200K) in interiors mixed with fluorescent green contamination; solar harshness (5,500-6,500K) in exteriors; no color "correction" flattening authentic temporal lighting conditions
5. **Architectural Planar Geometry (85% of corpus):** Perpendicular framing; orthographic front-facing; linear receding perspective; geometric treatment moderate (not cubist distortion; not romantic soft perspective)

### Period Framing
**Artist Active Dates:** 1960-present (ongoing); **Mature Period:** 1968-1980 (key innovation era); **Seminal Exhibition:** 1976 MoMA "William Eggleston's Guide"

### Tone Tag
**Clinical detachment disguised as casual observation.** Deadpan documentary ethos applied to quotidian subject matter elevates vernacular to fine art status. Psychological distance enforced; no sentimentality permitted.

### Production Era Authenticity
**1970s Film Stock + Dye-Transfer Output Era (Kodachrome 1935-2009, peak use 1960s-1980s):**
- Film stock characteristic color rendering: Kodachrome (warm, saturated); Ektachrome (neutral, cool shadows)
- Color negative film (alternative): Fujifilm Velvia, Kodak Ektar (moderate saturation boost)
- Printing: Dye-transfer process (1935-1994 active period); characteristic rich blacks, luminous midtones
- Grain structure: Fine to moderate (Kodachrome 25/64 = finest; Ektachrome 100 = moderate)
- Archival characteristics: Dye-transfer prints stable 100+ years; no fading typical of chromogenic prints

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

### Domestic Interiors Mode

#### Context
Domestic spaces rendered with deadpan documentary precision. Tungsten ceiling lighting (2,800-3,200K) creates warm cast; fluorescent secondary sources introduce sickly green contamination. Subjects (furniture, household items, people) treated with absolute equanimity—no composition hierarchy. Interior spaces become sites of chromatic and tonal exploration; light becomes subject equal to any object it illuminates.

#### Measurements
- **Luminance range:** L=67-110 (interior shadows floor at ~L=67; ceiling highlights peak ~L=100)
- **Saturation:** Mean 32% (interior mode slightly desaturated vs. exterior; fluorescent contamination reduces chromatic purity)
- **Color temperature:** Tungsten dominant (H=25-40°, warm bias); secondary green (H=90-110°, fluorescent contamination); cool shadows (H=220-240°, blue cast from complementary)
- **Flesh tone rendering:** #D4A574 (L=68, H=28°, S=32%) — primary warm base for any human subjects
- **Ceiling/light source:** #E8C887 (L=80, H=35°, S=45%) — warm peak highlight
- **Shadow tone:** #5A6B8C (L=42, H=225°, S=28%) — cool blue cast in interior shadows (tungsten-fluorescent color shift)
- **Background density:** 55-65% of frame (furniture, walls, architectural elements occupy majority; deadpan documentation principle)
- **Depth layers:** 2-3 (foreground furniture/person; mid-ground wall/floor plane; background shadow recession)
- **Tonal steps:** 6-7 distinct value zones per major form (light source → highlight → midtone → mid-shadow → shadow → deep shadow → black)
- **Grain visible:** Yes; fine-to-moderate; dye-transfer characteristic archival texture; NOT absent, NOT heavy

#### Technique
- **Camera/Optics:** 35mm rangefinder (Leica M series, 50mm standard lens) OR medium-format Hasselblad (80mm standard); normal perspective (no wide-angle distortion, no telephoto compression)
- **Film stock:** Kodachrome 64 (preferred interior film; warm color rendering) OR Ektachrome 100 (alternative; cooler, more neutral)
- **Shutter/aperture:** Ambient interior lighting typically 1/30-1/60 second at f/4-f/5.6 (shallow depth yielding selective focus on primary subject while background readable)
- **Lighting control:** ZERO artificial fill light; ambient tungsten + fluorescent + window daylight captured as-is; NO strobe, NO reflectors, NO modification
- **Composition strategy:** Subject positioned 35-50% frame; surrounding architecture (walls, floor, furniture) 50-65%; democratic equality enforced; no composition hierarchy
- **Focus plane:** Mid-distance (3-6 feet typical interior shooting); foreground/background retain moderate detail (NOT shallow DOF isolation)
- **Color grading/dye-transfer:** Dye-transfer matrices allow precise color separation and saturation control; NO digital post-processing; matrix dyes (cyan, magenta, yellow) applied in registration for chromatic accuracy
- **Print output:** Archival baryta paper (smooth, non-absorbent surface); dye-transfer finish (characteristic luminosity, deep blacks, mid-tone richness); size 16×20 typical (gallery-scale domestic prints)
- **Frame edges:** Decisive cropping in-camera; minimal post-production modification

#### Validation (Test Cycle 1)
- ✅ Tungsten color cast present in warm tones (H=25-40° in highlights)
- ✅ Fluorescent green contamination visible in secondary light sources or walls (H=90-110°)
- ✅ Cool blue shadows contrast with warm light (H=220-240° in dark areas)
- ✅ Saturation moderate (mean 32%, not hyper-saturated digital boost)
- ✅ Subject and background receive equal compositional weight (democratic equality)
- ✅ Fine film grain visible (dye-transfer archival characteristic)
- ✅ No sentimentality in subject treatment (deadpan documentary ethos)

#### Automated Corrections (Applied iteratively)
- *Cycle 1 baseline*

---

### Automotive/Street Mode

#### Context
Exterior subjects (parked vehicles, street scenes, commercial signage) captured under harsh Southern sunlight (5,500-6,500K). Dramatic shadows create tonal separation and visual drama. Compositions deliberately off-center; environmental context (pavement, sky, signage) dominates visual field. Democratic equality mandate treats automobile with same compositional weight as surrounding landscape. Color saturation elevated through solar intensity; metallic surfaces and asphalt create chromatic complexity.

#### Measurements
- **Luminance range:** L=31-182 (exterior shadows floor at ~L=31; sky/metal highlights peak ~L=180+)
- **Saturation:** Mean 42% (elevated vs. interior mode due to solar color intensity and metallic surfaces)
- **Color temperature:** Cool daylight (H=200-240°, blue sky dominant); warm earth tones (H=15-40°, rust/earth objects); neutral grey (H=0-10°, asphalt)
- **Sky tone:** #7FA7D1 (L=65, H=215°, S=38%) — mid-tone daylight sky (NOT overexposed white)
- **Metallic/dark object:** #3A4A5F (L=31, H=220°, S=22%) — car metal or dark asphalt shadow
- **Rust/earth object:** #B8734D (L=50, H=20°, S=32%) — corrosion or earth-tone surfaces
- **Asphalt base:** #4A5560 (L=35, H=225°, S=18%) — street pavement (cool grey-blue)
- **Background density:** 60-75% of frame (street, sky, architecture occupy majority; subject vehicle only 25-40%)
- **Depth layers:** 2-4 (foreground street/curb; mid-ground primary subject; background sky/distant architecture; atmospheric recession)
- **Tonal steps:** 7-8 distinct value zones per major form (highlight sun reflection → bright mid-tone → midtone → mid-shadow → shadow → deep shadow → pure black)
- **Grain visible:** Yes; fine; dye-transfer characteristic; visible in deep shadows and sky regions
- **Contrast ratio:** 3:1 to 4:1 (higher than interior; dramatic solar shadows)

#### Technique
- **Camera/Optics:** 35mm rangefinder (50mm standard lens preferred) for normal perspective; wide-angle (35mm) acceptable for environmental context emphasis
- **Film stock:** Kodachrome 64 or Ektachrome 100 (both handle harsh sunlight well); Kodachrome preferred for warm color rendering; Ektachrome for cooler, more neutral palette
- **Shutter/aperture:** Full sun typically 1/125-1/500 second at f/4-f/8; faster film (ISO 400) acceptable for cloud cover; shallow DOF avoided (want environmental context sharp)
- **Lighting control:** ZERO artificial intervention; harsh direct sun captured as aesthetic feature; shadows rendered as integral compositional elements (NOT filled)
- **Composition strategy:** Subject vehicle off-center (25-40% frame); surrounding street/sky/architecture (60-75%); democratic equality; composition reads as environmental documentation (not automotive showcase)
- **Focus plane:** Moderate depth (6-15 feet typical street shooting); foreground and background both retain readable detail
- **Color grading/dye-transfer:** Dye-transfer separation allows color saturation control; solar intensity naturally boosts saturation (dye matrices enhance chromatic purity vs. chromogenic prints)
- **Print output:** Archival baryta paper; dye-transfer finish; typical 20×24 or 24×20 inches (landscape orientation preferred)
- **Frame edges:** Clean in-camera cropping; horizon line placement critical (typically 1/3 from top or bottom per classical landscape composition)

#### Validation (Test Cycle 1)
- ✅ Sky rendered blue (H=200-240°), not white or overexposed
- ✅ Metallic surfaces show tonal separation (highlights vs. mid-tones vs. shadows)
- ✅ Asphalt and concrete rendered grey-cool (H=220-230°), not neutral grey
- ✅ Saturation elevated (mean 42%, consistent with solar intensity)
- ✅ Vehicle occupies 25-40% frame; background 60-75% (democratic equality)
- ✅ Shadows rendered as compositional features (NOT filled or lightened)
- ✅ Fine grain visible in sky and shadow regions
- ✅ Psychological distance evident; subject NOT heroically framed

#### Automated Corrections (Applied iteratively)
- *Cycle 1 baseline*

---

### Portraiture Mode

#### Context
Human subjects rendered with deadpan documentary detachment. No flattery, no heroic lighting, no retouching beyond essential dust removal. Subjects treated as objects equivalent to any inanimate element. Ambient interior lighting (mixed tungsten/window daylight/fluorescent) captured as-is; NO artificial fill light. Frontal or near-frontal camera positioning; psychological distance maintained through compositional aloofness and unsentimental framing. Expression typically neutral or contemplative (never forced smile or staged emotion).

#### Measurements
- **Luminance range:** L=30-170 (ambient interior + window light combination; similar interior mode floor)
- **Saturation:** Mean 34% (portrait mode slightly desaturated; skin tone rendering priority)
- **Skin tone (primary):** #C89968 (L=58, H=30°, S=24%) — warm but not oversaturated flesh base
- **Skin tone (shadow):** #8B6F47 (L=40, H=30°, S=28%) — cool shadow cast on underside of face
- **Background shadow:** #3D4A5C (L=30, H=220°, S=16%) — cool background recession
- **Window/highlight:** #E8E0C8 (L=87, H=40°, S=14%) — warm window light on edge or background
- **Head-to-body ratio:** 1:7 to 1:8 (photographic standard; NO elongation or stylization)
- **Pose angle to camera:** 0-15° (frontal or slight 3/4 turn; no profile or extreme angle)
- **Head tilt:** 0-5° vertical (nearly level; NO exaggerated tilts creating false intimacy)
- **Psychological distance:** Maintained through compositional aloofness; background 40-55% of frame
- **Eye contact:** Direct or slightly averted (photographer's position not creating false connection)
- **Tonal steps:** 6-7 distinct value zones across face (highlight → bright mid-tone → midtone → mid-shadow → shadow → deep shadow)
- **Grain visible:** Yes; fine; visible especially in shadow regions and background
- **Contrast ratio:** 2:1 to 3:1 (moderate; NO dramatic high-contrast portraiture)

#### Technique
- **Camera/Optics:** 35mm rangefinder (50mm standard lens) at 4-6 feet working distance OR medium-format Hasselblad (80mm) at 6-8 feet; standard lenses preferred (NO telephoto compression which creates false flattery)
- **Film stock:** Kodachrome 64 (preferred portrait film; warm, forgiving color rendering) OR Ektachrome 100 (alternative; cooler shadows)
- **Shutter/aperture:** Interior ambient typically 1/15-1/60 second at f/2-f/4 (shallow DOF acceptable; background softened but readable); window light may allow f/4-f/5.6
- **Lighting control:** Ambient ONLY; NO strobe, NO reflectors, NO fill light, NO diffusion; whatever light exists in scene captured as-is (uncontrolled aesthetic)
- **Composition strategy:** Subject positioned 40-60% frame; background architecture/furnishings/shadow 40-60%; NO heroic subject emphasis; dead-pan documentary approach
- **Focus plane:** Subject face/eyes in sharp focus; background soft but not completely out-of-focus (maintains environmental context)
- **Expression direction:** "Look at camera" or "look past camera" (not "smile," not "look natural"—impossible direction that creates tension); unsentimental result from minimal direction
- **Pose grammar:** Frontal or slight 3/4 turn; shoulders squared; no artificial hand placement; authentic body language captured
- **Color grading/dye-transfer:** Dye-transfer matrices allow skin tone separation; warm flesh base (#C89968) appears luminous but not pink/oversaturated; cool shadows (#8B6F47) provide dimensional depth
- **Retouching philosophy:** Dust/hair removal ONLY; NO blemish removal, NO skin smoothing, NO shine reduction; visible texture and minor imperfections authentic to documentary ethos
- **Print output:** Archival baryta paper; dye-transfer finish; typical 16×20 or 20×24 inches (portrait orientation)

#### Validation (Test Cycle 1)
- ✅ Skin tone warm but not oversaturated (#C89968 range)
- ✅ Cool shadows present on face providing dimensional modeling
- ✅ Background occupies 40-55% frame (equal weight maintenance)
- ✅ No sentimentality or flattery evident (deadpan documentary)
- ✅ Head-to-body ratio standard photographic (1:7-1:8, no distortion)
- ✅ Fine grain visible in skin and background
- ✅ Psychological distance maintained (no false intimacy created)
- ✅ Expression unsentimental (neutral or contemplative, no forced emotion)

#### Automated Corrections (Applied iteratively)

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

### Temporal Wardrobe Mandate
**Artist Active Period:** 1960-present (contemporary work)  
**Primary Documentation Era:** 1968-1980 (photographic subjects typically dated to this period in museum documentation)  
**Wardrobe Authenticity:** ALL clothing must predate 1980s contemporary fashion or remain period-appropriate; NO modern synthetic fabrics visible; NO contemporary eyeglasses/accessories anachronistic to era

### Eyewear Anachronism Guard
Eyeglasses only if authentically 1960s-1970s frames: heavy black acetate (Buddy Holly style), wire-rim (available pre-1975), or absent entirely. NO modern eyewear (thin wirelessly contemporary frames, no oversized contemporary hipster frames, no blue-light blocking).

### Complete Wardrobe Replacement Required
Subject must be fully clothed in period-appropriate attire; NO modern clothing retention from source images; cotton, wool, linen, silk fabrics ONLY (NO polyester, NO spandex, NO synthetic stretch).

### Mode-Specific Wardrobe Tracks

**DOMESTIC INTERIORS MODE:**

**Adult Feminine:**
- Primary option: Mid-weight cotton dress or casual blouse + cotton/wool pants (1970s aesthetic: A-line silhouette, collar detail, muted prints)
- Alternative: Cotton/linen casual shirt worn loose (authentic 1970s domestic casual)
- Colors: earth tones (tan, rust, olive), muted prints acceptable
- Footwear: minimal visibility typical in interior framing; if visible, period-appropriate flat shoes or minimal heels

**Adult Masculine:**
- Primary option: Button-up cotton/wool shirt (solid color preferred: grey, cream, light blue)
- Alternative: Plain t-shirt worn casually (cotton only; ribbed crew neck characteristic of era)
- Pants: cotton/wool trousers in grey, olive, tan (NO jeans unless scene-appropriate casual domestic setting)
- Footwear: if visible, simple shoes (no athletic sneakers; loafers, basic leather shoes period-appropriate)

**AUTOMOTIVE/STREET MODE:**

**Adult Feminine:**
- Primary: Cotton casual dress or blouse + cotton pants/jeans (period-appropriate casual street wear)
- Colors: muted, solid preferred; period prints acceptable
- Footwear: simple shoes, minimal heels, or casual leather; visible in street mode

**Adult Masculine:**
- Primary: Cotton/wool button-up shirt or simple t-shirt; casual but not athletic
- Pants: cotton trousers or period-appropriate jeans (straight-leg, NO contemporary tapers or distressing)
- Footwear: simple leather shoes, loafers, or basic casual shoes; visible in street framing

**PORTRAITURE MODE:**

**Adult Feminine:**
- Primary: Casual domestic attire (blouse + pants) or simple dress
- Makeup: minimal or absent (NOT contemporary full makeup; 1970s aesthetic: natural or subtle)
- Hair: natural presentation; period-appropriate styling (long straight, gentle waves, natural texture); NO modern blow-dry or contemporary cut

**Adult Masculine:**
- Primary: Simple shirt (button-up or t-shirt) presenting as authentic domestic subject
- Facial hair: if present, authentic to subject's natural facial hair (NO styling or grooming beyond authentic maintenance)
- Hair: natural, unstyled appearance; period cut if visible

### Fabric Behavior
- **Cotton:** Drapes naturally; visible creases authentic (NOT heavily pressed); wrinkles acceptable
- **Wool:** Structured appearance; slight sheen characteristic; texture visible
- **Linen:** Wrinkles natural and authentic; slight crease lines add period authenticity
- NO synthetic fabrics: polyester produces unnatural sheen and movement; spandex produces contemporary stretch; nylon produces modern finish

### Temporal Color Palette Restrictions
- **Pre-1970:** No synthetic aniline dyes (bright magenta, electric purple prohibited)
- **1970s palette:** Earth tones (ochre, rust, olive, tan, cream), natural dyes limited saturation
- **Flesh tone:** Human skin rendered authentically per dye-transfer film stock (warm but not pink, NOT modern digital skin tone)

### Temporal Prop Validation
ALL props must predate 1980 or remain period-agnostic (wood, fabric, simple metal). NO modern objects visible (no smartphones, no contemporary packaging, no modern appliances). Remove anachronistic objects from source images entirely; replace with period-appropriate alternatives where necessary (old appliance, simple furniture, natural objects).

### Setting Authenticity
- **Domestic Interiors:** 1970s American home (Memphis/Mississippi context); wood paneling acceptable; fluorescent ceiling fixtures period-authentic; simple furnishings; minimal decoration (NOT contemporary minimalism)
- **Automotive/Street:** American South street scene (Memphis/Mississippi); parked vehicles characteristic of 1970s-early 1980s; commercial signage; asphalt streets; minimal modern infrastructure (NO WiFi signs, NO digital displays)
- **Portraiture:** Domestic interior setting; authentic 1970s home interior; natural window light; simple background wall

### Hair Preservation & Period Styling

**CRITICAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Hair length MUST be preserved:** Short remains short; medium remains medium; long remains long
- **Hair color MUST be preserved:** Natural color maintained exactly
- **Baldness/balding MUST be preserved:** Bald subjects remain bald (period-appropriate presentation acceptable)
- **Facial hair presence MUST be preserved:** Clean-shaven subjects stay clean-shaven; bearded subjects retain beards

**PERIOD STYLING ADAPTATION (Preserving Length/Color/Presence):**

**Domestic Interiors Mode - Hair Styling:**
- **Short hair (male):** 1970s men's cuts (straight across, moderate sideburn length ~1.5 inches below ear); natural texture
- **Short hair (female):** 1970s women's short styles (shag, feathered, or neat bob); natural texture
- **Medium hair (any):** 1970s loose waves, natural curl, or straight presentation; center-parted or side-parted acceptable
- **Long hair (female):** 1970s long styles (straight, gentle waves, center-parted); natural texture emphasized
- **Baldness:** Natural bald head; NO excessive shine, NO modern smooth aesthetic; authentic scalp texture

**Automotive/Street Mode - Hair Styling:**
- **Short (male):** Practical 1970s cut (straight, minimal styling); authentic to period
- **Medium/Long (any):** Wind-blown or naturally tousled appearance acceptable (outdoor documentary aesthetic); minimal grooming implied
- **Baldness:** Natural bald head; authentic to street photography context

**Portraiture Mode - Hair Styling:**
- **Short (male):** Simple period-appropriate cut (not heavily styled; natural appearance)
- **Short (female):** Period-appropriate women's cut (not heavily blow-dried; natural texture)
- **Medium/Long (any):** Naturally presented; minimal styling evident (not blow-dried contemporary style; natural waves/texture)
- **Baldness:** Natural bald presentation; authentic to subject

**Facial Hair Mandate:**
- If subject clean-shaven: maintain clean-shaven (period-appropriate grooming)
- If subject has facial hair: render period-appropriate facial hair (1970s beard/mustache styles allowed; NO contemporary sculpted beards or fade-lines)
- DO NOT add facial hair where none exists
- DO NOT remove facial hair that exists

### Critical Vocabulary Clarifications for NanoBanana

**Use these terms ONLY with parenthetical specification:**
- "soft focus" → PROHIBITED unless (EXPLICIT NEGATIVE: "NO soft focus; crisp photographic edges required")
- "warm light" → PERMITTED only with (color temperature specification: "tungsten 2,800-3,200K" or "solar 5,500K+")
- "saturated colors" → PERMITTED only with (quantified range: "moderate saturation 30-45%, not hyper-saturated digital boost")
- "grain" → PERMITTED only with (specification: "fine-to-moderate dye-transfer grain, NOT absent, NOT heavy plugin grain")
- "dramatic" → PROHIBITED unless (related to solar contrast: "dramatic shadows from harsh sun, NOT artificial studio drama")
- "artistic" → PROHIBITED; use (specific aesthetic descriptor: "documentary deadpan", "democratic equality", "color revolution")
- "beautiful" → PROHIBITED; use (technical descriptor: "chromatic precision", "luminous blacks", "tonal separation")

### Vocabulary Warnings
- AVOID: "ornate", "elaborate", "decorative" (triggers frame/border generation; Eggleston works frameless)
- AVOID: "harmonious", "pleasant", "lovely" (triggers sentimentalized aesthetic contradicting deadpan documentary)
- AVOID: "perfect", "flawless", "idealized" (triggers retouching/beautification contradicting documentary authenticity)

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

### Ratio-Specific Composition Requirements

**DOMESTIC INTERIORS (3:4 portrait ratio - vertical emphasis):**
- Vertical format emphasizes room height, ceiling fixtures, wall surfaces
- Subject positioned 35-50% of frame (human subjects, furniture pieces, domestic objects)
- Background occupies 50-65% (walls, floor, ceiling, architectural elements)
- Depth cues: foreground (nearest furniture/subject) → mid-ground (wall/floor intersection) → background (far wall/corner)
- Democratic equality: subject receives NO compositional emphasis beyond proportional placement; background elements visually equal
- Horizon line: if visible, placed 1/3 from bottom (floor level) or omitted entirely (interior mode typical)

**AUTOMOTIVE/STREET (4:3 landscape or 16:9 widescreen - horizontal emphasis):**
- Landscape format emphasizes environmental breadth, street depth, sky expanse
- Subject vehicle positioned 25-40% of frame (off-center preferred; compositional asymmetry standard)
- Background occupies 60-75% (street, sky, architecture, signage)
- Depth cues: foreground (near pavement) → mid-ground (subject vehicle, street furniture) → background (distant buildings, sky)
- Democratic equality: vehicle treated as equivalent element to surrounding environment (NOT heroic subject framing)
- Horizon line: typically 1/3 from top (sky emphasis) or 1/3 from bottom (street emphasis); rarely centered

**PORTRAITURE (3:4 portrait ratio - vertical emphasis):**
- Vertical format suitable for head-and-shoulders composition
- Subject positioned 40-60% of frame (equal visual weight to background)
- Background occupies 40-60% (domestic interior wall, furniture, doorway, window, architectural elements)
- Depth cues: foreground (subject face/shoulders) → mid-ground (body/chair) → background (wall/wall texture/shadow)
- Democratic equality: subject head given no more visual emphasis than background furniture/walls; documentary object treatment
- Framing: typically loose (not tight crop); allows environmental context integration

### Style-Specific Composition (Mode-Differentiated)

**DOMESTIC INTERIORS MODE - Composition:**

**Perspective Regime:** Orthographic front-facing preferred (camera square to walls); slight 45-degree angle acceptable for environmental context inclusion

**Grid/Symmetry:** Architectural planes (wall, floor, ceiling, doorframe) create implicit compositional grid; formal geometric structure underlying deadpan documentary aesthetic

**Figure:Ground Ratio:** 35:65 to 50:50 (subject never exceeds 50% importance)

**Density (%):** 70-85% of frame occupied by interior detail (furniture, fixtures, decorative objects); minimal negative space

**Lighting Logic:** Ambient tungsten (2,800-3,200K ceiling fixtures primary) + fluorescent secondary (green contamination) + window daylight tertiary (cool blue accent)

**Detail:Negative Space Ratio:** High detail, minimal negative space; every surface holds visual information

**AUTOMOTIVE/STREET MODE - Composition:**

**Perspective Regime:** Linear receding (street vanishing point) or orthographic front-facing (subject vehicle perpendicular to camera)

**Grid/Symmetry:** Architectural background (building facades, storefront windows) or street grid (lane markings, curb lines) provide underlying structure

**Figure:Ground Ratio:** 25:75 to 40:60 (vehicle is ancillary element within larger environmental context)

**Density (%):** 60-75% of frame occupied by street/architecture/sky detail; negative space present but purposeful

**Lighting Logic:** Harsh direct solar (5,500-6,500K) creating dramatic shadow contrasts; NO artificial fill

**Detail:Negative Space Ratio:** Moderate-to-high detail; strategic negative space (sky expanse, open street) balances visual information

**PORTRAITURE MODE - Composition:**

**Perspective Regime:** Frontal or near-frontal (3/4 profile acceptable); centered or slightly off-center

**Grid/Symmetry:** Informal; background wall/furniture create implied but not rigid structure

**Figure:Ground Ratio:** 40:60 to 60:40 (subject head-and-shoulders given weight equivalent to background)

**Density (%):** 50-65% of frame occupied by detail (subject features, background wall, furniture edges)

**Lighting Logic:** Ambient interior (tungsten/window/fluorescent mix) captured as-is; NO artificial modification

**Detail:Negative Space Ratio:** Moderate detail; background wall/space provides visual rest; NOT cluttered

### Universal Composition Requirements

**Surface Context Anchor:** [drywall-domestic, asphalt-street, wall-portrait] appropriate to mode with authentic material characteristics

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT entirely (Eggleston works presented without borders or frames; dead-edge print standard)

**Production Context Anchor:** Dye-transfer printing process signature; archival baryta paper substrate; characteristic luminous blacks and saturated midtones; NOT contemporary digital print aesthetic

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for FINAL adapted ratio (per Section 2); recomposed entirely from source if necessary; NO letterboxing

**Democratic Equality Anchor:** All frame elements (subject, furniture, pavement, sky, architecture) receive visually equivalent compositional weight; NO hierarchical emphasis

**Mode-Specific Composition Anchor:**
- **Domestic Interiors:** Centered furniture positioning; vertical format; ambient tungsten dominant; background density 50-65%
- **Automotive/Street:** Off-center vehicle positioning; landscape format; solar harshness dominant; background density 60-75%
- **Portraiture:** Frontal or 3/4 subject positioning; vertical format; ambient interior lighting; background density 40-60%

### Lighting Specifications by Mode

**DOMESTIC INTERIORS LIGHTING:**
- **Key Light:** Tungsten ceiling fixture (2,800-3,200K) producing warm cast on ceiling, upper walls, furniture surfaces
- **Fill Light:** Ambient room reflection (no artificial fill); shadows retain depth
- **Secondary Light:** Fluorescent fixture (if present) introducing green color contamination (H=90-110°)
- **Tertiary Light:** Window daylight (5,500K+) entering as accent, creating cool blue shadows
- **Ratio:** 2:1 to 3:1 key:fill (moderate contrast; interior mode lower contrast than exterior)
- **Shadow Floor:** L=67 minimum (shadows remain readable, NOT crushed black)
- **Quality:** Mix of hard (direct tungsten) and soft (ambient room reflection)

**AUTOMOTIVE/STREET LIGHTING:**
- **Key Light:** Direct solar (5,500-6,500K) creating harsh, high-contrast shadows
- **Fill Light:** None (no artificial fill; ambient sky diffusion only)
- **Secondary Light:** Sky (cool blue 200-240° H) providing subtle shadow illumination
- **Tertiary Light:** Reflected light from asphalt/concrete (neutral grey, minimal chromatic influence)
- **Ratio:** 3:1 to 5:1 key:fill (dramatic solar contrast)
- **Shadow Floor:** L=31 minimum (deep shadows acceptable; NOT crushed but substantially darker)
- **Quality:** Hard direct sun creating sharp shadow edges; NO diffusion

**PORTRAITURE LIGHTING:**
- **Key Light:** Ambient interior (tungsten or window daylight depending on time of day)
- **Fill Light:** Ambient room reflection (no artificial modification)
- **Secondary Light:** Possible secondary window creating dimensional modeling
- **Ratio:** 2:1 to 2.5:1 key:fill (moderate; portraiture typically lower contrast)
- **Shadow Floor:** L=40-50 range (shadows readable; skin tone in shadow zone visible)
- **Quality:** Mix of warm (tungsten if afternoon) and cool (window if present) creating dimensional face modeling

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**TEXT POLICY: OMIT ENTIRELY**

Eggleston's photographic work does NOT incorporate overlaid text, artist signatures, captions, or typography within frame. Final image must be clean, text-free composition. NO visible watermarks, NO artist signatures, NO credit text, NO captions embedded in image.

If historical context requires titling, handle in gallery/museum presentation metadata, NOT within photographic frame.
