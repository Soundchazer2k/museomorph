about: >
  Guy Bourdin (1928–1991) revolutionized fashion photography by infusing
  surrealist narrative and psychological tension into commercial imagery.
  Mentored by Man Ray, Bourdin's work transcends product display, employing
  mannequins, fragmented figures, dramatic theatrical lighting, and hyperreal
  color saturation to explore themes of alienation, voyeurism, and desire.
  His meticulous medium-format approach—using Hasselblad 500C, Kodachrome/
  Ektachrome film, and precise studio strobes—created instantly recognizable
  aesthetic that challenged commercial photography conventions while maintaining
  technical mastery. His work for Vogue Paris (1955+) and Charles Jourdan
  campaigns established the template for conceptual fashion advertising.

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**CRITICAL MANDATES:**

- **Canvas Override:** Recompose to exactly the declared aspect ratio—ignore source image dimensions completely.
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement:** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of [X:Y] specified below. Enforce through explicit declaration in multiple prompt locations and negative constraints against renderer defaults.
- **Identity via Silhouette/Gesture/Expression:** Likeness established through pose, body language, and psychological distance rather than facial recognition. Anonymous figures are AUTHORIZED.
- **Gender Expression Mandate:** Preserve subject's presented gender identity through period-appropriate styling (1950-1990). Maintain cross-mode consistency.
- **IP Safeguard:** Original designs avoiding copyrighted fashion logos, brand signatures, or commercial trademarks. Bourdin-adjacent aesthetic without trademark infringement.
- **Style Dominance:** Surrealist narrative, psychological atmosphere, and technical precision OVERRIDE literal fashion display.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications (hex values, lighting ratios, shadow floor L%, contrast ratios, color saturation %) override descriptive language.
- **Material Authenticity:** Kodachrome film stock color science, C-print glossy finish, studio strobe lighting precision—NOT digital perfection or modern photo filters.
- **Process Over Result:** How materials are applied (studio strobe angle, film stock saturation, darkroom printing decisions) supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Hair Preservation:** Maintain subject's hair length, color, baldness, and facial hair presence. Apply period-appropriate styling (1950-1990) while preserving these characteristics.
- **Anatomical Elegance:** Proportional refinement serves aesthetic refinement, NOT excessive distortion. Mannequin-like quality when intentional, human authenticity when required.
- **Mode Isolation:** Each mode (SATURATED_EDITORIAL, DARK_SURREALIST, MINIMALIST_GRAPHIC) activates distinct technique ecosystem. NO cross-mode contamination.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**NanoBanana Supported Ratios (Native - No Adaptation Required):**

All selected ratios are NanoBanana native supported:

- ✅ `4:3` (landscape, standard 1184×864 @ NanoBanana, reflects Hasselblad 500C/M format)
- ✅ `3:2` (landscape, cinematic 1248×832, classic editorial)
- ✅ `16:9` (widescreen, panoramic 1344×768, narrative scope)
- ✅ `3:4` (portrait, 864×1184, fashion magazine vertical)
- ✅ `4:5` (portrait, 896×1152, editorial tall format)

**Ratio Selection Strategy:**

- **For SATURATED_EDITORIAL_FASHION mode:** Prefer `4:3` or `3:2` (figure-dominant composition with environmental context, classic editorial proportions)
- **For DARK_SURREALIST_CONCEPTUAL mode:** Prefer `3:2` or `4:3` (cinematic narrative space, theatrical framing)
- **For MINIMALIST_GRAPHIC_EDITORIAL mode:** Prefer `3:4` or `4:5` (portrait focus, graphic design verticality, clean composition)

**Canvas Recomposition Strategy:**

Recompose entire image for declared ratio. DO NOT adapt source dimensions or preserve source framing.

**Spatial Allocation (Mode-Specific):**

- **SATURATED_EDITORIAL_FASHION:** Figure placement 50-70% frame area. Secondary environmental context 30-50% frame. Composition balanced between portrait and narrative.
- **DARK_SURREALIST_CONCEPTUAL:** Figure or conceptual element 40-70% frame. Minimal environmental fill. Emphasis on negative space and psychological distance.
- **MINIMALIST_GRAPHIC_EDITORIAL:** Figure or product 20-80% (variable, design-dependent). Graphic element placement. Clean compositional hierarchy.

**Background Treatment (Ratio-Specific Recomposition):**

- **For landscape ratios (4:3, 3:2, 16:9):** Extend background horizontally to fill declared width. Maintain architectural lines, environmental context, or studio depth. NO artificial letterboxing or padding.
- **For portrait ratios (3:4, 4:5):** Extend background vertically to fill declared height. Maintain atmospheric depth or studio context. Clean vertical composition.

**Format Justification:**

Ratios selected to honor Bourdin's working aesthetic (Hasselblad native proportions while accommodating editorial publication standards from 1950s-1990s). 4:3 and 3:2 reflect original medium format; 3:4 and 4:5 accommodate magazine publication; 16:9 enables cinematic narrative scope. All ratios support thematic and technical requirements without forcing unnatural adaptation.

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:**

- **Man Ray** (primary mentor): Surrealist principles, unconventional approach, fascination with form and light
- **René Magritte:** Unsettling juxtaposition, subversion of reality, symbolic ambiguity
- **Salvador Dalí:** Dreamlike landscapes, psychological intensity, temporal distortion
- **Alfred Hitchcock & Film Noir:** Suspense, voyeurism, psychological thrillers, cinematic composition
- **Balthus & Edward Hopper:** Enigmatic figures, urban alienation, psychological landscapes
- **Hans Bellmer:** Fragmented/mannequin figures, body exploration, surrealist objectification

**Medium & Production Method:**

**Primary Camera:** Hasselblad 500C/M medium format (6×6cm negatives, square format)
**Film Stock:** Kodachrome 25/64 and Ektachrome (color transparency film, vivid saturation, fine grain, high color fidelity)
**Lighting Equipment:** Studio strobe lights (Balcar, Profoto, or equivalent high-power flash), softboxes, snoots, reflectors, umbrellas
**Print Medium:** C-prints on glossy photographic paper (chromogenic color prints, vibrant color reproduction, gloss finish)
**Darkroom Precision:** Meticulous printing control, color balance, exposure refinement, selective cropping for maximum psychological impact

**Technical Process:** Meticulous pre-visualization → Location/set scouting → Precise lighting setup → Multiple exposures with subtle variations → Darkroom selection and printing → Final cropping and presentation

**Production Era Authenticity (1950-1990):**

Studio strobe technology evolved during Bourdin's career; use era-appropriate equipment characteristics. Kodachrome color science maintained consistency (warm, saturated, fine grain). C-print technology provided color fidelity superior to other era-appropriate methods. NO digital photo filters, NO modern post-processing simulation, NO Instagram effects. Surface must exhibit authentic C-print characteristics: glossy sheen, sharp detail, color separation without digital smoothing.

**Thematic Purpose:**

Fashion photography transcended into conceptual art. Narrative ambiguity explores themes of desire, alienation, death, voyeurism, and the uncanny. Commercial product (fashion, shoes, beauty) integrated into psychological scenarios. Subject positioned as form/object rather than personality. Psychological tension and intellectual engagement prioritized over aspirational beauty.

**5 Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Headless/Anonymous Figures** (mannequins, cropped heads, obscured faces): Objectification, depersonalization, identity erasure as conceptual tool
2. **Hyperreal Color Saturation** (S: 85-98%): Kodachrome film stock characteristic, intentional artificial quality heightening psychological discomfort
3. **High-Contrast Studio Lighting** (Contrast ratios 2.5-6:1): Dramatic shadow modeling, theatrical quality, psychological tension
4. **Unconventional Composition** (Off-center cropping, eccentric framing, edge-cropping): Voyeuristic angles, psychological distance, compositional precision as artistic statement
5. **Narrative Ambiguity** (Open-ended psychological scenarios, impossible juxtapositions, psychological undertones): Surrealist influence, conceptual depth, intellectual engagement required

**Tone Tag:** `psychological-tension | surrealist-commercial | theatrical-voyeuristic | intellectual-discomfort | hyperreal-artificial`

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

### SATURATED_EDITORIAL_FASHION Mode

#### Context

Vogue editorial sensibility infused with psychological complexity. Fashion as narrative vehicle, not aspirational ideal. Figure-dominant composition with hyperreal color saturation characteristic of Kodachrome film stock and precise studio strobe lighting. Theatrical yet commercially viable. Psychological undercurrent beneath fashion focus.

#### Measurements

- **Color Saturation Range:** S: 85-98% (hyperreal, NOT natural S: 40-50%)
- **Saturation Validation:** Dominant colors measured against corpus: Primary Red #c22119 (S: 95%), Teal #5baddf (S: 88%), Gold #e9ae21 (S: 98%)
- **Lighting Ratio:** Highlight L% ÷ Shadow L% = 2.5-3:1 (theatrical but readable)
- **Shadow Floor (Luminance Minimum):** L ≥ 30% (shadow detail readable, NOT crushed)
- **Highlight Ceiling (Luminance Maximum):** L ≤ 95% (texture preserved, NOT blown white)
- **Overall Scene Luminance:** L ≥ 45% (readable documentation aesthetic)
- **Key Light Intensity:** 1500±300 nits (bright, controlled studio strobe)
- **Key Light Direction:** Upper-front orientation (approximately 10-14 o'clock from camera axis)
- **Color Palette Master:** Red #c22119 (primary), Teal #5baddf (secondary), Gold #e9ae21 (accent)
- **Kodachrome Signature:** Warm color cast in shadows, jewel-tone clarity, fine grain preservation
- **Tonal Zones per Form:** 5-6 distinct luminance steps within major forms (face, clothing, background)
- **Figure Coverage:** 50-75% of frame area occupied by primary subject
- **Cropping Style:** Conventional framing with intentional composition (NOT edge-cropped, NOT overly tight)
- **Background Detail:** 40-50% frame area context/environmental narrative (moderate density)
- **Depth Layering:** 2-3 distinct spatial planes (foreground figure, mid-tone background)
- **Edge Quality:** Sharp photographic focus throughout, NO soft painting simulation
- **Surface Finish:** Glossy C-print appearance (photographic sheen, professional reproduction)
- **Anatomical Anonymity:** 40% of figures in this mode are anonymous/headless (lower than surrealist mode, fashion-forward)
- **Face Visibility:** 60% of figures show face or upper body identification
- **Pose Formality:** Static, formal positioning with minimal gesture economy
- **Gesture Type:** Controlled, theatrical posing (NOT candid movement)

#### Technique

- **Studio Strobe Setup:** Hard directional key light from upper-front (1-2 o'clock), positioned 8-12 feet from subject at 45° angle. Power: 1500±300 nits (bright, controlled modulation). Modifier: Hard reflector or small softbox for directional quality with slight softening.
- **Fill Light Integration:** Minimal fill (ratio 2.5-3:1) creates shadow depth while maintaining readability. Possible: reflector boards (silver or white) positioned opposite key light for subtle fill.
- **Color Correction (Kodachrome Simulation):** Warm color cast maintained in shadow areas (H shift +5-10° toward warm). Shadow saturation preserved (NOT desaturated toward gray). Highlight saturation maintained.
- **Color Saturation Enforcement:** Primary colors rendered at S: 85-98% (HYPERREAL, NOT natural). Reds measured against corpus value #c22119. Teals measured against #5baddf. Golds measured against #e9ae21. NO natural saturation reduction.
- **Tonal Separation Method:** Lighting geometry creates 5-6 distinct zones: 1) Brightest highlight (L: 88-95%), 2-4) Mid-tones stepped at ~15% intervals, 5) Shadow detail (L: 30-40%), 6) Darkest shadow (L: 30-35% floor, NOT below).
- **Focal Length Simulation:** Medium format Hasselblad perspective (roughly equivalent to 50-80mm on 35mm). Slight compression, minimal distortion. NO extreme wide-angle distortion.
- **Focus Treatment:** Tack-sharp throughout entire composition (medium format precision). NO selective focus, NO artistic blur. All elements crystal-clear.
- **Cropping Decision:** Conventional framing honoring subject composition. Margins balanced. NOT extreme edge-cropping (reserve for surrealist mode).
- **Darkroom Printing Control:** Balanced color reproduction. Highlights preserved (L ceiling 95%). Shadows readable (L floor 30%). Print contrast 2.5-3:1 maintained. NO crushing shadows, NO blown highlights.
- **Grain Structure:** Fine grain (Kodachrome characteristic), invisible at viewing distance. NO artificial grain introduction, NO visible film grain simulation.
- **Surface Character:** Glossy photographic paper finish. Slight specular reflection suggesting C-print reproduction. NO matte appearance, NO watercolor texture.
- **Mannequin Protocol:** If mannequin deployed (objectification/fashion narrative), render anatomically precise. Smooth skin, perfect proportions, synthetic material evident but not grotesque.
- **Fabric Rendering:** Clothing materials rendered with authentic sheen and drape. Silk reflectivity at ~30-40% specular. Cotton matte at ~10-15%. Leather high gloss at ~50-70%. Material-specific behavior evident.
- **Hair Treatment:** Preserve subject's hair length and color. Apply 1950-1990 styling appropriate to era and commercial context. If long hair: waves/curls typical of era. If short hair: controlled, professional styling. If bald/balding: present authentically or with era-appropriate head covering.

### DARK_SURREALIST_CONCEPTUAL Mode

#### Context

Maximum psychological tension. Black-dominant color schemes with high-saturation accents. Mannequins, headless figures, disembodied limbs emphasized. Studio-constructed narratives exploring themes of voyeurism, objectification, death, and the uncanny. Man Ray influence paramount. Lighting dramatized to theatrical extremes. Narrative ambiguity intentional and pronounced.

#### Measurements

- **Color Saturation Range:** S: 75-95% (hyperreal, accent colors highly saturated)
- **Primary Dark Ground:** #010303 (H: 0°, S: 0%, L: 5-10%)
- **Accent Color Saturation:** S: 75-95% (placed on dark ground for maximum contrast)
- **Secondary Accent:** Pinkish/flesh #dcced1 (H: 10°, S: 8%, L: 80%, warm tone against black)
- **Lighting Ratio:** Highlight L% ÷ Shadow L% = 5-6:1 (EXTREME contrast, theatrical drama)
- **Shadow Floor (Luminance Minimum):** L ≥ 15% (near-black but maintains technical minimum for detail)
- **Highlight Ceiling (Luminance Maximum):** L ≤ 95% (texture preserved in brightest areas)
- **Overall Scene Luminance:** L ≥ 35% (darker documentary, psychological intensity)
- **Key Light Intensity:** 1800±400 nits (bright strobe pushing extreme shadows)
- **Key Light Direction:** Upper-front to side-front (8-16 o'clock orientation), dramatic angle
- **Tonal Zones per Form:** 5-6 distinct luminance steps but with EXTREME separation (deep shadows immediately adjacent to bright highlights)
- **Figure Coverage:** 40-70% of frame area
- **Background Detail:** 30-50% frame area (minimal context, focus on abstract/conceptual)
- **Depth Layering:** 1-2 planes (shallow spatial organization, emphasis on graphic/surreal)
- **Cropping Style:** Unconventional, tight cropping permitted. Edge-cropping of heads, limbs acceptable (surrealist fragmentation).
- **Edge Quality:** Sharp photographic focus with INTENTIONAL hard edges (emphasis on graphic quality over painterly smoothness)
- **Surface Finish:** Glossy C-print appearance maintained (professional photographic standard)
- **Anatomical Anonymity:** 80% of figures are anonymous/headless/mannequin/disembodied
- **Face Visibility:** 20% maximum faces visible (majority anonymous)
- **Mannequin Usage:** 60-80% of mode images feature mannequins or mannequin-like figures
- **Pose Formality:** Mannequin-like stillness, uncomfortable positioning, psychological distance emphasized
- **Gesture Type:** Minimal gesture, static/frozen quality, detached/unnatural body language
- **Fragmented Elements:** Disembodied limbs (legs, hands, torsos) frequently isolated

#### Technique

- **Studio Strobe Setup:** Hard directional key light from extreme upper-front or side-front (8 o'clock or 4 o'clock orientation), positioned 6-10 feet from subject at 60-75° angle. Power: 1800±400 nits (BRIGHT, extreme modeling). Modifier: Hard reflector creating SHARP shadow edges.
- **Fill Light Integration:** MINIMAL or ABSENT fill. Ratio 5-6:1 creates deep shadow areas with technical floor only (L floor 15%). Possible: INTENTIONAL NO fill (hard key light only) creating graphic shadow areas.
- **Shadow Crushing Authorization:** Shadow floor L: 15-20% permits near-black areas. This is INTENTIONAL STYLE CHOICE supporting psychological drama, NOT technical failure. Ensure L never drops below 15% (technical minimum for image data).
- **Color Correction (Black Ground):** #010303 rendered as pure/near-pure black. NO blue-black or warm-black shift. RGB values near-identical (010303 maintains chromatic neutrality). Accent colors placed against this black ground for maximum pop.
- **Accent Color Saturation:** Primary accents rendered at S: 75-95% (high but slightly less saturated than Editorial mode due to dark ground intensity). Colors appear MORE saturated against black due to contrast psychology.
- **Tonal Separation Method:** EXTREME separation using 5-6 distinct zones with LARGE luminance gaps. Example: Highlight L: 90%, Mid-tone L: 65%, Shadow L: 40%, Near-black L: 20%, Black floor L: 15%. Zones NOT smoothly graduated; STEPPED appearance acceptable.
- **Focal Length Simulation:** Medium format Hasselblad perspective (50-80mm equivalent). Possible inclusion of wider angles (35mm equivalent) for surreal distortion if conceptually justified.
- **Focus Treatment:** Tack-sharp throughout (medium format precision). All elements crystal-clear, NO atmospheric blur (sharpness emphasizes graphic/surreal quality).
- **Cropping Decision:** UNCONVENTIONAL CROPPING ENCOURAGED. Edge-cropping of heads, limbs acceptable. Tight framing. Voyeuristic angles. Compositional precision used for psychological effect.
- **Darkroom Printing Control:** EXTREME contrast maintained. Highlights crisp and bright (L: 90-95%). Shadows DEEP (L: 15-20%, near-black). NO gradual tonality; STEPPED separation preferred. NO crushing detail below L: 15%.
- **Grain Structure:** Fine grain maintained (Kodachrome characteristic). Invisible at viewing distance. NO exaggerated grain, but NO grain reduction either. Authentic film stock appearance.
- **Surface Character:** Glossy C-print finish maintained. Slight specular reflection. Hard edges emphasize graphic quality. NO soft/diffuse appearance.
- **Mannequin Protocol:** Render mannequin-like figures with INTENTIONAL synthetic quality. Smooth skin (L: 78-85%, S: 10-20% flesh saturation, slightly desaturated from natural). Perfect proportions. Material plasticity evident but not grotesque. Objectification is thematic MANDATE.
- **Disembodied Limbs:** Isolated legs, hands, torsos rendered anatomically perfect with sharp photographic detail. Placement within frame intentionally disorienting (spatial logic disrupted). Surrealist juxtaposition emphasized.
- **Fabric Rendering:** Clothing may appear uncomfortable/contorted (psychological discomfort). Material sheen rendered authentically but overall impression is uncanny/disturbing. Tight/binding appearance possible.
- **Hair Treatment:** Preserve subject's hair length and color. Apply 1950-1990 styling. If mannequin: synthetic/artificial hair texture acceptable. If human figure: period-appropriate styling maintained.

#### Validation

- **Black Ground Verification:** Primary black #010303 rendered at L: 5-10% (target ±3%)
- **Accent Color at Saturation Target:** Primary accent S: 75-95% (measured against corpus values)
- **Shadow Floor at Psychological Floor:** Darkest areas L: 15-20% (confirms near-black without technical crushing below L: 15%)
- **Lighting Ratio Check:** Highlight L÷Shadow L = 5-6.0 (target ±0.5)
- **Figure Coverage:** Subject occupies 40-70% of frame area
- **Tonal Step Count:** Major form shows 5-6 distinct zones with STEPPED (NOT smooth) separation
- **Anonymous Figures:** 80%+ of human figures lacking visible faces or heads
- **Mannequin Presence:** 60-80% of mode images feature mannequins
- **Cropping Unconventionality:** Edge-cropping or extreme framing present (NOT conventional composition)
- **Background Sparseness:** Environmental context minimal (30-50% frame area)

- **Remove any modern objects** from source images entirely
- **Mode-appropriate context:** Portrait props differ from surrealist props differ from minimalist props

- Artificially constructed
- Narrative ambiguity in environment

### MINIMALIST_GRAPHIC_EDITORIAL Mode - Setting

**Interior Settings (Primary):**

**Coherence Filter:**

- **All elements support declared mode** with documented historical accuracy
- **Fallback:** Clean studio backgrounds with minimal contextual elements (safely period-appropriate)
- **When uncertain about temporal accuracy:** OMIT rather than risk anachronism
- **Cross-check furnishings, architectural elements, vehicles (if visible)** against 1950-1991 availability

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**Ratio-Specific Composition Requirements (For Final Applied Ratio):**

### Portrait Ratios (3:4, 4:5):

**Vertical Emphasis:** Figure dominance ≥60%, vertical compositional thrust, hierarchical staging with format-specific considerations.

**Compositional Hierarchy:**
- Primary figure: Upper 2/3 to central positioning
- Secondary context: Lower 1/3 or flanking sides
- Head placement: Upper-middle frame area
- Negative space: Below or around figure

**Spatial Allocation:**
- Figure height: 60-80% of frame
- Width coverage: 40-70% of frame width
- Background/context: 20-40% frame area
- Depth layers: 1-2 main planes (portrait-focused)

**Format-Specific Considerations:**
- Vertical aspect ratio enables full-body or close-up portraiture
- Elongated space permits compositional breathing room
- Psychological isolation emphasized (tall, narrow frame)

### Landscape Ratios (4:3, 3:2, 16:9):

**Horizontal Flow:** Environmental context ≥40%, panoramic staging with cultural viewing traditions.

**Compositional Hierarchy:**
- Primary figure: Left or central positioning
- Secondary environment: Right side or background
- Horizon line (if applicable): Upper third or lower third
- Negative space: Flanking sides

**Spatial Allocation:**
- Figure width: 40-70% of frame width
- Height coverage: 50-70% of frame height
- Background/context: 30-60% frame area
- Depth layers: 2-3 main planes (figure + environment)

**Format-Specific Considerations:**
- Horizontal aspect ratio enables figure + narrative context
- Panoramic tradition supports cinematic composition
- Story potential (before/after implications)

### Square (1:1):

**Central Balance:** Radial composition, equal weight distribution, format-specific layout rules.

**Compositional Hierarchy:**
- Central positioning (figure or negative space centered)
- Balanced quadrants
- Symmetrical or near-symmetrical composition

**Spatial Allocation:**
- Figure centered: 50-70% of area
- Balanced negative space: 30-50%
- Depth layers: 1-2 main planes (symmetry priority)

---

**Mode-Specific Composition & Lighting:**

### SATURATED_EDITORIAL_FASHION Mode

**Illustrated/Painted Perception (though Photographic Medium):**

- **Perspective Regime:** Linear perspective with cultural accuracy. Architectural elements (if present) rendered with period-appropriate spatial logic (1950-1990 architecture).
- **Grid/Symmetry:** Rule-of-thirds composition common. Subject positioned on intersection lines (35-50% of canvas for primary subject, 25% each for secondary elements).
- **Figure:Ground:** 50-70% figure, 30-50% environment. Compositional intent determines ratio.
- **Density:** 40-50% background detail density (moderate contextual narrative).
- **Lighting Logic:** Studio strobe control evident. Highlight/shadow separation theatrical but readable (2.5-3:1 contrast).
- **Detail:Negative Space Ratio:** High detail in figure, moderate detail in background. Negative space provides compositional breath.

**Ratio-Optimized Composition (Apply to Final Ratio):**

- **If Portrait Ratio (3:4, 4:5):** Figure dominance 60-75%, vertical emphasis, head upper-middle positioning
- **If Landscape Ratio (4:3, 3:2, 16:9):** Figure dominance 50-70%, environmental narrative 30-50%, horizontal flow permitted
- **If Square (1:1):** Centered or balanced off-center, symmetrical possibility, equal quadrant consideration

### DARK_SURREALIST_CONCEPTUAL Mode

**Conceptual Composition:**

- **Perspective Regime:** Linear perspective disrupted when conceptually justified. Surrealist spatial illogic permitted (impossible angles, distorted scale).
- **Grid/Symmetry:** Off-center, eccentric, or asymmetrical positioning emphasized. Compositional disruption mirrors psychological disruption.
- **Figure:Ground:** 40-70% figure, 30-60% conceptual/abstract ground. Negative space as psychological element.
- **Density:** 30-50% background detail density (minimal context, focus on abstract concept).
- **Lighting Logic:** Extreme theatrical lighting (5-6:1 contrast). Surrealist drama paramount. Lighting serves psychological tension.
- **Detail:Negative Space Ratio:** Sharp focus on figure, minimal background detail. Negative space as void/psychological distance.

**Ratio-Optimized Composition:**

- **If Portrait Ratio:** Possible edge-cropping, eccentric positioning, psychological isolation via vertical elongation
- **If Landscape Ratio:** Panoramic psychological space, compositional eccentricity emphasized, environmental void
- **If Square:** Central void possible, off-center tension, symmetry disrupted

---

### MINIMALIST_GRAPHIC_EDITORIAL Mode

**Graphic Design Composition:**

- **Perspective Regime:** Orthographic flat composition common (NOT perspectival). Graphic hierarchy prioritized over spatial depth.
- **Grid/Symmetry:** Centered, balanced, or formal composition. Grid principle (quarters, thirds, halves).
- **Figure:Ground:** Variable 20-80% (design-dependent). Negative space as compositional element.
- **Density:** 10-30% background detail density (sparse, graphically clean).
- **Lighting Logic:** Flat or diffuse lighting. NO extreme drama. Clarity and form definition prioritized.
- **Detail:Negative Space Ratio:** Essential detail preserved, unnecessary detail omitted. Negative space maximized.

**Ratio-Optimized Composition:**

- **If Portrait Ratio:** Centered or vertically balanced, clean margins, portrait-gallery presentation
- **If Landscape Ratio:** Centered or horizontally balanced, clean margins, editorial clarity
- **If Square:** Centered, radial balance, graphic design principle (poster-like)

**UNIVERSAL COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS (All Modes):**

**Surface Context Anchor:** [wall|fresco plaster|silk scroll|canvas|screen|billboard|newsprint|magazine paper] appropriate to declared format with authentic material characteristics.
- SATURATED_EDITORIAL: Typically studio white, colored studio backdrop, or location interior wall
- DARK_SURREALIST: Studio backdrop (white or colored), abstract surface, void suggestion
- MINIMALIST_GRAPHIC: Studio white, colored graphic background, architectural surface

**Frame/Band Anchor (Policy):** **OMIT ENTIRELY** (not authentic to photography medium; reserved for illustrated media like illuminated manuscripts or Art Nouveau posters). Bourdin photographs present clean image boundaries without decorative frames.

**Production Context Anchor:** C-print chromogenic photographic paper, glossy finish, darkroom printing era-appropriate (1950-1990). NO digital printing artifacts, NO modern photo paper characteristics. Kodachrome/Ektachrome film stock characteristics evident in color fidelity and tonal separation.

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor (CRITICAL):** Composition designed specifically for declared ratio (final adapted ratio if Section 2.1 applied), NOT adapted from different format. Every compositional element serves declared aspect ratio. NO unnatural adaptation, NO letterboxing, NO stretched composition.

**Gender Expression Anchor:** Pose and gesture patterns appropriate to subject's gender using period-specific conventions (1950-1991). Cross-mode consistency required: male subjects maintain masculine presentation across SATURATED_EDITORIAL, DARK_SURREALIST, MINIMALIST_GRAPHIC modes. Female subjects maintain feminine presentation across all modes.

**Mode-Specific Composition Anchor:**

- **SATURATED_EDITORIAL:** Editorial clarity, fashion focus, figure-forward, commercial aesthetic, psychological undercurrent beneath surface beauty
- **DARK_SURREALIST:** Psychological narrative primacy, conceptual tension, surrealist juxtaposition, voyeuristic perspective, psychological distance emphasized
- **MINIMALIST_GRAPHIC:** Graphic design principle, form clarity, negative space integration, commercial editorial clarity, design-focused (not narrative-focused)

---

### MINIMALIST_GRAPHIC_EDITORIAL:
- **Key Light Direction:** Front or diffuse (minimal modeling), 0-30° angle
- **Key Light Quality:** Soft diffuse OR flat
- **Modeling Effect:** Minimal (graphic form emphasis)
- **Shadow Quality:** Soft or absent, L floor 50-75% (bright mode) or 10-15% (stark mode)
- **Highlight Preservation:** Maximum brightness, L ceiling 92-100%

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** OMIT entirely.

**Justification:** Fashion photography 1950-1991 primarily omitted text within image frames. Text placement (artist name, magazine masthead, product label) was handled as separate typographic element in magazine/advertisement layout, NOT integrated into photograph itself.

**Historical Accuracy:** Bourdin's photographs presented as pure visual imagery. Commercial context (Vogue magazine layout, Charles Jourdan advertising campaign) added text in design/layout layer OUTSIDE photograph boundary. Integrated text rare in Bourdin's oeuvre.

**Framework Directive:** Generate clean photographs WITHOUT embedded text, mastheads, signatures, or typographic overlays. Text integration anachronistic to Bourdin's photographic practice and medium-appropriate to era.
