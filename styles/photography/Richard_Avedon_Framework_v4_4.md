about: >
  Richard Avedon (1923–2004) revolutionized portrait and fashion photography through psychological intensity and technical mastery. 
  His white-background studio technique stripped away artifice to reveal raw human presence; his large-format 8x10 negatives captured unprecedented facial detail. 
  From fashion to "In the American West," Avedon democratized the monumental portrait, applying gallery-scale presentation to celebrities and marginalized Americans alike. 
  His work elevated commercial photography to fine art, emphasizing confrontational authenticity over idealized beauty.

# Richard Avedon — White-Background Psychological Portraiture Framework v4.4

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always recompose to exactly declared ratio; ignore source dimensions completely.
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement Protocol:** Aspect ratio control is prompt-based. All Avedon ratios (3:4, 4:5, 4:3, 16:9) are natively supported; no adaptation required. Enforce through:
  - Explicit ratio declaration in Sections 1, 2, 6
  - Compositional anchors designed for each ratio
  - Negative constraints prohibiting wrong ratios
- **Photographic Authenticity Mandate:** Film-grain signature, darkroom tonality, large-format sharpness override any digital smoothing.
- **Face Treatment Flags:** `film-grain-triX`, `studio-strobe-modeling`, `darkroom-timing-marks` (mode-specific).
- **Pose Flags:** `frontal-rigid` (studio), `candid-motion` (fashion), `psychological-tension` (West portrait).
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (all modes).
- **Material Physics Authority:** Silver gelatin printing, dodging/burning, Tri-X grain structure override aesthetic preferences.
- **Gender Expression Mandate:** Preserve subject's presented gender identity through period-appropriate styling (1950–1985 authenticity). Cross-mode consistency required.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantified specifications (ISO 400 Tri-X, 2:1–3:1 lighting ratio, 85–135mm equivalent focal length, face L=65–75%) override descriptive language.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** No digital filters, no Instagram effects, no modern post-processing. Darkroom-only revision (dodging/burning) permitted.
- **Composition Boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; no watermarks, signatures, or artificial presentation borders.
- **STRICT TERMINATION:** Framework ends at Section 8. NO checklist, commentary, or supplementary content beyond Section 8.

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[3:4 for studio/West, or 4:3/16:9 for fashion]** — ignore source image dimensions completely.
- **RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio as declared. This is a hard requirement. All Avedon ratios natively supported.
- **Mode Selector:** Choose one of three operational modes:
  - **"White Background Studio Portrait"** (celebrity/cultural figure psychological intensity)
  - **"Dynamic Fashion Editorial"** (movement, narrative staging, location context)
  - **"In-the-American-West Portrait"** (occupational/marginal subject, raw humanity, portable studio white backdrop)
- **Redraw in Richard Avedon's style** for **[chosen mode + exact format specification]**.
- **Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression:** Likeness established through face proportion, eye presence, gesture coherence, not photorealistic copying.
- **Gender Expression Mandate:** Preserve subject's presented gender identity through period-appropriate 1950–1985 styling. Male subjects remain masculine across all modes; female subjects remain feminine across all modes. Cross-mode consistency mandatory.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original subject design avoiding copyrighted elements. No real logos, watermarks, or identifiable signatures.
- **CRITICAL FLAGS (mandatory for all modes):**
  - Face-Treatment Flag: `film-grain-triX` (all modes); `studio-strobe-modeling` (studio/West); `hard-flash` (optional fashion)
  - Pose Flag: `frontal-rigid` (studio portrait); `candid-motion` (fashion editorial); `psychological-tension` (West portrait)
  - Canvas Control Flag: `strict-reframe` (all modes)
- **Style Dominance:** Avedon's signature is psychological directness through technical mastery — maximum facial detail, stark minimalism, raw human presence.
- **Final Ratio Confirmation:** Output must be exactly **[declared ratio]**, no exceptions.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**AVEDON NATIVE RATIOS (NanoBanana Supported):**

- ✅ **3:4** (portrait vertical) — Primary for Studio Portrait and West Portrait modes; emphasizes face dominance, monumental single-figure scale.
- ✅ **4:5** (portrait vertical) — Secondary for Studio Portrait; slight horizontal expansion for upper-body context.
- ✅ **4:3** (landscape horizontal) — Primary for Fashion Editorial; accommodates movement, narrative staging, environmental context.
- ✅ **16:9** (widescreen) — Secondary for Fashion Editorial; spreads across page/gallery wall; multiple figures/sequential action.

**Canvas Recomposition Strategy (Mode-Specific):**

**White Background Studio Portrait Mode (3:4 native):**
- Ratio Status: Native (no adaptation required)
- Reframing Method: `strict-reframe` — subject centered vertically; white background uniform 95–98% L; head positioned upper third (psychological dominance); shoulders/upper torso fill frame lower two-thirds
- Spatial Allocation: Subject frontal or slight 45° angle; face occupies 40–50% of vertical frame; negative white space creates visual breathing
- Background Treatment: Seamless white paper (curved backdrop effect); zero environmental context; infinite white recede
- Format Justification: 3:4 ratio emphasizes vertical psychological intensity; large-format exhibition tradition (monumental single portraits)

**Dynamic Fashion Editorial Mode (4:3 native):**
- Ratio Status: Native (no adaptation required)
- Reframing Method: `strict-reframe` — subject positioned left/center with narrative space (direction of movement/gesture); environmental or minimal backdrop context; horizontal flow emphasizes fabric/body dynamism
- Spatial Allocation: Figure 35–50% frame; background/environment 50–65%; compositional momentum left-to-right or dynamic diagonal
- Background Treatment: Location context (outdoor, café, circus, street); environmental narrative integration; varied tonality (not pure white)
- Format Justification: 4:3 ratio accommodates movement, fashion garment display, narrative staging; magazine editorial tradition (page integration)

**In-the-American-West Portrait Mode (3:4 native):**
- Ratio Status: Native (no adaptation required)
- Reframing Method: `strict-reframe` — subject centered vertically (identical to studio mode compositionally); portable studio white backdrop creates monumental single-figure presence; occupational context (worker identity priority over background)
- Spatial Allocation: Subject head-to-torso centered; white background dominates periphery; figure psychological isolation despite subject's occupational authenticity
- Background Treatment: Portable seamless white paper (outdoor/makeshift studio); minimal environmental bleed; white background creates gallery-scale presentation
- Format Justification: 3:4 ratio equalizes studio and American West portraits formally; democratic portraiture (marginalized subjects elevated to monumental scale)

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:**
- Alexey Brodovitch (mentor): Modern design dynamism, awakeness to spontaneity
- Martin Munkácsi: Movement liberation, outdoor fashion photography candor
- Ansel Adams: Darkroom tonality mastery, fine printing control
- European humanist photography: Psychological portraiture, cultural observation

**Medium/Production Method:**
- Primary Camera: 8x10 Deardorff or Sinar View Camera (studio/West portraits); Rolleiflex or Nikon (fashion editorial)
- Film Stock: Kodak Tri-X Pan (ISO 400) — primary B&W; fine organic grain (0.2–0.4mm visible at print scale); excellent tonal latitude; versatility across lighting conditions
- Printing Process: Silver gelatin fiber-based (Agfa Portriga Rapid, Oriental Seagull); archival quality; darkroom dodging/burning for tonal control; high-contrast, luminous whites (L=95%+), deep blacks (L=10–20%)
- Lighting System: Broncolor or Speedotron studio strobes; large softboxes (8–10 feet) for frontal even fill; minimal shadows; psychological flatness + detail preservation
- Darkroom Revision: Gideon Lewin (master printer) collaboration; precise exposure compensation; dodging (lighten specific zones) and burning (darken edges) for tonal shaping; form of visual pentimenti
- Large Print Output: Fiber-based prints 40–70 inches unmounted, pinned directly to wall; object-ness emphasized; raw presentation aesthetic

**Thematic Purpose:**
- Studio Portrait: Psychological confrontation; subject vulnerability/power revealed through gaze/expression; minimalism forces human presence (no artifice sanctuary)
- Fashion Editorial: Garment as narrative vehicle; model as dynamic presence (not static mannequin); movement/joy/vitality previously impossible in fashion
- West Portrait: Democratic dignity; occupational identity honored at monumental scale; margin becomes center; marginalized subject = equal artistic focus to celebrity

**Hallmark Motifs (Quantified):**
1. **White-Out Background (95–98% L neutral gray paper):** Eliminates all spatial context; psychological isolation technique; viewer focus absolute on face/body
2. **Frontal Studio Lighting (0–10° key light angle; 2:1–3:1 key:fill):** Even face illumination; minimal shadow modeling; detail maximum; emotional exposure maximum
3. **Large-Format Sharpness (8x10 negative detail):** Pore-level skin texture visible at print scale; unprecedented facial vulnerability (every wrinkle, every imperfection legible); psychological intimacy via technical precision
4. **High-Contrast Tonality (7–9 tonal steps per face; L floor 20–30%):** Dramatic modeling despite even lighting; dark eyes, shadow modeling in cheekbones; emotional intensity via tonal architecture
5. **Direct Psychological Gaze:** Eyes direct toward camera; no escape; confrontational intimacy; subject appears "found" not "posed"

**Period Framing:** Artist active 1945–2004; framework emphasizes peak period 1950–1985 (studio innovation through American West project).

**Tone Tag:** Confrontational authenticity; psychological intensity; technical mastery concealing artistry; minimalist aesthetic; democratic humanism.

**Production Era Authenticity:** 1950–1985 photographic standards: film-only workflow, large-format precision, darkroom chemical printing, no digital intervention, exhibition scale monumental prints.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

### WHITE BACKGROUND STUDIO PORTRAIT MODE

#### Context
Psychological portraiture via technical mastery and confrontational subject interaction. Subject positioned against seamless white backdrop; large-format camera on tripod; prolonged shooting (hundreds of frames) capturing moment between expressions—fatigue, vulnerability, or raw emotion. Gideon Lewin's darkroom printing achieves signature high-contrast tonality, luminous whites, velvety blacks. Avedon's ethos: "find the edges of what people could tolerate in the act of being photographed."

#### Measurements
- **Face Luminance (L%):** 65–75% (flesh tone); eyes L=30–50% (dark, psychologically dominant)
- **Background Luminance:** 95–98% L (seamless white paper, infinite recede)
- **Shadow Floor (darkest skin tones):** L=20–30% (cheekbones, under chin, eye sockets)
- **Highlight Ceiling:** L=95%+ (forehead, nose bridge, eye whites—blown acceptable, intentional)
- **Tonal Steps (face region):** 7–9 distinct value zones (maximum modeling despite even lighting)
- **Key Light Angle:** 0–10° from camera axis (overhead or directly frontal); minimal directional shadow
- **Key:Fill Lighting Ratio:** 2:1–3:1 (key light intensity 2–3× fill); produces fine shadow detail without full darkness
- **Focal Length (equivalent):** 85–135mm (compression flattens depth, isolates from background, flattering perspective)
- **Film Speed:** ISO 400 Kodak Tri-X; pushed to ISO 800–1600 acceptable (increased grain, enhanced contrast)
- **Grain Size (visible at print scale):** 0.2–0.4mm organic Tri-X grain (texture signature; humanizes digital coldness)
- **Sharpness (edge coefficient):** Surgical 0.95–1.0 (no softness; every pore, every wrinkle forensic clarity)
- **Print Size:** 40–70 inches unmounted (monumental presence; viewer physically dwarfed by subject)
- **Skin Texture Visibility:** Pore-resolve macro detail (epidermis topography documented; wrinkles/age/authenticity non-negotiable)

#### Technique
- **Large-Format Camera Setup:** 8x10 Deardorff mounted on tripod; tripod-locked composition; subject static; photographer controls timing, not subject movement
- **Studio Lighting Rig:** Broncolor or Speedotron strobe (1500W+ power); 8–10 foot white softbox positioned directly above subject at slight forward angle; fill reflector opposite side at 6–8 feet (reduces shadow severity while maintaining modeling); back rim light optional (subtle hair/edge separation, L=80–90%)
- **Exposure Protocol:** Auto-exposure locked; typically 200–400 frames per session (contact sheet shows hundreds of near-identical frames, Avedon circles decisive expression); shooting continues until subject exhaustion reveals authentic vulnerability
- **Darkroom Dodging & Burning:** Selective light exposure control during printing (dodging = lighten, burning = darken specific zones); forehead dodged slightly (maintain L=75–80%); eye sockets burned dark (L=25–35%, psychological intensity); edges burned subtly (L=85–92%, framing effect)
- **Tri-X Grain Signature:** Organic cubic grain visible at print surface; reinforces authenticity; no digital noise substitution
- **Print Chemistry:** Silver gelatin fiber-base; toning optional (selenium toning adds slight purplish cast, archival stability); matte or semi-gloss surface (no high-gloss reflection distraction)

#### Validation
- Face L% measures 65–75% (verify flesh tone lightness via histogram/measurement)
- Eyes render dark (L=30–50%) with clear pupillary highlight (L=80%+) and white sclera visible
- Shadow floor maintains L≥20% (no crushed blacks; detail legible in darkest zones)
- Tonal transitions smooth between value zones (no posterization; 7–9 distinct steps observable)
- Grain texture visible at print surface (confirms Tri-X signature; no digital smoothing present)
- Sharpness edge-to-edge razor (pores visible; no softness acceptable)
- White background reads pure white (L=95%+) without blown highlight distortion

#### Automated Corrections
- Cycle 1 baseline: Face rendering, lighting geometry, grain signature established
- Cycle 2+: If face L% drifts below 65%, increase key light intensity or reduce fill light; if eyes blow above L=50%, intensify burning or adjust exposure; if grain absent, verify Tri-X signature applied; if softness detected, recalibrate focus/sharpness parameters

### DYNAMIC FASHION EDITORIAL MODE

#### Context
Movement-enabled portraiture within fashion editorial tradition. Model positioned in location context (outdoor, café, circus, street); encouraged to jump, dance, laugh, interact with environment; fabric/garment as narrative element; dynamic diagonal or lateral composition; lighter tonality permits fashion color/texture integration; environmental context integral (not white-out isolation). Shooting rapid capture permits motion blur (acceptable unlike studio mode); multiple expressions per session (energy, joy, vitality priority).

#### Measurements
- **Face Luminance (L%):** 60–70% (slightly darker than studio; environment context permits variation)
- **Environmental Background:** 40–70% L (varied; location-dependent; sky, walls, objects create visual complexity)
- **Shadow Floor:** 15–25% (contextual darkness acceptable; not full crush)
- **Highlight Ceiling:** 85–90% (fabric/background blow acceptable; white garment L=90%+ permitted)
- **Tonal Steps (face):** 5–7 distinct zones (faster rendering than studio; movement priority over maximum modeling)
- **Key Light Angle:** 30–60° directional (lateral or three-quarter; creates depth, flatters movement direction)
- **Key:Fill Ratio:** 1:1–2:1 (fill-forward; shadows less pronounced; movement requires even overall exposure)
- **Focal Length (equivalent):** 35–85mm (environmental integration; less compression than studio; subjects contextually positioned)
- **Film Speed:** ISO 400 Kodak Tri-X (standard box speed); occasional push to ISO 800 for low-light outdoor work
- **Grain Size:** 0.2–0.4mm (Tri-X organic; visible but less critical than studio prints; movement + fashion texture priority)
- **Sharpness:** 0.85–0.95 (motion blur acceptable; action legible trumps forensic detail; pin-sharp optional)
- **Motion Blur:** Slight blur acceptable (up to 5–10% frame softness); captures kinetic energy, vitality; energy signature important
- **Print Size:** 11x14 to 20x24 inches (editorial/magazine scale); mounted or framed (presentation context differs from studio monumental)
- **Color Possibilities:** B&W Tri-X primary; color film (Kodak Portra 400) secondary option if skin tone warmth required

#### Technique
- **Medium-Format Camera (Rolleiflex or Nikon):** Handheld or on light tripod; permits subject freedom and movement; waist-level finder (Rolleiflex) enables dynamic angles
- **Outdoor Lighting Strategy:** Daylight primary (golden hour 3000–3500K warm; overcast 6000–7000K neutral); supplemental fill reflector (white or gold) optional; ambient light priority (natural soft quality)
- **Strobe Fill (conditional):** If harsh midday sun, fill flash 1:1 ratio (equal ambient + strobe); preserves environmental shadow depth while lifting subject
- **Shooting Protocol:** Rapid capture mode; hundreds of frames across multiple expressions; subject movement encouraged (jumping, walking, posed interaction); Avedon's directive: "make something happen" (animate the frame)
- **Motion Capture Timing:** Anticipate peak gesture/expression moment (apex of jump, widest smile, most dynamic arm extension); capture between frames where energy peaks
- **Fabric & Garment Integration:** Drape/flow rendered via motion (garment movement = visual narrative); light across fabric texture (herringbone, weave, sheen); tonal variation shows material authenticity
- **Environmental Integration:** Background objects/architecture frame composition; rule-of-thirds or diagonal energy guides positioning; spontaneity within structured composition
- **Grain Signature:** Organic Tri-X visible (fashion context permits slight softness; grain reinforces authenticity, counters retouching concerns)
- **Minimal Darkroom Revision:** Light dodging/burning acceptable (highlight fabrics, deepen shadows slightly); avoid heavy-handed manipulation (movement + spontaneity aesthetic priority)

#### Validation
- Face L% measures 60–70% (slightly darker than studio; environment context legible)
- Motion captured (movement blur ≤10% acceptable; action readable)
- Garment texture visible (fabric weave/drape legible; material authenticity rendered)
- Environmental context integrated (background objects frame composition; location recognizable)
- Tonal range 5–7 steps (no underexposure; detail legible throughout)
- Grain texture visible (Tri-X signature present; no digital smoothing)
- Composition dynamic (diagonal thrust, movement direction, kinetic energy evident)

#### Automated Corrections
- Cycle 1 baseline: Movement capture, fabric rendering, environmental integration established
- Cycle 2+: If face underexposed, increase fill light or lift shadows in burning; if motion blur excessive (>10%), tighten shutter speed expectation or reduce subject movement; if fabric texture lost, enhance edge sharpness on garment folds; if environmental context unclear, ensure background detail legible

### IN-THE-AMERICAN-WEST PORTRAIT MODE

#### Context
Democratic portraiture applied to occupational/marginal Americans (laborers, drifters, activists, ranchers). Portable seamless white backdrop (identical to studio format) transported to location; large-format technical mastery preserved; subject identity paramount (occupational authenticity non-negotiable); raw human presence; psychological intensity maximum. Five-year project (1979–1984) documented 400+ subjects; printing prioritized monumental scale (50–70 inches); exhibition context gallery-grade (MoMA, major retrospectives). Avedon's ethos: elevate margin to center; subject dignity via technical respect.

#### Measurements
- **Face Luminance (L%):** 60–75% (intentional variation; working-class subjects show age/weather; underexposure acceptable when psychologically authentic)
- **Background Luminance:** 90–96% L (portable studio white, slightly less pure than 8x10 studio; outdoor conditions permit minor ambient bleed)
- **Shadow Floor:** 10–20% (aggressive shadow depth acceptable; wrinkles, age, hardship documented unflinchingly; shadow modeling = psychological authenticity)
- **Highlight Ceiling:** 92–98% L (white background pure; minor environmental reflection acceptable)
- **Tonal Steps (face):** 8–10 distinct zones (maximum modeling via aggressive dodging/burning; wrinkle/texture detail = dignity marker)
- **Key Light Angle:** 0–15° (frontal or overhead; even illumination; personal isolation despite occupational context)
- **Key:Fill Ratio:** 2:1–3:1 (pronounced shadow modeling; emotional depth via tonal architecture)
- **Focal Length (equivalent):** 85–135mm (isolation from context; subject psychological separation maintained despite portable studio format)
- **Film Speed:** ISO 400 Kodak Tri-X; occasional push to ISO 1600 for cloud/shade outdoor work
- **Grain Size:** 0.2–0.4mm Tri-X (visible at monumental print scale; humanizes subjects; authenticity marker)
- **Sharpness (edge coefficient):** 0.95–1.0 (surgical; every wrinkle, scar, weathered detail forensic clarity; age rendered as dignity not deficit)
- **Motion Blur:** Zero (static poses; large-format stability; stillness emphasizes occupational/personal vulnerability)
- **Print Size:** 50–70 inches unmounted (monumental gallery scale; single-subject museum presentation; viewer psychological dwarfing)
- **Wrinkle/Age Detail:** Unsparing documentation (age markers visible; skin texture maximum; retouching prohibited; authenticity absolute)

#### Technique
- **Portable Studio Setup:** Seamless white paper backdrop (9–12 feet wide, curved to infinity effect); large-format camera (8x10 Deardorff or Graflex, depending on mobility); tripod-mounted composition; outdoor location (ranch, field, labor site, street)
- **Outdoor Lighting Rig:** Portable strobe system (Speedotron portable battery pack + flash heads) + large softbox (6–8 feet); identical studio light geometry despite field conditions; cloud reflector or fill alternative when strobe unavailable
- **Exposure Compensation:** Outdoor brightness requires exposure calculation; ISO 400 Tri-X typically metered for 1/30–1/60 second at f/5.6–f/8 (large format depth); strobe balanced to ambient (1:1 ratio fill typical)
- **Subject Interaction Protocol:** Avedon conducts extended conversation (30–120 minutes); no pose instruction; subject allowed authentic stance/expression; "find the edges" ethos applied: break subject's defenses through dialogue, humor, challenge; capture unguarded moment
- **Shooting Session:** 200+ frames typical per subject (large-format film consumption); multiple expressions, poses, emotional states; contact sheet editing (Avedon circles decisive frame; visible pentimenti via marking/crossing)
- **Grain Signature Emphasis:** Tri-X grain intentionally visible at monumental print scale (0.2–0.4mm grain texture humanizes photographic process; counters mechanical perfection; subject rendered with film medium's organic beauty)
- **Darkroom Revision (Maximum):** Aggressive dodging/burning (more than studio mode); forehead dodged to L=70–75%; eye sockets burned to L=15–25% (maximum psychological intensity); chin/jaw burned subtly (L=80–85%, modeling emphasis); edges burned framing effect (L=85–90%)
- **Print Presentation:** Unmounted fiber-based prints pinned directly to gallery wall; no frame, mat, or protective glass (raw presentation aesthetic); print object-ness emphasized; viewer proximity intimate despite monumental scale
- **Archival Paper & Chemistry:** Fiber-based silver gelatin (Oriental Seagull or Agfa Portriga); selenium toning optional (adds slight purplish cast, archival permanence 100+ years); matte surface standard

#### Validation
- Face L% measures 60–75% (variation acceptable; age/weather authenticity confirmed)
- Eye rendering dark (L=15–25% pupils; L=80%+ sclera; psychological intensity legible)
- Shadow floor maintains L≥10% (detail visible in darkest zones; wrinkle documentation uncompromised)
- Tonal transitions smooth (8–10 distinct steps; no posterization; gradual value modulation)
- Wrinkle/age detail forensic (skin texture visible at print scale; authenticity unretouched)
- Grain texture visible at print surface (Tri-X organic signature; confirms film medium authenticity)
- Sharpness surgical edge-to-edge (no softness; detail maximum)
- White background reads 90%+ L (portable studio white present; environmental bleed minimal)
- Unmounted presentation aesthetic legible (image feels object-like, raw, wall-direct)

#### Automated Corrections
- Cycle 1 baseline: Subject psychology, wrinkle documentation, tonal modeling, white background established
- Cycle 2+: If face underexposed (L<60%), increase key light or reduce fill; if wrinkles/age detail soft, increase sharpness/detail anchor; if background contaminated (environmental bleed >4%), intensify white background lighting or recompose subject against backdrop; if shadow floor crushed (L<10%), lighten shadows via reduced burning or increased fill; if grain absent, verify Tri-X signature applied throughout

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**TEMPORAL WARDROBE MANDATE:**

- **Artist Active Period:** 1945–2004; framework emphasizes 1950–1985
- **ALL wardrobe elements must predate or authentically represent 1950–1985 styles**
- **CRITICAL PROHIBITION:** No modern clothing retention from source images (jeans, hoodies, contemporary cuts REMOVED entirely)
- **Eyewear Anachronism Guard:** Eyeglasses permitted only if historically appropriate (1950–1985 frame styles authentically represented; no contemporary minimalist or oversized frames)
- **Complete Wardrobe Replacement Required:** All subjects fully redressed in period-accurate costume; no modern elements survive transformation

**ANACHRONISM VIOLATION EXAMPLES (MUST AVOID):**
- ❌ Modern sneakers, athletic wear, contemporary shoe styles
- ❌ Contemporary eyeglass frames (minimalist, oversized contemporary, titanium modern)
- ❌ Modern haircuts (undercuts, fades, contemporary women's layers)
- ❌ Contemporary accessories (smart watches, modern jewelry, designer logos post-1985)
- ❌ Synthetic fabrics (polyester visible sheen, spandex, nylon) if period predates synthetic availability
- ❌ Modern hairstyles (digital perms, contemporary color treatments)
- ❌ Contemporary makeup styles (matte lip trends, modern contouring)

**MODE-SPECIFIC WARDROBE TRACKS:**

### WHITE BACKGROUND STUDIO PORTRAIT MODE

- Hats: Fedora or cap optional (era-dependent); minimal use in studio portrait
- Eyewear: Period-appropriate frames (wayfarer, clubmaster, browline 1950s–70s; oversized 1980s); no contemporary minimalist or ultra-thin frames

**Feminine Accessories (1950–1985):**
- Jewelry: Necklace (pearl, gold chain, delicate pendant), earrings (studs, small hoops, chandelier 1980s), bracelets (minimal), rings (wedding + accent acceptable)
- Scarves: Silk scarf optional (tied at neck, wrist, or in hair); era-appropriate patterns
- Hats: Minimal in studio (no hat culture in Avedon portraits typically); occasional fascinator or headpiece (1950s formal)
- Eyewear: Period-appropriate frames (browline, oversized 1970s, thin metal 1980s); cat-eye acceptable (1950s–60s)
- Bags: Minimal in studio portrait (not visible typically); editorial fashion permits handbag visible
- Shoes: Visible only in full-body or seated portraits; heeled pump (1950s–70s) or flat (1970s+); minimal sneaker presence (only if authentically period-accurate early styles)

**Wardrobe Variation Required:**
- Change primary garment colors/styles between iterations (avoid identical repetition across test cycles)
- Cycle through period-appropriate palette (1950s soft pastels → 1960s brights → 1970s warm earth → 1980s jewel saturation)
- Vary garment construction details (necklines, sleeve length, lapel width) within period constraints
- Maintain gender-appropriate silhouettes throughout all variations

**HAIR TREATMENT — MANDATORY PRESERVATION AND PERIOD ADAPTATION:**

**CRITICAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Hair length MUST be preserved:** Short hair remains short; medium remains medium; long remains long
- **Hair color MUST be preserved:** Subject's natural hair color exactly matched
- **Baldness MUST be preserved:** Bald/balding subjects remain bald in period-appropriate manner
- **Facial hair presence MUST be preserved:** If subject clean-shaven, NO beards/stubble added; if bearded, maintain beard presence in period style

**PERIOD STYLING ADAPTATION (Preserving Length/Color/Presence):**

**Short Hair → Period Short Styles (preserving length):**
- 1950s: Crew cut, flattop, slicked-back gel style (masculine); tight waves, permanent wave "pin curls" released (feminine)
- 1960s: Minimal length change; Beatles-length acceptable (slightly longer crew cut); mod bob or pixie (feminine)
- 1970s: Feathered short (masculine); shag or layered short (feminine)
- 1980s: New wave or tapered fade (masculine); permed short or asymmetrical (feminine)

**Medium Hair → Period Medium Styles (preserving length):**
- 1950s: Slicked-back with pomade (masculine); victory rolls or finger waves (feminine)
- 1960s: Slightly longer on top (masculine); bouffant waves, beehive, or straight with flip (feminine)
- 1970s: Feathered sides, full on top (masculine); feathered or center-parted long-medium (feminine)
- 1980s: Permed/curled volume (masculine); big permed wave, asymmetrical, or straight (feminine)

**Long Hair → Period Long Styles (preserving length):**
- 1950s: Long and waved/curled (primarily feminine aesthetic); rare for masculine portraiture
- 1960s: Long straight or with soft waves (feminine); long hair masculine begins late 1960s (Beatles influence)
- 1970s: Long straight or softly permed/feathered (both genders acceptable); natural curls acceptable
- 1980s: Long straight, permed wave, or crimped (both genders); volume and body emphasized

**Bald/Balding → Period Baldness Presentation:**
- 1950s: Slicked scalp or bare head; head covering optional (hat worn indoors acceptable in formal setting)
- 1960s–70s: Bare head standard; no cover expected
- 1980s: Bare head standard; no cover expected
- Hair treatments (dyes, plugs, transplants) period-authentic only (modern treatments anachronistic)

**Facial Hair Mandate:**
- If subject clean-shaven: Maintain clean-shaven appearance (period-appropriate grooming); no stubble, no beard
- If subject has facial hair (beard/mustache): Style to period conventions (1950s thin mustaches, 1970s full beards, 1980s facial hair less prominent)
- DO NOT add facial hair where none exists
- DO NOT remove facial hair that exists
- Stubble acceptable only if subject naturally shows five-o'clock shadow (period-authentic presence)

**MODE-SPECIFIC HAIR TREATMENT (Maintaining preservation requirements across all modes):**

**White Background Studio Portrait Mode:**
- Masculine styling: Clean grooming; era-appropriate length/style; minimal product visible (natural or slicked)
- Feminine styling: Period-appropriate waves/styling; jewelry-visible ears acceptable (hair pulled back optional); volume and body period-dependent
- Headwear: Minimal (studio tradition excludes hats typically)

**Dynamic Fashion Editorial Mode:**
- Masculine styling: Windswept or movement-activated styling acceptable (hair in motion); voluminous 1980s style acceptable if period-authentic
- Feminine styling: Styled with movement in mind (waves, curls hold during jumping/walking); hair movement as narrative element acceptable
- Headwear: Period hats acceptable (1950s fascinator, 1970s beret, 1980s headband)

**In-the-American-West Portrait Mode:**
- Masculine styling: Working-class grooming (dust, sun-exposure appropriate); hat worn for occupational authenticity (cowboy hat, baseball cap period-appropriate); hair style practical (short, minimal styling)
- Feminine styling: Practical working-class styling (tied back, minimal product); hat acceptable (sun protection culturally authentic)
- Headwear: Occupational hats mandatory if subject-authentic (farmer, rancher, laborer typically wears hat)

**MODE-SPECIFIC GENDER-DIFFERENTIATED PROP POOLS:**

**White Background Studio Portrait Mode:**
- Masculine props: Minimal (studio aesthetic discourages objects); cigarette/cigar acceptable (1950s–70s); leather jacket optional (artistic subjects); watch visible acceptable
- Feminine props: Minimal; jewelry worn visible; handbag rare (not visible in studio portrait); hat minimal
- Occupational markers: Rare in white-background studio (exceptions: artist with brush, musician with instrument); authenticity balanced against minimalist aesthetic

**Dynamic Fashion Editorial Mode:**
- Masculine props: Fedora/cap (period hats); scarf optional; gloves (winter context); minimal other objects (hand placement priority over objects)
- Feminine props: Handbag (fashion editorial context); hat or headpiece period-appropriate; jewelry visible; flower or prop accessory context-dependent
- Fashion-contextual props: Bicycle, fence, chair, environmental objects for narrative staging (Avedon's fashion contextually rich)
- Temporal notes: 1950s–60s editorial permits more elaborate styling/props; 1970s–80s simpler props (minimalist fashion trend)

**In-the-American-West Portrait Mode:**
- Masculine props: Occupational tools (beekeeping equipment, ranch fence, agricultural implements, tools of trade); hat mandatory (sun protection, occupational marker); minimal jewelry (wedding ring visible acceptable)
- Feminine props: Similar occupational authenticity; hat if era-appropriate (sun hat, work cap); minimal jewelry
- Micro-props: Animals acceptable if occupational-authentic (dog for rancher, bees for beekeeper); tool-specific small objects (wrench, calipers, specimen container)
- Temporal notes: 1979–1984 rural American authenticity; props must reflect actual occupational practice (no decorative anachronisms)

**Temporal Prop Validation:**

- Cross-reference ALL props against artist's active period (1950–1985 framework)
- Verify technology level (no items requiring post-1985 invention)
- Confirm social appropriateness (gender + class + period conventions)
- Remove any modern objects from source images completely

**Setting Authenticity:**

**White Background Studio Portrait Mode:**
- Architecture: Seamless white paper backdrop (curved to infinity); studio wall background (neutral); white paper priority
- Furniture: Minimal (studio stool optional); chair acceptable (period-appropriate); background furniture rare
- Environmental details: None (white-out background purpose is environmental elimination)
- NO modern backgrounds retained from source images
- Mode-specific setting: Controlled studio environment (white infinity, consistent lighting, neutral everything)

**Dynamic Fashion Editorial Mode:**
- Architecture: Outdoor locations (café, street, park, circus, architectural sites); period-appropriate buildings; environmental narrative integration
- Furniture: Street furniture (café chair, bench); environmental objects (fence, lamp post) context-appropriate
- Environmental details: Trees, vegetation, crowds (background), vehicles (period cars, not modern); street signage (period typography, not contemporary)
- Setting establishes narrative context (fashion story location-dependent)
- Mode-specific: Location authenticity mandatory (Parisian café 1950s vs. New York street 1980s must visually cohere)

**In-the-American-West Portrait Mode:**
- Architecture: Landscape (desert, ranch, field, street); minimal structures (fence, barn, simple building); natural or working landscape
- Furniture: None (standing pose typical in landscape); rare sitting (rock, ground)
- Environmental details: Minimal (sky, ground, sparse vegetation); occupational context visible peripherally (ranch fence, agricultural field)
- Setting = American West occupational authenticity (geographic/socioeconomic context apparent)
- Mode-specific: Rural authenticity mandatory (period-accurate working landscape; no modernized/gentrified backgrounds)

**Coherence Filter:**
- All elements support declared style/period with documented historical accuracy
- Fallback = clean white background with minimal period-appropriate elements
- When uncertain about temporal accuracy: OMIT rather than risk anachronism

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (Applied to Final Ratio After Potential Adaptation):**

**White Background Studio Portrait Mode (3:4 Native Vertical):**
- Vertical Emphasis: Subject dominates vertically; head positioned upper third (psychological prominence); shoulders/torso lower two-thirds
- Figure Dominance: 50–70% of vertical frame; face occupies 40–50%; white negative space breathing room
- Hierarchical Staging: Face primary focus (lightest rendering, sharpest detail); torso secondary; white background tertiary (pure neutrality)
- Lighting Logic: Frontal key (0–10° angle) creates even face illumination; fill ratio 2:1–3:1 establishes shadow modeling; zero environmental light competing
- Detail:Negative Space: Maximum detail face region; negative white space frames subject; ratio enforces psychological isolation

**Dynamic Fashion Editorial Mode (4:3 Native Landscape):**
- Horizontal Flow: Subject positioned left/center; compositional momentum left-to-right or diagonal thrust
- Environmental Context: 40–65% background/environment; 35–50% subject; location narrative legible
- Figure Placement: Off-center or diagonal (rule-of-thirds energy); movement direction implies action/energy
- Lighting Logic: Directional key (30–60° angle) flatters motion direction; fill ratio 1:1–2:1 reduces shadow severity; environmental shadow acceptable
- Detail:Negative Space: Moderate detail (face/garment texture legible); environmental negative space proportional to narrative (background context important)
- Compositional Movement: Diagonal thrust, leading lines, gesture direction energy

**In-the-American-West Portrait Mode (3:4 Native Vertical):**
- Vertical Emphasis: Identical to studio mode compositionally; subject monumental vertically
- Figure Dominance: 50–70% frame; face occupies 40–50%; white background framing
- Hierarchical Staging: Face primary; occupational identity secondary (body language, hands, clothing communicate labor); white background tertiary
- Lighting Logic: Frontal key (0–15° angle) provides even illumination; fill ratio 2:1–3:1 aggressive shadow modeling; psychological intensity via tonal architecture
- Detail:Negative Space: Maximum detail (wrinkles, age, occupational markers); white space isolation (margin becoming center via monumental scale)
- Compositional Anchors: Psychological isolation despite occupational authenticity; subject centered; environmental context eliminated via white backdrop

---

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (Mode-Differentiated):**

**White Background Studio Portrait Mode — Composition:**
- Perspective Regime: Frontal/parallel (zero foreshortening); subject faces camera directly
- Grid/Symmetry: Bilateral symmetry acceptable (frontal pose); slight 45° asymmetry acceptable (three-quarter angle)
- Figure:Ground %: 50–70% subject; 30–50% white background
- Density %: 50–70% visual information (face/body); 30–50% empty white space
- Lighting Logic: Frontal even illumination (minimalist shadow architecture) to aggressive 3D modeling (deep cheekbone shadows)
- Detail:Negative Space Ratio: Maximum detail face; negative space proportional to psychological breathing
- Camera Angle: Level or overhead slightly (eye-contact or looking-down vulnerability)

**Dynamic Fashion Editorial Mode — Composition:**
- Perspective Regime: Environmental depth (foreground/midground/background legible); location context authentic
- Framing Regime: Seamless integration (subject flows into environment) or contrasted (subject pops from background via tone/focus)
- Lens Equivalent: 35–85mm (environmental compression moderate; subject isolated but contextualized)
- Film/Stock Anchor: Kodak Tri-X B&W or Portra color (forgiving latitude for outdoor variable light)
- Figure:Ground %: 35–50% subject; 50–65% environment
- Density %: 50–70% visual information (varied environmental detail + subject focus)
- Lighting Logic: Directional key (30–60° angle) + fill reflector or ambient bounce; shadow ratios 1:1–2:1 permit environmental shadow depth
- Detail:Negative Space Ratio: Moderate detail face; environmental negative space tells narrative

**In-the-American-West Portrait Mode — Composition:**
- Perspective Regime: Frontal isolation (parallel to white backdrop); occupational environment peripherally visible (ranch fence edge, field horizon) or absent
- Framing Regime: Seamless white integration (portable studio); subject isolated + elevated to monumental status
- Lens Equivalent: 85–135mm (compression flattens depth; subject psychologically isolated)
- Film/Stock Anchor: Kodak Tri-X 8x10 large format (maximum detail capture; field conditions managed)
- Figure:Ground %: 50–70% subject (monumental prominence); 30–50% white background (portable studio)
- Density %: 50–70% visual information (face + occupational markers/body language); 30–50% white breathing space
- Lighting Logic: Frontal key (0–15° angle) + portable strobe fill; shadow ratios 2:1–3:1 aggressive modeling; psychological intensity maximum
- Detail:Negative Space Ratio: Maximum detail face (wrinkles, age, authenticity); occupational identity markers visible (tools, clothing, posture); white space elevates margin

---

**UNIVERSAL COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS (All Modes):**

**Surface Context Anchor:** Seamless white paper backdrop (studio/West) or environmental location (fashion)
- Studio: White paper curved to infinity; neutral surface (human presence primary)
- Fashion: Outdoor/interior location (café, street, architectural); environmental texture visible
- West: Portable white paper (occupational landscape peripherally integrated)

**Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely (photography tradition excludes decorative framing)
- No mat, no border, no decorative edge treatment
- Composition composed edge-to-edge
- Print presentation raw (unmounted, pinned to wall)

**Production Context Anchor:** Silver gelatin fiber-based printing; darkroom dodging/burning; period-accurate darkroom methods (1950–1985)
- No modern inkjet substitution
- No digital post-processing filters
- Tonal control via darkroom technique (dodging lightens; burning darkens)
- Grain structure Tri-X organic (visible at print scale)

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for FINAL declared ratio (no lazy cropping or adaptation)
- 3:4 studio/West: Vertical emphasis, face dominance, white framing
- 4:3 fashion: Horizontal flow, environmental integration, movement composition

**Gender Expression Anchor:** Pose and gesture maintain subject's presented gender identity across all modes
- Masculine subject: Masculine styling (hair, clothing, jewelry), stance, gesture consistency
- Feminine subject: Feminine styling (hair, clothing, jewelry), stance, gesture consistency
- Cross-mode consistency enforced (same subject different modes = identical gender expression presentation)

**Mode-Specific Composition Anchor:** Each mode applies distinct compositional conventions
- Studio: Psychologically isolated, minimalist, frontal
- Fashion: Narratively integrated, environmental, dynamic
- West: Monumental isolation, occupational authenticity, psychological depth
