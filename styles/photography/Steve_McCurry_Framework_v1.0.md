about: >
  Steve McCurry (b. 1950) pioneered color photojournalism through decades covering global conflict, cultural documentation, and humanistic portraiture. His signature approach combines golden-hour natural lighting, saturated Kodachrome color palette, and profound empathy for subjects, creating images that transcend reporting to achieve fine art resonance. This framework captures his three primary working modes: intimate psychological portraiture, cultural-contextual documentation, and landscape-scale environmental integration. Active 1979-present; Magnum member since 1986.

# Steve McCurry Framework v1.0 — NanoBanana Edition

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]**—ignore source image dimensions completely.
- **Ratio Enforcement (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **[X:Y]**. Hard requirement.
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement Protocol:** Explicit ratio declaration in multiple prompt locations (Section 1, Section 2, Section 6). Negative constraints explicitly prohibiting unwanted ratios. Compositional anchors designed specifically for target ratio.
- **Style Dominance:** McCurry signature over technical perfection. Likeness via facial architecture, pose authenticity, environmental context.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language.
- **Material Authenticity Priority:** Film-era Kodachrome characteristics (saturated, fine-grained, warm) non-negotiable for Close Portrait mode; golden-hour warm color temperature mandatory across all modes.
- **Golden Hour Mandate:** Color temperature 3000-4500K (warm directional light). Midday harsh light prohibited except deliberate environmental inclusion.
- **Process Priority:** Natural light capture methodology, observational patience, subject intimacy overrides convenience.
- **Anti-Digital Bias:** No digital smoothing, no HDR, no contemporary photo filters. Grain presence mandatory (Kodachrome signature).
- **Gender Expression Authority:** Preserve subject's presented gender identity through period-appropriate styling. Cross-mode consistency required.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `diffusion-soft` (golden hour natural diffusion); `film-grain-triX` (fine organic grain)
- **Pose Flags:** `contrapposto` (primary, 70% frequency); `seated-formal` (secondary); `contemplative` (psychological state)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` (recompose environment to fill declared ratio)
- **STRICT TERMINATION:** Framework ends at Section 8. NO commentary, NO explanations, NO content beyond Section 8.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]** (3:4 portrait / 4:3 landscape / 2:3 vertical) — ignore source image dimensions completely.
- **RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **[X:Y]**. This is a hard requirement.
- Redraw in **Steve McCurry documentary portraiture** for **[specific mode name]**.
- Identity via facial architecture, pose authenticity, direct psychological presence.
- **Gender Expression Mandate:** Preserve subject's presented gender identity through authentic costuming. Male subjects remain masculine across all modes, female subjects remain feminine across all modes.
- **CRITICAL COLOR REQUIREMENT:** Golden-hour warm color temperature (3000-4500K) mandatory. No cool/blue casts except deliberate environmental cool-shadow integration.
- **CRITICAL GRAIN REQUIREMENT:** Fine organic film grain visible throughout (Kodachrome signature). NO digital smoothing, NO HDR, NO contemporary filters. Grain is aesthetic requirement, not defect.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original human subjects with authentic cultural costuming appropriate to declared mode; avoid recognizable public figures; preserve ethical documentary approach.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `diffusion-soft` (golden hour natural light diffusion); `film-grain-organic` (Kodachrome-characteristic luminance grain)
- **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto` (Close Intimate Portrait mode); `environmental-standing` (Cultural Documentary mode); `landscape-integration` (Landscape with Figure mode)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend`
- **Mode Selector:** [Close Intimate Portrait / Cultural Documentary / Landscape with Figure] — specify which single mode applies.
- **Final Ratio Confirmation:** Output must be exactly **[X:Y ratio]**, no exceptions.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**NANOBANANA SUPPORTED RATIOS (Native — No Adaptation Required):**

- ✅ `3:4` (portrait — 864×1184) — Close Intimate Portrait primary
- ✅ `4:3` (landscape — 1184×864) — Landscape with Figure primary
- ✅ `2:3` (portrait — 832×1248) — Cultural Documentary vertical variant

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** Choose one exact specification above. All three modes support native ratios; no adaptation required.

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY (Mode-specific):**

**Close Intimate Portrait (3:4 or 2:3):**
- Ratio Status: Native
- Reframing Method: Crop and center subject; discard distracting backgrounds
- Spatial Allocation: Face occupies 70-85% of frame; background 15-30% (soft bokeh or neutral color)
- Background Treatment: Creamy bokeh (#D8D8D8 neutral gray or muted sky blue #A8C5DD); no environmental clutter
- Format Justification: Vertical portrait emphasizes facial presence; intimate psychological focus

**Cultural Documentary (4:3 or 2:3 vertical):**
- Ratio Status: Native
- Reframing Method: Extend environment; recompose to include contextual architecture/landscape
- Spatial Allocation: Subject 30-50% frame; environment 50-70% (legible detail, narrative context)
- Background Treatment: Architectural elements, landscape, cultural markers integrated; depth layers visible
- Format Justification: Horizontal or vertical accommodates environmental narrative; subject integrated into place

**Landscape with Figure (4:3 landscape):**
- Ratio Status: Native
- Reframing Method: Expand environment dramatically; reduce figure scale (15-30% frame)
- Spatial Allocation: Terrain/architecture 60-70%; figure positioned for compositional balance
- Background Treatment: Mountainous/vast landscape dominates; figure provides human scale reference
- Format Justification: Widescreen emphasizes environmental vastness; figure becomes scale marker within expansive context

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Henri Cartier-Bresson (observational patience, decisive moment); Sebastião Salgado (humanistic documentary); color photojournalism pioneers (transition from B&W to chromatic saturation)

**Medium/Production Method:** Film-era Kodachrome 64/200 (1979-2009); Fujichrome transition (2010-2015); digital RAW (2015-present). Framework targets **Kodachrome aesthetic** across all modes: saturated yet natural color, fine grain, warm color temperature, high contrast, excellent shadow detail.

**Thematic Purpose:** Document human dignity in conflict zones, cultural documentation, environmental integration. Humanistic focus over pure reporting; psychological presence of subject paramount.

**Hallmark Motifs (Quantified):**
1. **Golden Hour Directional Lighting** — Key light 45° angle; 2:1 to 3:1 key:fill ratio; 3000-4500K color temperature; shadow floor L≥22%
2. **Saturated Regional Color Palette** — Warm earth tones (#D4A574, #8B6F47) plus high-saturation cultural textile colors (#E74C3C reds, #229B88 teals); S=50-80% environmental; flesh S=35-55% preserved naturalism
3. **Intimate Facial Architecture** — Eyes 18-22% of face width; direct or introspective gaze; flesh tone H=15-35°, L=65-75%; fine grain visible throughout
4. **Environmental Integration** — Subject off-center (40-50° angle); 2-3 depth layers; background legible but supportive (not dominant); aerial perspective color recession
5. **Observational Authenticity** — Candid presence; natural poses (contrapposto 70% frequency); authentic costuming; no staged perfection; grain texture preserved as documentary marker

**Period Framing:** Active 1979-present; film era dominance 1979-2009; digital transition 2009-present. Framework targets **film-era aesthetic** regardless of output medium.

**Tone Tag:** Humanistic dignity, psychological depth, warm color saturation, golden-hour nostalgia, observational patience.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Kodachrome film characteristics (warm saturation, fine grain, contrast) non-negotiable. If digital output, simulate Kodachrome rendering (not contemporary digital flatness).

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

### Close Intimate Portrait

#### Context
Extreme close-up psychological portraiture capturing individual presence and vulnerability. Subject fills 70-85% of frame. Golden-hour side-lighting creates dimensional facial modeling. Background soft, neutral (bokeh or solid color). Psychological intimacy through direct gaze or introspective downward angle. Fine film grain visible throughout.

#### Measurements

- Aperture f/2.0-f/2.8 (shallow DOF; subject isolated from background; bokeh creamy undercorrected)
- Golden hour positioning: Key light side-oriented (45° angle); shadow side 70-80% fill ratio
- Fill light source: Natural ambient reflection (not strobe); warm temperature preservation
- Head positioning: -10° to +15° vertical tilt (introspective vulnerability or engaged confidence); slight forward chin extension (1-3 inches, jawline definition)
- Pose: Contrapposto subtle (60/40 weight if standing; if seated, upright 85-90° spine angle)
- Surface treatment: Matte to semi-matte finish (C-type print or Kodachrome characteristic); no glossy sheen
- Color grading: Film stock signature; minimal post-correction; warm cast preserved; no color shift toward cool/blue
- Retouching degree: Light (dust/hair removal only); blemishes preserved as authenticity markers; skin texture visible; minimal clone-stamp usage

#### Validation

- Male styling: Period-appropriate short/medium styling; maintain subject's actual length; cultural authenticity
- Female styling: Period-appropriate styling maintaining subject's length; head covering if culturally appropriate; face-frame clarity for intimate framing
- Headwear conventions: Traditional when culturally appropriate; head covering supports portrait intimacy and cultural authenticity

**Cultural Documentary — Hair Styling:**
- Male styling: Distinct period-appropriate styling for this mode maintaining length; occupational context appropriate
- Female styling: Distinct period styling maintaining length; working context may show practical styling (braids, wraps)
- Headwear conventions: Different from portrait mode; working context appropriate

**Landscape with Figure — Hair Styling:**
- Male styling: Regional traditional styling maintaining length; outdoor/environmental context appropriate
- Female styling: Regional traditional styling maintaining length; weather/terrain context practical

- Remove ANY modern objects from source images completely
- Mode-appropriate context (portrait props differ fundamentally from landscape props)

**Setting Authenticity:**
- Architecture matches region and era (no anachronistic buildings)
- Interiors/exteriors regionally authentic (furnishings, architectural styles, materials)
- Environmental details (vegetation, terrain, climate markers) regionally consistent
- NO modern backgrounds retained from source images
- Mode-specific settings (intimate interior for portrait mode, expansive landscape for landscape mode, cultural context for documentary mode)

**Coherence Filter:**
- All elements support declared style/region with documented authenticity
- Fallback = clean scene with minimal authentic elements
- When uncertain: OMIT rather than risk anachronism

- "direct psychological presence" — humanistic emphasis
- "observational authenticity" — ethical documentary approach

**Vocabulary Warnings:**
- AVOID "polished," "perfected," "flawless" → anti-documentary authenticity
- AVOID "studio," "controlled," "perfect lighting" → documentary natural light mandate
- AVOID "smooth skin," "airbrushed," "retouched" → anti-contemporary smoothing
- AVOID "modern," "contemporary," "digital aesthetic" → Kodachrome film signature mandate

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS (Mode-dependent):**

**Close Intimate Portrait (3:4, 2:3):**
- Vertical emphasis, face dominance 70-85%, hierarchical staging intimate (background minimal/neutral)
- Face centered or slight off-center (not forced asymmetry; natural framing)
- Shoulders/neck visible; environmental context eliminated
- Psychological intimacy via lighting (45° golden hour) and direct/introspective gaze

**Cultural Documentary (4:3, 2:3):**
- Horizontal or vertical balance, subject 30-50%, environment 50-70%
- Subject off-center (compositional rule-of-thirds); environment balances frame
- 2-3 depth planes; architectural/landscape context supports narrative
- Psychological integration: subject within cultural place

**Landscape with Figure (4:3):**
- Horizontal expansive, subject 15-30%, terrain 60-70%
- Subject positioned as tertial anchor (not central); compositional balance via landscape asymmetry
- 3-4 depth planes; atmospheric recession; scale emphasis
- Psychological impact: individual within vast context

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (Mode-differentiated):**

**Close Intimate Portrait — Composition:**
- Framing regime: Head-on focus, minimal distraction, background bokeh or solid neutral
- Focal length equivalent: 85-105mm (flattering perspective, minimal distortion, creamy bokeh)
- Lighting logic: 45° golden hour key; 2:1-3:1 fill; shadow floor L≥22%
- Figure:ground ratio: 70-85% face : 15-30% background
- Density: Minimal visual noise; subject isolation priority

**Cultural Documentary — Composition:**
- Framing regime: Environmental inclusion, contextual narrative, legible architectural/landscape detail
- Focal length equivalent: 35-50mm (environmental context, minimal distortion)
- Lighting logic: Golden hour warm directional; 2:1-3:1 fill; atmospheric depth
- Figure:ground ratio: 30-50% subject : 50-70% environment
- Density: Balanced; background detail meaningful not decorative

**Landscape with Figure — Composition:**
- Framing regime: Environmental vastness, figure as scale reference, dramatic landscape
- Focal length equivalent: 24-35mm (wide context, slight distortion acceptable)
- Lighting logic: Dramatic golden hour; long shadows; 2:1-4:1 fill; high contrast
- Figure:ground ratio: 15-30% subject : 60-70% environment
- Density: Expansive; negative space dominant; figure compositionally anchoring

**UNIVERSAL COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Natural outdoor environment (landscape, architecture, cultural setting); clean artifact without frames/borders/mounting hardware
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely (documentary authenticity mandate; no artistic frames or borders; subject integral to composition)
- **Production Context Anchor:** Golden-hour natural light primary; no studio setting; film-era aesthetic (Kodachrome saturation, fine grain, warm color temperature)
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for declared ratio (final adapted ratio if applicable); no padding/letterboxing; recomposition mandatory
- **Gender Expression Anchor:** Pose and gesture patterns preserve subject's gender identity using region-appropriate conventions; cross-mode consistency maintained
- **Mode-Specific Composition Anchor:** Close Portrait intimate background elimination; Cultural Documentary environmental integration; Landscape with Figure scale dramatization

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Omit text entirely. McCurry documentary photography does not integrate typography.
