about: >
  Walter Iooss Jr. (b. 1943) is the preeminent sports photographer of the modern era,
  with five decades at Sports Illustrated establishing the visual language of athletic
  excellence. His work synthesizes documentary precision with humanistic portraiture,
  capturing athletes at peak physical and emotional intensity. The framework preserves
  his signature aesthetics: Kodak Ektachrome color science (film era), Nikon digital
  warmth (contemporary), dramatic yet natural lighting, telephoto compression, and
  the decisive moment philosophy. Period-authentic from 1961 to present.

# Walter Iooss Jr. — Museum-Grade Photography Framework v1.0 (NanoBanana Edition)

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint Precedence & Authority:**
- Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier sections override later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Renderer Adaptation:** When target ratio unsupported, apply nearest-match adaptation per Section 2.1.

**NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement Protocol:**
Aspect ratio control is prompt-based only. Model may resist ratio instructions and default to non-standard outputs. Combat through:
- **Explicit multi-location declarations** of target ratio in multiple prompt sections
- **Repetitive reinforcement** using different phrasings (exact aspect ratio, dimensional specifications, compositional framing for X:Y)
- **Negative constraints** explicitly prohibiting unwanted ratios
- **Compositional anchors** designed specifically for target ratio (e.g., "landscape 16:9 requires 60% subject width")

**Technical Measurement Authority:**
Quantitative specifications override descriptive language. **Authoritative numeric anchors:** contrast ratio 6.92x, shadow floor 44±37, highlight ceiling 178±46, edge softness coefficient ≥0.97, grain presence 54±15, color warm offset +17, saturation 46/100, tonal zones ≥10.

**Material Authenticity Priority:**
Film stock (Kodak Ektachrome), digital sensor (Nikon D5/D6), and era-specific processing techniques supersede aesthetic convenience. **Film grain authenticity:** directional grain visible in shadows, subtle in highlights, consistent std.dev 54. **Digital grain authenticity:** diagonal CMOS axis orientation, uniform distribution, ISO-dependent. No algorithmic texture overlays.

**Process-Over-Result Priority:**
How materials are applied (film development, strobe placement, darkroom/digital workflow, white balance setting, shutter speed selection) supersedes visual appearance descriptions alone. Specify equipment, angles, power levels, ISO settings, focal lengths explicitly.

**Photographic Face-Treatment Flags (mandatory selection):**
- `film-grain-authentic-ektachrome` | `digital-grain-authentic-nikon` | `diffusion-soft-natural` | `dramatic-strobe-modeling` | `natural-light-preservation` | `darkroom-analog-toned` | `color-graded-analog-method`

**Pose Flags (choose one or more):**
`candid-motion` | `peak-action-intensity` | `contemplative-introspection` | `gestural-authenticity` | `kinetic-tension` | `power-stance` | `psychological-access`

**Canvas Control Flag:**
`strict-reframe` (mandatory for all modes)

**Material Physics Authority:**
Film stock, lens focal length (telephoto 200–600mm for action; 50–105mm for portrait), strobe power/distance, sensor ISO specifications, and aperture choice (f/2.8–f/5.6 action, f/2.8–f/4.0 portrait, f/5.6–f/11 environmental) override aesthetic preferences.

**Scale-Dependent Technique:**
Magazine reproduction (halftone, 65–85 lpi screen) differs from fine-art print (continuous tone); viewing distance at arm's length affects grain visibility and tonal separation clarity.

**Quantifiers Authoritative:**
Numeric anchors (6.92x contrast ratio, 0.977 softness coefficient, +17 color offset, 44±37 shadow floor, 178±46 highlight ceiling) are targets; deviations >10% trigger forensic re-scoring.

**Text Policy:**
Only render text if Section 8 authorizes. No Sports Illustrated logo exact replication; no magazine mastheads.

**Safety/IP Hardlines:**
No nudity; no exact copyrighted image pixel-matching replication; athlete dignity preserved; period authenticity enforced (±2 years from stated context); no defamatory composites.

**Age & Gender Guardrails:**
Default to adult neutral; no minors. Preserve subject's presented gender identity with period-appropriate athletic styling; consistency across all three modes.

**Material Authenticity Prohibition:**
No digital smoothing filters; no Instagram effects; no AI beautification (skin smoothing, face enhancement); surface must exhibit authentic film grain, sensor artifacts, or darkroom technique marks.

**Period Production Authenticity:**
1961–1975 (Ektachrome primary, mechanical camera, darkroom craft), 1975–2005 (hybrid film/digital transition, autofocus adoption, early digital editing), 2005–present (full digital, warm ISO push aesthetic, Lightroom color grading, archival inkjet printing).

**Composition Boundaries:**
No frames outside canvas; no artificial borders, watermarks, or credits visible in final image.

**Mode Consistency Authority:**
Subject's gender presentation, core anatomical characteristics, and identity markers remain consistent across all three operational modes.

**Failure Mode Prevention:**
Avoid genre drift (no anime aesthetics, no HDR smoothing, no digital beautification filters, no contemporary UI overlays, no impossible physics).

**STRICT TERMINATION:**
Framework ends at Section 8. NO commentary, explanations, historical context, or content beyond Section 8.

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly the declared mode aspect ratio — ignore source image dimensions completely.

**RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of mode ratio. This is a hard requirement. Do not default to non-standard outputs.

Render athlete in **Walter Iooss Jr. sports photography style**, emphasizing his signature approach to capturing athletes at peak physical and emotional intensity through **decisive moment capture**, **humanistic subject focus**, and **dramatic yet natural lighting**.

**Identity Mandate:** Preserve subject's presented gender identity through period-appropriate athletic styling; consistency across all modes.

**Critical Flags (MANDATORY PRESENCE):**
- `film-stock-authenticity` (Ektachrome or Nikon D5 digital equivalent)
- `documentary-precision` (sharp-focus moment capture, not staged recreation)
- `athlete-centric-framing` (subject dominance, environment secondary)
- `kinetic-energy` (implied motion, tensioned pose, action intent visible)
- `professional-lighting-control` (key/fill/rim coordination, shadows readable, modeling visible)

**Anti-Flags (FORBIDDEN):**
- `digital-smoothing` (no AI beautification; retain film grain authenticity)
- `contemporary-abstraction` (no stylized distortion; maintain photojournalistic fidelity)
- `generic-sports-photography` (avoid clichéd angles/expressions)
- `anachronistic-materials` (no post-2024 camera tech in pre-2024 contexts)
- `flat-lighting` (shadows must show intentional modeling, not safety-light fallback)

**Face-Treatment Flag Selection:** [artist chooses one based on era] `film-grain-authentic-ektachrome` (1961–1995) OR `digital-grain-authentic-nikon` (2005–present) OR `diffusion-soft-natural` (portrait mode any era)

**Pose Flag Selection:** `candid-motion` (action mode) | `contemplative-introspection` (portrait mode) | `gestural-authenticity` (environmental mode)

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance:** Photographic authenticity and material fidelity supersede stylistic flourish.

**Mode Selection & Ratio Declaration:**
- **Mode 1: Dynamic Action Sports** — Aspect ratio **16:9 (mandatory)**, Telephoto landscape compression, subject 40–70% frame width, off-center composition
- **Mode 2: Intimate Athletic Portrait** — Aspect ratio **3:4 or 2:3 (mandatory)**, Head-shoulders framing, subject 30–50% frame height, subtle asymmetry
- **Mode 3: Decisive Moment Environmental** — Aspect ratio **4:3 (mandatory)**, Balanced athlete-environment, both in focus, asymmetric rule-of-thirds

**Final Ratio Confirmation:** Output must be exactly [declared mode ratio], no exceptions.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**NANOBANANA SUPPORTED RATIOS (Native — No Adaptation Required):**

✅ `1:1` (square)
✅ `2:3` (portrait tall)
✅ `3:2` (landscape wide)
✅ `3:4` (portrait classic) — MODE 2 PRIMARY
✅ `4:3` (landscape classic) — MODE 3 PRIMARY
✅ `4:5` (portrait elegant)
✅ `5:4` (landscape square-adjacent)
✅ `9:16` (portrait vertical cinema)
✅ `16:9` (landscape widescreen) — MODE 1 PRIMARY
✅ `21:9` (ultra-wide panoramic)

**MODE-SPECIFIC RATIO MANDATE:**

**Dynamic Action Sports:** Primary `16:9` (landscape); Secondary `3:2`
**Intimate Athletic Portrait:** Primary `3:4` (portrait); Secondary `2:3` or `4:5`
**Decisive Moment Environmental:** Primary `4:3` (landscape); Secondary `3:4`

**RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana Critical):**
Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of declared mode. This is a hard requirement. Use explicit multi-location declarations, repetitive reinforcement with varied phrasing, negative constraints prohibiting unwanted ratios, compositional anchors designed for target ratio.

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

**Mode 1 — Dynamic Action Sports (16:9 Primary)**
- **Ratio Status:** Native 16:9 supported; no adaptation required
- **Reframing Method:** Subject occupies 40–70% frame width; landscape orientation mandatory
- **Spatial Allocation:** Athlete positioned off-center or on dynamic action trajectory axis; environment secondary (bokeh/blur)
- **Background Treatment:** Telephoto compression; out-of-focus crowd/arena/venue blur; optical bokeh (7–9 blade aperture character); no recognizable detail
- **Format Justification:** Magazine spreads, SI editorial, fine-art landscape print; telephoto compression authentic to Iooss's action photography

**Mode 2 — Intimate Athletic Portrait (3:4 or 2:3 Primary)**
- **Ratio Status:** Native 3:4 and 2:3 both supported; select one for consistency
- **Reframing Method:** Tight head-shoulders framing; portrait orientation mandatory
- **Spatial Allocation:** Head occupies 30–50% frame height; left-of-center or subtle asymmetry (never dead center)
- **Background Treatment:** Controlled neutral gradient or studio bokeh; no environmental detail; soft separation
- **Format Justification:** SI Swimsuit Issue, portrait studies, gallery exhibitions; classic portrait tradition

**Mode 3 — Decisive Moment Environmental (4:3 Primary)**
- **Ratio Status:** Native 4:3 supported; no adaptation required
- **Reframing Method:** Balanced asymmetric composition; athlete ~45–50% frame, environment ~30–40%, negative space ~20%
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject and environmental landmark both in focus; integrated visual hierarchy
- **Background Treatment:** Moderate depth-of-field (f/5.6–f/11); venue architecture or natural landscape legible; decisional compositional framing
- **Format Justification:** Editorial context photography, environmental integration, Sports Illustrated magazine covers

------

### 2.1) Ratio Compliance & Renderer Adaptation

**TRIGGER:** This section applies ONLY when historical specialty ratio requested but unsupported by NanoBanana.

**Adaptation Protocol:** Not required for this framework (all declared ratios native to NanoBanana). Reference template only.

If future modifications require adaptation: Preserve orientation, figure dominance intent, viewing tradition. Portrait adaptations → `3:4` or `2:3`. Landscape adaptations → `16:9` or `21:9`. Square → `4:3`. **Strict Reframe Mandate:** No letterboxing, pillarboxing, padding, or distortion. Clean recomposition required. **Composition Compensation:** Adjust figure prominence %, depth compression, visual hierarchy zones.

- Location context: park, beach, architectural landmark (controlled, not competitive environment)
- Background neutral (no crowds, no active competition, no venue distraction)
- Soft bokeh or featureless gradient
- Lighting: controlled key/fill setup (studio characteristics visible in lighting quality)

**Decisive Moment Environmental Mode:**
- Integrated venue (tennis court with lines, stadium seating, golf course fairway)
- Architectural landmark visible (building, natural formation)
- Competition or practice context
- Athlete position integrated with environmental feature (at net, on tee, in arena)
- Time-of-day authenticity (morning, afternoon, evening lighting)
- Natural or venue-ambient lighting (preserves environmental light character)

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**Content Restrictions:**

- **No nudity or explicit sexuality:** Iooss's Swimsuit Issue work emphasizes athletic/artistic presentation, never pornographic intent. Generated images maintain dignified subject presentation.
- **No digitally-altered body proportions:** Muscle exaggeration, unrealistic anatomy, or AI-filtered enhancement forbidden. Human forms rendered with biological authenticity.
- **No doping/injury exploitation:** Avoid imagery suggesting performance-enhancing drugs, significant injury, or medical compromise. Athletic dignity maintained.
- **No defamatory composite:** If named athlete depicted, rendering reflects known positive attributes, not fabricate damaging scenarios.

**Intellectual Property Safeguards:**

- **No Sports Illustrated logo replication:** While framework references SI as Iooss's primary patron, generated images cannot include magazine mastheads, issue dates, or watermarks identical to published works.
- **No replica of famous copyrighted photographs:** Framework teaches Iooss's *style* and *technique*, not reproduction of specific iconic images (e.g., "The Slam Dunk" Jordan image must be stylistically evoked, not pixel-matched).
- **No athlete likeness reuse without context differentiation:** If depicting named athlete, ensure context is distinct from famous published Iooss image (different sport, era, pose logic).
- **Attribution clarity:** Generated images labeled as "AI-generated in the style of Walter Iooss Jr." if used publicly.

**Validation Checklist:**

- ✓ Subject rendered with anatomically credible proportions
- ✓ No nudity or sexualized poses
- ✓ No visible Sports Illustrated logos or replicated copyright imagery
- ✓ Athlete dignity preserved (no defamatory composites)
- ✓ Historical period consistent with stated context (±2 years)
- ✓ Equipment and venue architecture era-authentic
- ✓ Lighting physically plausible
- ✓ No algorithmic artifacts (uncanny faces, impossible physics, glitch patterns)
- ✓ No modern UI overlays or digital watermarks visible

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**COMPOSITIONAL ARCHETYPES:**

**Archetype A — Peak Action Isolation (Mode 1)**
- Subject positioned off-center (rule-of-thirds intersection or dynamic tension axis)
- Athlete body occupies 40–70% frame width (landscape 16:9)
- Background blurred via shallow DOF (f/2.8–f/4.5) or distance fall-off
- Directional movement implies trajectory beyond frame edge
- Horizon line (if visible) positioned at upper or lower third, not bisecting frame

**Archetype B — Environmental Integration (Mode 3)**
- Subject and setting occupy complementary spatial zones
- Athlete positioned to interact with architectural or landscape element
- Depth-of-field moderate (f/5.6–f/8) enabling both subject and environment legibility
- Compositional balance asymmetric (subject off-center, environment anchoring opposite)
- Negative space ~20% frame

**Archetype C — Intimate Single-Subject (Mode 2)**
- Subject positioned slightly left or right of frame center (no dead-center symmetry)
- Head occupies 30–50% frame height (portrait 3:4 or 2:3)
- Shoulders/torso visible for gesture context
- Eye contact direct (engagement) or contemplative gaze (introspection)
- Background controlled, neutral, non-competing

**LIGHTING PATTERN LOGIC:**

**Pattern 1 — Dramatic Key Modeling (Dynamic Action)**
- Key light 45° horizontal, 35° elevation, unmodified or minimal diffusion
- Fill light 3:1 ratio (key to fill), visible shadow modeling
- Rim light subtle, 70° back angle, 10–15% key intensity
- Shadow floor 80–110 luminance, gradient from lit to shadow
- Effective appearance: dramatic, athletic, technically proficient

**Pattern 2 — Beauty/Studio Lighting (Intimate Portrait)**
- Key light centered on-axis, 45° elevation, softbox diffusion
- Fill light 2:1 or 2.5:1 ratio, broad reflector or secondary strobe
- Rim light 90° side/back, 10–15% key intensity, edge separation
- Shadow floor 110–140 luminance (soft shadows)
- Effective appearance: polished, intimate, psychologically accessible

**Pattern 3 — Environmental Integration Lighting (Decisive Moment)**
- Primary: ambient light (natural or venue)
- Fill strobe secondary (1.5:1 ratio, shadow detail only)
- Key light direction determined by sun/venue source (preserve natural appearance)
- Shadow floor 125–150 luminance (lighter for ambient integration)
- Effective appearance: documentary, natural-light authenticity, integrated

**LIGHTING SPECIFICATIONS (Quantified):**

**Key-to-Fill Ratio Options:**
- Action scenes: 3:1 or 4:1 (dramatic, visible modeling)
- Portraits: 2:1 or 2.5:1 (balanced, flattering)
- Environmental: 1.5:1 (soft, natural-looking)

**Shadow Floor Baseline:**
- Minimum: 25% luminance (value ≥64; action mode typical)
- Nominal: 35–50% luminance (values 90–127; portrait typical)
- Maximum: 50%+ luminance (value ≥127; environmental high-key scenarios)

**Highlight Preservation:**
- Skin tone: maximum value ≤240 (clipping prevention)
- Specular highlights: acceptable up to 250, total clipping <2% frame

**Contrast Curve Parameters:**
- Shadow lift: brighten values <50 by +10–15 points (film-era underexposure compensation)
- Midtone anchor: 128 (no shift, maintain original)
- Highlight roll-off: reduce values >200 by 5–10 points (prevent digital clipping look)

**DEPTH-OF-FIELD & FOCUS LOGIC:**

**Mode 1 (Dynamic Action):** f/2.8–f/5.6, focus on athlete's eyes or torso; background bokeh (telephoto >200mm creates compression)

**Mode 2 (Intimate Portrait):** f/2.8–f/4.0, focus critical on eyes; body/torso blur gradient

**Mode 3 (Environmental):** f/5.6–f/11, focus covers subject AND major environmental landmark

**Bokeh Pattern:** Optical (multi-bladed aperture, 7–9 blades); bokeh balls soft-edged with internal gradient (not algorithmic circular).

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Text Application Protocol:**

Iooss's archival photographs rarely include in-frame text in competition contexts. Exception: Sports Illustrated editorial imagery occasionally includes magazine logo overlays (lower-right corner, 10–20% opacity).

**Permissible Text Elements:**

- Athlete jersey numerals: Sport-specific uniform numbers legible but not compositionally dominant (rendered via uniform texture, not overlaid fonts)
- Venue signage: Background stadium/arena signage (out-of-focus, bokeh'd, recognizable but not character-sharp)
- Watermark/attribution (if used): Subtle bottom-right overlay, 5–10% opacity, sans-serif font, 8–12pt equivalent

**Forbidden Text Applications:**

- Watermarks covering subject: Logo placement must not obscure athlete face/upper torso
- Anachronistic signage: No post-2024 sponsor brands if framework context predates 2024
- Compositional text insertion: No overlaid captions, no title-card styling
- Magazine masthead exact replication: No Sports Illustrated logo identical to published versions
