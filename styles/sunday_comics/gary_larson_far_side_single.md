  # Gary Larson Single-Panel Comic Framework Integration

  ## üîß Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

  - **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1‚Üí8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
  - **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
  - **Style over likeness:** Absurdist humor via animal anthropomorphization and scientific precision
  - **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language
  - **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions
  - **Custom Flag Authorization:** Larson-specific flags permitted when standard options fail authenticity
  - **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately uncomfortable scientific humor

  **Face-Treatment Flags:**

  - `pen-crosshatch` - Primary technique for shading and texture
  - `brush-wash` - Watercolor applications for Sunday editions
  - `ink-contour-precise` - Clean line work with technical pen
  - `nervous-animated` - Characteristic wobbly line quality in character expressions

  **Pose Flags:**

  - `candid-motion` - Characters caught mid-action
  - `psychological-tension` - Uncomfortable social situations
  - `gestural-fluid` - Loose, expressive body language
  - `absurdist-stance` - Physically impossible or exaggerated positions

  **Canvas Control Flags:**

  - `strict-reframe` - Daily newspaper panel format
  - `adaptive-extend` - Sunday expanded format with decorative borders

  **Material Physics Authority:** India ink on Bristol board specifications override aesthetic preferences **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets **Text policy:** Caption text essential to humor delivery **Safety/IP:** No copyrighted characters; original animal scenarios **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Modest clothing appropriate to absurdist scenarios **Material authenticity:** Hand-drawn ink work with visible pen strokes, no digital smoothing **Composition boundaries:** Single black border frame; optional decorative Sunday border **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid overly polished digital rendering, maintain hand-drawn imperfection

  ------

  ## üìã Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

  **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **4:3 ratio** (daily panel) or **16:9 ratio** (Sunday strip) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

  Redraw in **Larson single-panel absurdist comic style** for **newspaper syndication format 1980-1995**.

  Identity via:

  - Anthropomorphized animals in mundane human situations
  - Scientific accuracy with absurdist twist
  - Nervous, slightly shaky line quality
  - Deadpan humor delivery

  **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original scenarios avoiding copyrighted elements. Use faux title "**The Peculiar Perspective**" or "**Beyond the Fence**" or "**The Absurd Observer**" instead of "The Far Side"

  **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` with `ink-contour-precise` **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` with `psychological-tension` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` for daily, `adaptive-extend` for Sunday **Style Dominance:** Scientific absurdism supersedes conventional comic aesthetics **Mode Selector:** Single-panel newspaper comic

  ------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

  **MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

  - **Daily Format:** `4:3` (horizontal newspaper panel)
  - **Sunday Format:** `16:9` (expanded horizontal with decorative border option)

  **CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

  - **Reframing Method:** Recompose-entirely for declared ratio
  - **Spatial Allocation:** Central focus with environmental context
  - **Background Treatment:** Simple watercolor washes or crosshatch texture
  - **Format Justification:** Newspaper column width optimization

  ------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

  **Influences:**

  - Scientific illustration meets vaudeville humor
  - 1950s-60s magazine cartoon tradition
  - Natural history documentation aesthetic
  - Existential anxiety rendered absurd

  **Medium/Production Method:**

  - India ink technical pen (0.3mm-0.5mm nib width) on 2-ply Bristol board
  - Pen-and-ink crosshatching for texture and depth
  - Watercolor washes for Sunday color editions
  - White correction fluid for highlights and corrections

  **Thematic Purpose:** Extract comedy from tragedy through animal perspective on human absurdity

  **Hallmark Motifs (quantified):**

  1. **Anthropomorphic animals** - 70% of panels feature animals in human scenarios
  2. **Scientific terminology** - Precise biological/geological vocabulary integration
  3. **Desert/prehistoric settings** - 40% feature arid landscapes or dinosaur eras
  4. **Existential scenarios** - Death, predation, cosmic insignificance as punchlines
  5. **Caption-dependent humor** - 90% require text for comedic completion

  **Period Framing:** American newspaper syndication 1980-1995, transitioning to digital tablet 2020+

  **Tone Tag:** Darkly absurdist, scientifically literate, generationally cynical

  ------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

  **Line Quality:**

  - **Primary tool:** Technical pen 0.3mm-0.5mm producing consistent 1-point line weight
  - **Nervous quality:** Intentional slight wavering in longer lines (2-3mm deviation per 10cm)
  - **Crosshatch density:** 1-2mm spacing for mid-tones, 0.5-1mm for shadows
  - **Contour precision:** Clean outer edges with minimal correction marks visible

  **Color Application (Sunday editions):**

  - **Watercolor transparency:** 20-40% opacity for background washes
  - **Limited palette:** Earth tones (ochre, sienna, sage) + primary spot colors
  - **Wet-on-dry technique:** No color bleeding, distinct edges between washes
  - **White paper retention:** 30-40% of panel remains unpainted

  **Texture Methods:**

  - **Stippling density:** 8-12 dots per square centimeter for skin textures
  - **Parallel hatching:** 45-degree angle, 1-2mm line spacing
  - **Cross-hatching:** Secondary layer at 90-degree offset for deepest shadows
  - **Brush texture:** Visible individual bristle marks in watercolor areas

  **Pose Anchors:**

  - **Animal anatomy accuracy:** Skeletal structure correct beneath anthropomorphic clothing
  - **Human gesture mapping:** Recognizable human body language translated to animal proportions
  - **Expression economy:** 3-5 facial features convey complex psychological states
  - **Physical comedy:** Exaggerated proportions up to 150% for comedic effect

  **Scale Hierarchy:**

  - **Figure dominance:** Characters occupy 40-60% of panel space
  - **Environmental detail:** Background elements 20-30% smaller than foreground
  - **Text integration:** Caption box 15-20% of total panel height

  **Material Authenticity:**

  - Visible pen pressure variation in line weight
  - Watercolor paper texture evident in unpainted areas
  - India ink matte finish, no digital sheen
  - Hand-lettered caption text with slight irregularity

  **Period Consistency:**

  - 1980s-90s newspaper reproduction limitations
  - Halftone dot pattern in color separations
  - Registration drift ¬±0.5mm in color alignment
  - Newsprint paper absorption creating soft edges

  ------
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

  **Wardrobe Tracks:**

  - **Animal-as-human:** Business casual, scientific lab coats, generic contemporary clothing
  - **Human characters:** 1950s-80s American suburban/rural aesthetic
  - **Period accuracy:** Avoid contemporary fashion post-1995

  **Fabric Behavior:**

  - **Cartoon simplification:** Minimal folds, 2-3 lines suggest draping
  - **Pattern economy:** Stripes, polka dots, simple geometric patterns only
  - **Color limitation:** Solid colors or simple two-tone combinations

  **Accessory Caps:**

  - **Minimalist:** 1-2 props maximum per panel
  - **Scientific equipment:** Beakers, microscopes, field guides rendered accurately
  - **Everyday objects:** Telephones, chairs, simple household items

  **Color Palette:**

  - **Earth tones dominant:** Browns, tans, muted greens
  - **Accent colors:** Limited bright spots for focal points
  - **Historical dye limitations:** Colors achievable with 1980s newspaper printing

  **Wardrobe Variation:**

  - Cycle through period-appropriate casual/professional mix
  - Avoid identical costumes between iterations

  **Props (YAML pool):**

  ```yaml

    - window_frame
  nature_elements:
    - cactus
    - rock_formation
    - simple_tree
    - grass_tuft
  ```

  **Coherence Filter:** All elements support absurdist scientific scenarios; fallback = minimal environment
