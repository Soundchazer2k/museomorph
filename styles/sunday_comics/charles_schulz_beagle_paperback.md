  Charles M. Schulz paired round-headed kids, misregistered CMYK, and
  halftone-rosette skies to bottle gentle melancholy. This Sunday card keeps the
  1960s print physics—pulp tooth, ±1mm drift—while inventing a new Beagle crew
  with their own bittersweet jokes.

- ## Charles M. Schulz - 1950s-1970s Comic Strip Collection Aesthetic

  ------

  ## 🔧 Renderer-Agnostic Adapter (Schulz-Specific)

  - **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
  - **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared 2:3 aspect ratio.
  - **Style over likeness:** Likeness via simplified geometric silhouette and minimalist line economy.
  - **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("1.5-2mm pen lines", "65-85 LPI halftone", "±0.5-1mm registration drift") override descriptive language.
  - **Process-Over-Result Priority:** India ink application with Esterbrook 914 radio pen and 1960s offset printing supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
  - **Custom Flag Authorization:** Schulz-specific technical flags permitted for authentic reproduction.
  - **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately sparse, melancholic aesthetics when historically accurate.
  - **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` with mechanical consistency, dot eyes 3mm diameter, curved line mouths 8-12mm wide
  - **Pose Flag:** `frontal-rigid` with bilateral symmetry, minimal perspective distortion
  - **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` for 2:3 vertical emphasis
  - **Media Hybrid Flag:** Not applicable - pure pen-and-ink illustration
  - **Material Physics Authority:** Strathmore 3-ply paper, India ink, Esterbrook 914 radio pen (drawing), Speedball C-5 pen (lettering) specifications override aesthetic preferences.
  - **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Newsprint reproduction requires simplified detail hierarchy and high-contrast line work.
  - **Cultural Production Authenticity:** 1960s-1970s American mass-market paperback methods take precedence over modern printing.
  - **Quantifiers authoritative:** All numeric specifications (line weights, halftone frequencies, registration tolerances) are binding targets.
  - **Text policy:** Always allow text for cover format - hand-lettered titles essential.
  - **Safety/IP:** No Peanuts characters, names, or copyrighted elements; create original "Beagle" universe characters.
  - **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Characters are children - simple, modest clothing appropriate to 1950s-1970s suburban youth.
  - **Gender expression:** Simple, non-gendered children's clothing variations.
  - **Material authenticity:** No digital smoothing, vector conversion, or modern gradient effects - authentic halftone dot structure required.
  - **Period Production Authenticity:** 1960s-1970s offset printing limitations (visible dots, registration drift, ink spread) are mandatory, not optional.
  - **Composition boundaries:** No decorative frames - cover bleeds to trim edges.
  - **Failure Mode Flags:**
    - Avoid: anime autopilot, digital vector smoothness, modern printing perfection, gradient shading, complex linework variation
    - Require: mechanical line consistency, visible halftone structure, period printing artifacts, simplified geometric forms
  - **Silent validation:** Apply Schulz technique checklist (round heads, zigzag stripes, minimalist features, flat composition, hand-lettered text); regenerate silently if fail.

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

  **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.

  Redraw as vintage 1950s-1970s **Beagle** book cover for **mass-market paperback publication format**.

  Identity via simplified geometric silhouette and gestural line economy.

  **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original character designs avoiding copyrighted Peanuts iconography - create distinct round-headed children and anthropomorphic dog characters with unique visual identities separate from Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, and all Peanuts characters.

  **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` with clean 1-2mm ink lines
   **Pose Flag:** `frontal-rigid` with minimal perspective distortion
   **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
   **Style Dominance:** Period-authentic offset printing aesthetics override modern digital clarity

  **Mode Selector:** Cover mode - vintage paperback book design

  ------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

  **MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (standard paperback/poster format)

  **CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

  - **Reframing Method:** recompose-entirely for vertical cover emphasis
  - **Spatial Allocation:** Central character placement with 70% figure dominance
  - **Background Treatment:** Solid color fields (60-80% coverage) with minimal environmental detail
  - **Format Justification:** 2:3 ratio maximizes shelf visibility and vintage paperback authenticity
