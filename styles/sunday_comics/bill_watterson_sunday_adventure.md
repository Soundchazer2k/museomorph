  # Bill Watterson Style - Pepper & Thunder Framework

  ## 🔧 Artist-Specific Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

  **Constraint precedence:** Emotional authenticity over commercial polish; expressive brushwork supersedes technical precision
   **Face-Treatment Flag:** `brush-loaded-single-stroke` with `watercolor-soft` atmospheric integration
   **Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid` with childlike energy and philosophical depth
   **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` for naturalistic environment requirements
   **Material Physics Authority:** Sable brush #3 with India ink on Bristol board, watercolor wash backgrounds, authentic brush bloom preservation
   **Cultural/Period Authenticity:** 1985-1995 newspaper comic strip production, hand-lettered typography, period offset printing characteristics
   **Expressive Philosophy:** Line economy serving emotional truth, backgrounds as atmospheric mood support, philosophical depth through innocent perspective
   **Technical Specifications:** 1.5-2mm primary strokes, 0.3-0.5mm detail lines, crowquill pen backgrounds, authentic paper-ink interaction
   **Sunday Format Innovation:** Half-page canvas freedom establishing artistic potential of comic strip medium, experimental panel layouts
   **IP Protection:** Original boy-and-companion character designs avoiding Calvin/Hobbes iconography, distinct costume elements, alternative color schemes
   **Safety Guardrails:** Age-appropriate content, modest attire for child characters, no copyrighted logos/signatures

  > **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = modest age-appropriate attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

  ## 📋 Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

  **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **16:9 ratio** (Sunday strip half-page format) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

  **Gender Preservation Mandate:** MAINTAIN the subject's presented gender identity throughout transformation. Adapt character design, clothing, and styling to match subject while avoiding Calvin/Hobbes iconography.

  **IP Safeguard:** Create original child-and-companion characters with completely distinct designs:

  - **Gender Preservation:** Maintain subject's presented gender identity
  - **Hair style variation** (curly brown, messy black, short cropped, long flowing - NOT Calvin's spiky blonde)
  - **Companion species change** (spotted leopard, raccoon, fox, dog - NOT striped tiger)
  - **Clothing patterns** (blue/orange stripes, green/yellow, solid colors - NOT red/black)
  - **NO Calvin iconography, NO Hobbes design elements**

  **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **kinetic gesture/wide-eyed wonder/mischievous expression** adapted to subject's age and gender presentation; integrate into **expressive comic medium** emphasizing **emotional authenticity** and **philosophical depth**.

  **Face-Treatment Flag:** `brush-loaded-single-stroke`
   **Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid`
   **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend`
   **Style Dominance:** Watterson's expressive brushwork and emotional honesty supersedes technical perfection, prioritizing **childhood wonder** and **philosophical insight**.
   **Mode Selector:** Sunday Comic Strip Cover/Treasury Collection

  ------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

  **MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

  - **16:9** (Sunday strip half-page - primary choice)
  - **3:4** (treasury collection cover alternative)
  - **4:3** (landscape book cover variation)

  **CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

  - **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with naturalistic environment integration
  - **Spatial Allocation:** Characters 40-60%, naturalistic background 30-50%, atmospheric breathing room 20-30%, philosophical text integration 10-15%
  - **Background Treatment:** Watercolor-style environments (woodland scenes, snowy landscapes, suburban backyards) supporting emotional atmosphere
  - **Format Justification:** Sunday strip format serves horizontal storytelling flow with environmental context and philosophical reflection integration

  ------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

  **Influences:** Charles Schulz (emotional depth), George Herriman (Sunday page experimentation), Walt Kelly (social commentary), Windsor McCay (imaginative layouts)

  **Medium/Production method:** Sable brush #3 with India ink on Bristol board, crowquill pen for backgrounds, watercolor wash atmospheric effects, single confident brush strokes with natural variation

  **Thematic purpose:** Childhood imagination versus adult reality exploration, philosophical musings through innocent perspective, social satire via six-year-old observations

  **Hallmark motifs:**

  - **1.5-2mm confident brush strokes** with natural thick-to-thin variation and authentic blooms
  - **150% eye enlargement** beyond standard cartoon proportion with 2 o'clock white highlights
  - **20-30 individual grass blade strokes** per clump with 8-12 tree bark texture lines per trunk
  - **30% solid black panel coverage** for dramatic contrast with 1mm feathering edges
  - **200-250% limb extension** during action sequences with 180-degree jaw drops for surprise

  **Period framing:** American newspaper syndication 1985-1995, specifically Sunday half-page format innovations post-1992

  **Tone Tag:** Whimsical-philosophical with energetic contemplation
