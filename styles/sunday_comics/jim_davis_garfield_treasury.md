  # Jim Davis Garfield Style - Universal Humor Framework

  ## 🔧 Artist-Specific Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

  **Constraint precedence:** Commercial clarity over artistic complexity; universal appeal supersedes niche references
   **Face-Treatment Flag:** `clean-bold-outline` with `expressive-simple` characteristics
   **Pose Flag:** `domestic-relatable` with minimal movement and maximum expression
   **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` for character showcase priority
   **Material Physics Authority:** Clean ink lines on Bristol board, flat color application, commercial reproduction optimization
   **Cultural/Period Authenticity:** 1978-present newspaper comic strip production, merchandising-optimized design, universal appeal methodology
   **Commercial Philosophy:** Apolitical humor, timeless domestic situations, "human in a cat suit" relatability
   **Technical Specifications:** 2-3mm consistent outline weight, minimal crosshatching, flat color zones, expression-focused design
   **Universal Appeal Innovation:** Market-tested character archetypes, conflict-based humor formula, global merchandising potential
   **IP Protection:** Original lazy pet character designs avoiding Garfield iconography, distinct personality combinations
   **Safety Guardrails:** Age-appropriate content, modest attire, no copyrighted logos/signatures, universal family-friendly humor

  > **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = modest age-appropriate attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

  ## 📋 Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

  **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (book cover portrait format) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

  **Redraw command:** "Redraw in **Jim Davis's clean commercial line technique** for **exact Garfield book collection cover format**."

  **Gender Preservation Mandate:** MAINTAIN the subject's presented gender identity throughout transformation. Adapt character design to match subject while creating commercially viable personality archetype.

  **IP Safeguard:** Create original pet-and-owner characters with completely distinct designs:

  - **Pet variations:** Lazy dog, cynical rabbit, apathetic hamster, sardonic parrot (NOT orange cat)
  - **Owner personality:** Perpetual optimist, struggling professional, hopeless romantic (maintain relatability)
  - **Color schemes:** Blue/gray, brown/tan, green/cream, purple/white (NOT orange/black)
  - **NO Garfield iconography, NO Jon/Odie design elements**

  **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **simple expressive face/relatable pose/universal gesture**; integrate into **commercial comic medium** emphasizing **clarity** and **mass appeal**.

  **Face-Treatment Flag:** `clean-bold-outline`
   **Pose Flag:** `domestic-relatable`
   **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
   **Style Dominance:** Davis's commercial clarity and universal appeal supersedes artistic experimentation, prioritizing **readability** and **merchandising potential**.
   **Mode Selector:** Newspaper Comic Strip / Book Collection Cover

  ------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

  **MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

  - **2:3** (book cover portrait - primary choice)
  - **3:4** (treasury collection alternative)
  - **4:5** (modern poster variation)

  **CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

  - **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with single iconic character moment priority
  - **Spatial Allocation:** Characters 65-75%, simple domestic setting 15-25%, typography zones 10-15%, negative space for title placement
  - **Background Treatment:** Minimal environmental detail supporting character showcase and visual gag
  - **Format Justification:** Book cover format serves single iconic character moment with maximum personality expression and merchandising appeal

  ------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

  **Influences:** Charles Schulz (character warmth), Walt Disney (appealing design), advertising illustration (commercial clarity), theatrical staging (setup-punchline structure)

  **Medium/Production method:** Clean ink lines on Bristol board, flat color application for reproduction, minimal shading, commercial printing optimization

  **Thematic purpose:** Universal domestic humor through lazy pet archetype, apolitical relatability, timeless creature comfort situations

  **Hallmark motifs:**

  - **2-3mm consistent bold outline** with clean corners and smooth curves
  - **Large expressive eyes** (50% of head height) with half-lidded cynical expression for main character
  - **Single iconic pose** capturing complete personality (lounging, eating, sleeping, smirking)
  - **Flat color application** with 3-5 color maximum per composition for reproduction clarity
  - **Expression-driven personality** conveyed through single frozen moment rather than sequential action

  **Period framing:** American newspaper syndication 1978-present, global merchandising empire 1981-present

  **Tone Tag:** Cynically-relatable with commercial appeal

  ------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

  **Line Quality with Commercial Clarity:**

  - Bold outline: 2-3mm consistent weight throughout
  - Interior details: 1mm thin lines for minimal features only
  - No crosshatching or texture rendering
  - Clean corners with 90-degree angles where appropriate
  - Smooth curves avoiding hand-drawn wobble

  **Expression System (Universal Appeal):**

  - Eyes: 50% of head height, simple oval or half-circle shapes
  - Pupils: Dot placement for direction (looking at food, away from work, toward comfort)
  - Mouth: Simple curve (smile, frown, smirk) with minimal tooth indication
  - Eyebrows: Heavy black shapes for maximum emotion clarity
  - Body language: Minimal - 80% emotion through face alone

  **Character Design Anchors:**

  - **Main character (lazy pet):** Round body, stubby limbs, single iconic pose capturing personality essence
  - **Straight man (owner):** Simple human proportions, characteristic expression frozen in relatable moment
  - **Cover composition:** Single visual moment telling complete personality story without sequential context

  **Background Minimalism:**

  - 5-10 simple shapes maximum per panel
  - Flat color zones with no gradients
  - Furniture/props reduced to essential identifying features
  - 70% negative space allowing character focus

  **Color Application:**

  - 3-5 flat colors maximum per composition
  - No shading or gradients - pure flat zones
  - High contrast for reproduction clarity
  - Limited palette for merchandising consistency

  **Commercial Optimization Anchors:**

  - Clean silhouettes readable at thumbnail size
  - Single personality-defining pose (lounging, eating, smirking, sleeping)
  - Merchandising-friendly character presentation
  - Iconic moment staging (pet with food, owner frustrated, visual gag frozen in time)

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

  - **Minimal clothing:** None or single accessory (collar, bow, hat)
  - **Color scheme:** Single dominant color with simple pattern option

  **HUMAN CHARACTER (Owner - Adapt to Subject):**

  **For Male Characters (like Jon):**

  - **Color palette:** Muted tones (blues, greens, browns, grays)
