  Berkeley Breathed stuffed penguins, politics, and airbrushed rainbows into
  freewheeling Sunday layouts. His ink lines wobble with manic energy, yet every
  spread can double as a kid-lit parody. We channel that anarchic whimsy with
  new critters, headlines, and power-ballad color palettes.

  # Berkeley Breathed Bloom County Style - Satirical Whimsy Framework

  ## 🔧 Artist-Specific Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

  **Constraint precedence:** Satirical commentary over technical perfection; meta-humor authority supersedes traditional comic conventions
   **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` with `nervous-animated` characteristics for comic strips OR `gouache-opaque` with `airbrushed-soft` for children's book style
   **Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid` with Chuck Jones "squash-and-stretch" exaggeration
   **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` for book cover compositions
   **Material Physics Authority:** Pen and ink on Bristol board for comics, airbrushed gouache for book illustrations
   **Cultural/Period Authenticity:** 1980s political satire methods, MTV-era visual language, Pulitzer-winning editorial cartooning standards
   **Satirical Philosophy:** Direct mockery of real celebrities/brands, meta-humor breaking fourth wall, surreal whimsy serving political critique
   **Technical Specifications:** Variable line weight 0.5-3mm, exaggerated expressions, wild camera angles, fake advertisement integration
   **Chuck Jones Innovation:** "Squash-and-stretch" animation principles establishing dynamic comic aesthetics, extreme physical comedy
   **IP Protection:** Original satirical character designs avoiding Opus/Bill the Cat iconography, distinct personality archetypes
   **Safety Guardrails:** Age-appropriate content, modest attire, no copyrighted logos/signatures, satirical artistic standards

  > **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = modest age-appropriate attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.

  ------

  ## 📋 Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

  **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (book cover portrait format) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

  **Redraw command:** "Redraw in **Berkeley Breathed's satirical whimsy technique** for **exact Bloom County collection cover format**."

  **Gender Preservation Mandate:** MAINTAIN the subject's presented gender identity throughout transformation. Adapt character design to match subject while creating satirically viable personality archetype.

  **IP Safeguard:** Create original satirical ensemble characters with completely distinct designs:

  - **Innocent character:** Different species from penguin (puffin, duck, rabbit, seal) as emotional center
  - **Straight man:** Everyman character avoiding exact human archetypes from Bloom County
  - **Wild card:** Absurd element (different from Bill the Cat) for chaos injection
  - **Color schemes:** Vary from Bloom County palette while maintaining satirical clarity
  - **NO Opus iconography, NO Bill the Cat designs, NO Steve Dallas elements**

  **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **exaggerated expression/satirical gesture/whimsical interaction**; integrate into **political satire comic medium** emphasizing **meta-humor** and **cultural critique**.

  **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` (for comic strips) OR `gouache-opaque` (for children's book covers)
   **Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid` with animation exaggeration
   **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
   **Style Dominance:** Breathed's satirical energy and Chuck Jones dynamics supersede realistic representation, prioritizing **political commentary** and **surreal humor**.
   **Mode Selector:** Satirical Book Cover Collection / Children's Book Illustration

  ------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

  **MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

  - **2:3** (book cover portrait - primary choice for comic collections)
  - **3:4** (treasury alternative)
  - **1:1** (square format for children's books)

  **CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

  - **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with satirical moment and character interaction priority
  - **Spatial Allocation:** Characters 65-75%, surreal/satirical elements 15-25%, typography zones 10-15%
  - **Background Treatment:** Meta-humor elements (fake ads, wild angles) or whimsical environments supporting satire
  - **Format Justification:** Book cover format serves single satirical moment with maximum political/social commentary impact

  ------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

  **Influences:** Chuck Jones (animation dynamics), Garry Trudeau (political satire), MTV visual culture, editorial cartooning tradition, Chris Van Allsburg (children's book airbrushing)

  **Medium/Production method:**

  - **Comic style:** Pen and ink on Bristol board, variable line weight, crosshatching for depth, fake advertisement collage
  - **Children's book style:** Airbrushed gouache, lush color gradients, painterly soft edges

  **Thematic purpose:** Political/social satire through innocent animal characters, surreal whimsy serving editorial commentary, meta-humor breaking fourth wall

  **Hallmark motifs:**

  - **Exaggerated expressions** with Chuck Jones "squash-and-stretch" principles (eyes 200% normal size during surprise)
  - **Wild camera angles** (worm's eye, bird's eye, Dutch angles) in 60% of compositions
  - **Meta-humor elements** (fake ads, altered photos, fourth-wall breaking) integrated 40% of time
  - **Variable line weight** 0.5-3mm serving emotional emphasis
  - **Innocent-amidst-insane** dynamic - naive character reacting to absurd situations

  **Period framing:** American political satire 1980-1989 (Bloom County era), 1989-1995 (Outland era), children's literature 1995-present

  **Tone Tag:** Satirically-whimsical with political edge

  ------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

  **Line Quality with Satirical Energy (Comic Style):**

  - Variable weight: 0.5mm detail lines to 3mm bold outlines
  - Nervous, energetic pen strokes with emotional authenticity
  - Crosshatching: 15-25 lines per inch in shadow areas, directional variation for energy
  - Chuck Jones influence: fluid, confident strokes suggesting movement
  - Pen blooms and organic line variation preserved for authenticity

  **Chuck Jones Animation Principles:**

  - "Squash-and-stretch" exaggeration: 200-300% eye enlargement during surprise
  - Extreme poses: 45-90 degree body angles during reaction shots
  - Anticipation frames: character coiled before action
  - Follow-through: limbs extending 150% beyond natural reach
  - Smear frames: motion blur indicating speed

  **Expression System (Satirical Commentary):**

  - Eyes: Variable size based on emotion (50-200% range)
  - Mouths: Extreme shapes (perfect circles for shock, zigzag for frustration)
  - Body language: Full-body expressions using animation principles
  - Eyebrows: Heavy black shapes at impossible angles
  - Sweat drops, motion lines, impact stars for emphasis

  **Meta-Humor Integration:**

  - Fake advertisement space: 10-20% composition allocated
  - Fourth-wall breaking: character awareness of being in comic
  - Wild camera angles: 45-degree Dutch angles, extreme perspectives
  - Collage elements: cut-out photos, altered images, mixed media

  **Children's Book Style (Alternative):**

  - Airbrushed gouache: Soft gradients with 5-10 value transitions
  - Lush color depth: 60-80% saturation levels
  - Painterly edges: Soft blending replacing hard ink lines
  - Depth illusion: Atmospheric perspective with color temperature shifts

  **Pose Anchors:**

  - Head tilt: 30-60 degrees for reaction emphasis
  - Shoulder-hip differential: 45-90 degrees for dynamic energy
  - Weight distribution: Extreme imbalance (80/20, 90/10) for comedy
  - Gesture economy: Exaggerated pointing, dramatic recoiling

  **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 2:3 book cover format with satirical moment showcase and political commentary integration
