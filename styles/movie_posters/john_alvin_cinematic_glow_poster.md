# John Alvin

**Version:** 1.0
 **Purpose:** Authentic reproduction of John Alvin's "Alvinesque" cinematic poster illustration technique based on visual evidence analysis of 10 canonical examples (1974-2008 period). Enforces his signature symbolic minimalism, "thick light" atmospheric effects, and analog mixed-media process.

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always compose for `2:3` aspect ratio (standard movie poster format) - ignore source image dimensions.
- **Style over complexity:** Single powerful symbolic concept over character montages or busy compositions.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("6-inch airbrush distance", "80% atmospheric coverage", "15-degree light beam angles") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Analog mixed-media sequence (illustration board → pencil → airbrush acrylic → frisket masking → colored pencil details) supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Alvin-Specific Flags (choose one Face-Treatment):**
  - *Core Technique:* `airbrush-thick-light`, `frisket-hard-edges`, `symbolic-minimalism`, `mystical-atmosphere`
  - *Character Rendering:* `silhouette-emphasis`, `rim-backlighting`, `emotional-gesture`, `minimal-facial-detail`
  - *Background Treatment:* `volumetric-lighting`, `atmospheric-gradients`, `single-concept-focus`, `analog-texture-preservation`
- **Pose Flags:** `contemplative-silhouette`, `symbolic-gesture`, `romantic-embrace`, `mystical-reaching`, `vulnerable-isolation`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (always 2:3 movie poster format)
- **Production Authenticity:** 1980s-1990s analog illustration techniques with visible mixed-media characteristics
- **Material Physics Authority:** Airbrush smoothness, frisket masking precision, illustration board texture
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Theater lobby viewing distance affects atmospheric detail and symbolic clarity
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** All numeric specifications are exact targets
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes with period-appropriate movie poster typography
- **Safety/IP:** No real actor likenesses; original symbolic character designs
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** All characters adult presentation; timeless costume design
- **Material authenticity:** Authentic airbrush gradients with analog mixed-media layering - no digital smoothing or modern post-processing
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Pre-digital poster era with characteristic analog illustration imperfections and registration tolerance
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; integrate typography organically into atmospheric lighting
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid digital painting smoothness, avoid photographic realism, avoid character montage complexity

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (movie poster format) - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **John Alvin symbolic poster illustration style** for **theatrical one-sheet poster**.
- Identity via symbolic gesture, atmospheric mood, and emotional resonance rather than facial detail.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original symbolic character designs avoiding real actor likenesses and trademarked elements.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `airbrush-thick-light`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `contemplative-silhouette`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Analog mixed-media illustration technique over digital or photographic approaches.
- **Mode Selector:** Symbolic poster (single powerful concept with mystical atmosphere).

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (theatrical movie poster standard)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Extend atmospheric background to fill vertical poster format while preserving central symbolic image
- **Spatial Allocation:**
  - Central symbolic element: 40-60% of canvas area, positioned in golden ratio intersection
  - Atmospheric background: 60-80% coverage with volumetric lighting effects
  - Typography zone: Lower 20% with organic integration into atmospheric lighting
  - Negative space: 30-40% to emphasize symbolic clarity
- **Background Treatment:** Seamless airbrush gradient transition from mystical light source to deep atmospheric colors
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 ratio optimizes symbolic impact and atmospheric depth for theater lobby viewing distance

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** N.C. Wyeth narrative illustration, Renaissance chiaroscuro, Spielberg cinematic lighting, classical symbolism
- **Medium/Production method:** Mixed-media on illustration board - pencil foundation, airbrush acrylics, frisket masking, colored pencil details, pastel accents
- **Thematic purpose:** Create "promise of great experience" through mystical atmosphere and emotional symbolism
- **5 hallmark motifs with quantifications:**
  1. **"Thick Light" volumetric effects:** 60-80% atmospheric coverage with visible light beams at 15-30 degree angles
  2. **Single symbolic concept:** One powerful central image occupying 40-60% canvas area with metaphorical meaning
  3. **Silhouette emphasis:** Character forms defined by rim lighting with 80-90% backlighting coverage
  4. **Mystical atmosphere:** Unexplained light sources creating 70-80% warm/cool color temperature contrast
  5. **Minimal facial detail:** Character identity through gesture and silhouette rather than photographic portraiture
- **Period framing:** Golden age of analog movie poster illustration (1970s-1990s) before digital dominance
- **Tone Tag:** Mystical wonder, emotional resonance, symbolic promise
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Hand-painted analog techniques with characteristic airbrush smoothness and frisket precision

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Illustration Board Foundation Anchor:** 30x40 inch rigid multi-ply paper board providing smooth airbrush surface
- **Airbrush Distance Anchor:** 6-inch spray distance for soft atmospheric gradients, 2-inch distance for fine detail work
- **Frisket Masking Anchor:** Self-adhering plastic film creating sharp 90-degree edge transitions between atmospheric and detailed areas
- **Thick Light Technique Anchor:** Overlapping airbrush passes building volumetric light effects with 70-80% atmospheric density
- **Back-to-Front Painting Anchor:** Background atmospheric elements painted first, foreground details masked and added sequentially
- **Symbolic Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Central symbolic element 40-60% larger than supporting elements, positioned in golden ratio
- **Warm/Cool Temperature Anchor:** 70-80% color temperature contrast between warm light sources and cool atmospheric backgrounds
- **Analog Texture Preservation Anchor:** Visible mixed-media characteristics including airbrush overspray patterns and paper board texture
- **Light Beam Geometry Anchor:** Volumetric light rays at 15-30 degree angles creating mystical atmosphere with measurable perspective
- **Character Rim Lighting Anchor:** 80-90% backlighting coverage defining silhouettes with 2-3mm highlight edges

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks:** Timeless symbolic costume design (adult presentation)

- **Fabric behavior:** Flowing materials that catch rim lighting effectively - silk, cotton, leather with natural drape
- **Color palette restrictions:** Muted earth tones, deep blues, warm golds - colors that respond well to atmospheric lighting
- **Wardrobe variation required:** Cycle through symbolic archetypes - hero, mentor, innocent, mysterious figure
- **Props:** 1-2 symbolic objects maximum with metaphorical significance to story theme
- **Coherence filter:** All elements support mystical atmosphere and symbolic meaning; fallback = simple silhouette

**GENRE-SPECIFIC PROP POOLS:**

```yaml
