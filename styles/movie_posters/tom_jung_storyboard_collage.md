# Tom Jung

**Version:** 4.2
 **Purpose:** Authentic reproduction of Tom Jung's 1970s-80s commercial movie poster aesthetic with genre-specific constraints and photo-offset lithography production authenticity.

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Realistic actor portrayal enhanced through dramatic lighting and atmospheric composition.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("45% character focus", "3-5mm offset ink film") override descriptive language ("heroic", "thick paint").
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Photo-offset lithography production methods supersede digital perfection.
- **Genre Commercial Authority:** Marketing function requirements override pure artistic preferences.
- **Anti-Modern Bias:** Authority to reject contemporary digital effects or photorealistic rendering.

**Face-Treatment Flags (mandatory selection):**

- `painterly-contour`: Illustrative brushwork visible, not photographic
- `realistic-actor-portrayal`: Normal human proportions with dramatic lighting
- `commercial-appeal`: Teen/young adult demographic targeting
- `offset-lithography-artifacts`: Subtle film grain, elevated black levels

**Pose Flags (mandatory selection):**

- `dynamic-diagonal`: Dramatic diagonal positioning for visual energy
- `protective-stance`: Secondary figure supportive positioning
- `atmospheric-integration`: Background elements seamlessly blended

**Canvas Control Flags (mandatory selection):**

- `strict-reframe`: Exact 27"x41" (2:3) portrait ratio enforcement
- `balanced-composition`: 45% character, 35% atmosphere, 20% negative space

**Production Authenticity Flags (mandatory selection):**

- `photo-offset-lithography`: Flat multicolor plates, no CMYK rosettes
- `uncoated-paper-stock`: Matte finish, ink absorption artifacts
- `1970s-80s-commercial`: Period-appropriate marketing constraints

**Material Physics Authority:** Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences. **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Viewing distance requirements affect brushwork precision and detail hierarchy. **Cultural Production Authenticity:** Indigenous and traditional methods take precedence over modern interpretations. **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are targets. **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes. **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures. **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral. **Gender expression:** Respect presented. **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics. **Period Production Authenticity:** For historical publication styles (comics, magazines, prints), use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection. **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits. **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid genre drift defaults (anime autopilot, HDR smoothing, etc.). **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio (movie poster standard)** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Tom Jung's 1970s-80s Commercial Movie Poster Style** for **27"x41" theatrical one-sheet format**.
- Identity via dramatic actor portrayal, atmospheric composition, realistic human proportions.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original character designs avoiding copyrighted costume elements, logos, or trademarked symbols.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `painterly-contour` + `realistic-actor-portrayal`
- **Pose Flag:** `dynamic-diagonal`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Production Flag:** `photo-offset-lithography`
- **Style Dominance:** Commercial poster illustration with realistic human figures.
- **Mode Selector:** Theatrical movie poster.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (27"x41" theatrical one-sheet)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Extend atmospheric background elements to fill exact 2:3 ratio
- **Spatial Allocation:** Primary characters 45% canvas focus, positioned for optimal visual impact
- **Background Treatment:** Atmospheric elements (space, landscapes, symbolic imagery) seamlessly integrated
- **Format Justification:** Portrait orientation maximizes character impact and hierarchical title placement

**JUNG-SPECIFIC SPATIAL LOGIC:**

- Primary character focus: 45% visual weight (realistic actor proportions)
- Atmospheric background: 35% canvas allocation for genre context and mood
- Negative space: 20% providing visual breathing room and title space
- Diagonal emphasis: 45-60 degree dynamic angles for visual energy

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** 1970s-80s commercial poster photography, dramatic Hollywood marketing aesthetics, studio system star presentation
- **Medium/Production method:** Original gouache/acrylic painting reproduced via photo-offset lithography on uncoated paper stock with characteristic ink absorption and subtle film grain artifacts
- **Thematic purpose:** Commercial movie marketing through dramatic character presentation and genre-appropriate atmospheric storytelling
- **Hallmark motifs with specifications:**
  1. **Realistic dramatic presentation:** Normal human proportions enhanced through dynamic lighting and atmospheric composition
  2. **Atmospheric symbolic backgrounds:** Genre elements (space, landscapes, villain imagery) integrated symbolically
  3. **Dynamic action positioning:** Diagonal poses at 45-60 degree angles creating visual energy with realistic anatomy
  4. **Genre-specific color relationships:** Science fantasy (blue/orange), adventure (earth/gold), war (muted/red accents), drama (warm/romantic)
  5. **Commercial poster hierarchy:** Clear visual flow optimized for theater marketing and audience appeal
- **Period framing:** Late 1970s through 1980s theatrical marketing peak
- **Tone Tag:** Dramatic, commercially appealing to teen/young adult demographics
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Photo-offset lithography limitations, flat multicolor separation, uncoated paper absorption characteristics

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**ILLUSTRATED/PAINTED ANCHORS:**

- **Line quality:** Visible brushwork marks, 2-3mm stroke width, confident directional application
- **Color mixing:** Flat multicolor separation plates, no CMYK rosette patterns, solid color planes
- **Texture specifications:** 3-5mm ink film thickness simulation, matte paper absorption effects
- **Edge treatment:** Crisp costume edges, atmospheric background blending, no digital anti-aliasing
- **Stroke economy:** Confident mark-making, minimal overworking, commercial deadline efficiency
- **Surface depth:** Subtle film grain texture from photo-lithography process, elevated black levels from ink absorption

**POSE TECHNICAL ANCHORS:**

- **Head tilt:** 15-25 degrees for dynamic energy, never static frontal
- **Shoulder-hip differential:** 20-30 degree contrapposto for dynamic stance
- **Weight distribution:** 70% on rear leg for action positioning
- **Gesture specificity:** Weapon/tool positioning at 45-60 degree angles for visual impact

**SCALE HIERARCHY ANCHOR:** Primary characters maintaining realistic actor proportions with dramatic lighting enhancement, secondary figures 30-35% relative scale, atmospheric elements providing symbolic presence

**MATERIAL AUTHENTICITY ANCHOR:** Photo-offset lithography characteristics - flat color separations, subtle hickey artifacts, paper texture interaction, no modern digital perfection

**PERIOD CONSISTENCY ANCHOR:** 1970s-80s commercial poster production methods, marketing demographic targeting, studio system aesthetic requirements

**CANVAS ADAPTATION ANCHOR:** Composition specifically designed for 2:3 theatrical poster format with genre-appropriate visual hierarchy
