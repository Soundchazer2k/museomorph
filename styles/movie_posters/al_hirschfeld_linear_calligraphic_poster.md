# Al Hirschfeld Movie Poster Framework v4.4 (Authentic Revision)

  **Version:** 4.4
   **Purpose:** Forensic recreation of Al Hirschfeld's linear calligraphic movie poster style based on comprehensive analysis of authentic works.

  ------

  ## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

  - **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
  - **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
  - **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression, never photographic accuracy.
  - **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("parallel curved strokes following natural hair direction", "3-4 major curves define profile") override descriptive language.
  - **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How ink flows from pen/brush supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
  - **Hirschfeld-Specific Flag Authorization:** `linear-calligraphic`, `continuous-contour`, `natural-hair-direction`, `strategic-black-fills`, `gesture-hierarchy-dominance`, `confident-line-energy`, `architectural-suggestion-minimal`, `structural-contrast-facial`.
  - **Anti-Illustration Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately economical line work that rejects detailed rendering.
  - **Face-Treatment Flags:** `linear-confidence`, `structural-contrast`
  - **Material Physics Authority:** Black india ink on cold-pressed illustration board with visible pen/brush confidence.
  - **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Movie poster viewing distance 3-6 feet affects line economy and gesture clarity.
  - **Publication Production Authenticity:** 1930s-1970s letterpress printing with characteristic imperfections.
  - **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.
  - **Text policy:** Typography required for movie poster format per Section 8.
  - **Safety/IP:** No copyrighted character elements; original character interpretations only.
  - **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Period-appropriate 1930s-1970s costume design.
  - **Material authenticity:** Authentic ink-on-paper with visible tool confidence, no digital simulation.
  - **Period Production Authenticity:** Halftone dots 65-85 LPI, color registration drift ±2mm.
  - **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; typography integrated within poster space.
  - **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid uniform line weights, random hair direction, excessive clothing detail.
  - **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

  ## Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

  - **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (standard movie poster) - ignore source image dimensions completely.
  - Redraw in **Al Hirschfeld linear calligraphic style** for **1930s-1970s movie poster format**.
  - Identity via signature gesture/expression/silhouette - never anatomical accuracy.
  - **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original character interpretations avoiding copyrighted elements.
  - Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `structural-contrast`
  - Declare **Pose Flag:** `gesture-hierarchy-dominance`
  - Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
  - **Style Dominance:** Hirschfeld's confident line economy supersedes realistic representation.
  - **Mode Selector:** Movie poster commercial format.

  ------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

  **MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (standard movie poster format)

  **CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

  - **Reframing Method:** recompose-entirely
  - **Spatial Allocation:** Character dominance 65-75% of vertical space, typography zones 25-35%
  - **Background Treatment:** Pure white space or minimal architectural suggestion maximum 2% visual weight
  - **Format Justification:** 2:3 ratio optimizes for theater lobby display at 3-6 foot viewing distance

  ------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

  - **Influences:** Japanese woodblock prints (line economy), commercial poster constraints (visual impact), theatrical performance vocabulary (gesture essence).
  - **Medium/Production method:** Black india ink on cold-pressed illustration board with pen and brush; letterpress printing with halftone screens 65-85 LPI.
  - **Thematic purpose:** Commercial entertainment promotion through character essence and dominant gesture capture.
  - **Hallmark motifs with specifications:**
    - Continuous contour line: Single unbroken line defines 60-80% of figure silhouette
    - Natural hair direction: Parallel strokes following hair's natural growth patterns, 8-15 strokes per hair section
    - Strategic black fills: Pure black areas for formal wear contrast (tuxedos, evening gowns) occupying 15-25% of figure
    - Confident line energy: Every stroke suggests personality and movement, never careful illustration
    - Gesture hierarchy dominance: One primary gesture occupies 40-60% of compositional space
    - Structural facial contrast: Bold architectural lines 2-3mm contrasting delicate details 0.5-1mm
    - Architectural suggestion: Environmental elements indicated with 5-10 lines maximum
  - **Period framing:** Golden Age Hollywood 1930s-1970s theatrical entertainment.
  - **Tone Tag:** Confident, economical, theatrical essence capture.
  - **Production Era Authenticity:** Letterpress limitations - solid fills only, halftone dots visible, registration drift.

  ------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

  **Line Quality Specifications:**

  - **Weight variation mastery:** 0.5mm delicate details swelling to 3-4mm bold structural elements within confident strokes
  - **Hair direction authenticity:** Parallel curved strokes following natural hair growth patterns, 8-15 strokes per section
  - **Strategic black fill placement:** Pure black areas for formal wear creating dramatic contrast, 15-25% of figure coverage
  - **Continuous contour confidence:** Uninterrupted line flow defining 60-80% of figure silhouette
  - **Clothing indication economy:** Silhouette plus 2-4 major fold lines, strategic black fills for formal wear

  **Line Weight Variation Enhancement:**

  - **Dramatic contrast requirement:** Minimum 4:1 ratio between bold structural lines (2-4mm) and delicate details (0.5-1mm)
  - **Cheekbone architecture:** Bold diagonal structural line 3-4mm weight defining primary facial plane, creating strong shadow indication
  - **Feature detail precision:** Eyes, nose, mouth rendered with 0.5-1mm delicate strokes, maximum 2-3 strokes per feature
  - **Structural hierarchy:** Jaw, cheekbone, neck outline use 2-4mm bold confident strokes contrasting facial interior details

  **Hair Treatment Anchors:**

  - **Curly hair technique:** Parallel curved strokes following natural curl direction, 8-15 per section
  - **Straight hair technique:** Clean directional flow with minimal stroke count, maximum 6-10 defining strokes
  - **Textural hair areas:** Dense parallel hatching following natural patterns, never random or decorative
  - **Volume indication:** Achieved through directional stroke energy, not cross-hatching density

  **Clothing Rendering Anchors:**

  - **Formal wear strategy:** Strategic pure black fills for tuxedos, evening gowns creating dramatic contrast
  - **Fabric pattern indication:** Crosshatch/stipple contained within garment silhouettes, never bleeding into background
  - **Fold line economy:** 2-4 major fold indicators maximum per garment
  - **Silhouette primacy:** Clothing shape defined first, details subordinated to overall form

  **Pose Anchors:**

  - **Gesture hierarchy:** One dominant action (piano playing, conducting, cocktail holding) defines character essence
  - **Compositional focus:** Primary gesture occupies 40-60% of available space
  - **Secondary element subordination:** All other elements support primary character action
  - **Anatomical accuracy within economy:** Correct proportions maintained despite stylistic simplification

  **Scale Hierarchy:** Character head 15-25% of poster height, dominant gesture elements 8-15% of total composition **Material Authenticity:** Visible pen confidence in structural lines, brush energy in hair sections **Period Consistency:** 1930s-1970s theatrical costume and gesture vocabulary **Production Method:** Halftone dots 65-85 LPI for limited color areas, letterpress characteristics **Canvas Adaptation:** Composition optimized for 2:3 vertical format with typography integration

  - **Silhouette primacy:** Clothing shape established first, details subordinated

  **Accessory caps:** Minimalist 1-2 elements supporting gesture hierarchy (bow ties, pearl strands, formal gloves) **Color palette:**

  - **Primary:** Black india ink on cream/white paper stock
  - **Strategic black fills:** 15-25% of figure coverage for formal wear contrast
  - **Accent colors:** Single spot color maximum 20% coverage if used

  **Wardrobe variation:** Cycle through period theatrical elegance - formal evening wear, performance costumes, sophisticated day wear **Props:** 1 hero prop maximum supporting dominant gesture, total ≤2 elements **Coherence filter:** All elements support 1930s-1970s theatrical sophistication

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

  **2:3 POSTER COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

  - **Character dominance:** 65-75% of vertical space with gesture hierarchy emphasis
  - **Typography zones:** Header 15-20%, footer 10-15% flowing around figure silhouette
  - **Background treatment:** Pure white space or minimal architectural suggestion maximum 2% visual weight

  **Hirschfeld-Specific Composition:**

  - **Gesture hierarchy dominance:** One primary action (piano playing, conducting, cocktail holding) defines composition

  - **Line confidence throughout:** Every element suggests energy and personality through economical stroke work
  - **Theatrical vocabulary:** Poses drawn from 1930s-1970s stage and screen performance traditions

  **Minimal Environmental Integration:**

  - **Architectural suggestion:** Maximum 2-4 confident strokes indicating performance spaces, never competing with figure
  - **Atmospheric elements:** Omit radiating lines, halos, or decorative background effects entirely
  - **Furniture indication:** Maximum 3-5 line suggestions for essential props (music stands, pianos) - stark simplicity only

  **Strategic Black Fill Usage:**

  - **Formal wear contrast:** Tuxedos, evening gowns rendered as pure black shapes creating drama
  - **Background separation:** Black clothing elements separate figure from white background
  - **Visual hierarchy:** Black fills direct eye to primary gesture and character essence

  **REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

  - **Surface Context:** Cold-pressed illustration board, india ink absorption characteristics
  - **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely - typography integrated within poster composition
  - **Production Context:** 1930s-1970s letterpress limitations and characteristic registration drift
  - **Gesture Hierarchy Enforcement:** Entire composition organized around one dominant character-defining action

  ------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

  **Typography REQUIRED for movie poster format**

  **2:3 POSTER-APPROPRIATE ZONES:**

  - **Header zone:** 15-20% of poster height for title treatment complementing figure silhouette
  - **Footer zone:** 10-15% of poster height for credits positioned to support overall composition
  - **Integration method:** Typography flows around and complements figure, never competing with line work

  **Copy limits:**

  - **Title:** ≤4 words, confident theatrical lettering
  - **Credits:** ≤12 elements maximum, hierarchical sizing 8-24pt range
  - **Tagline:** ≤6 words supporting theatrical theme

  **Period-Appropriate Typography:**

  - **1950s-1960s:** Modern sans-serif with theatrical flair, clean confident spacing
  - **1970s:** Bold display typography with performance energy, expanded character spacing

  **Font recommendation:**

  - *Closest Google Font: Bebas Neue (condensed theatrical confidence, 80%). Better: Custom theatrical display lettering.*

  **Format-Specific Rules:**

  - **Movie poster mode:** Mandatory 2:3 vertical, title integrated with gesture hierarchy
  - **Typography confidence:** Lettering shows same assured energy as figure line work
  - **Viewing distance:** 3-6 feet optimized sizing minimum 18pt for theatrical lobby visibility
  - **Theatrical vocabulary:** Type treatment supports entertainment industry conventions

  **Production Integration:** Typography rendered with period letterpress characteristics - solid colors, slight registration drift, impression depth matching overall production authenticity.
