## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (standard movie poster) - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Saul Bass modernist symbolic style** for **1950s-1970s movie poster format**.
- Identity via single dominant symbol/metaphor representing film's core theme.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original symbolic interpretations avoiding copyrighted imagery and real studio names/logos.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `geometric-reduction`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `symbolic-representation`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Bass's "symbolize and summarize" philosophy supersedes literal representation.
- **Mode Selector:** Movie poster commercial format.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (standard movie poster format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** recompose-entirely
- **Spatial Allocation:** Dominant symbol 60-80% of canvas space, typography 15-25%, negative space 5-15%
- **Background Treatment:** Single solid color field or geometric pattern maximum 20% complexity
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 ratio optimized for theater lobby impact at 6-10 foot viewing distance

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Bauhaus modernism (geometric simplicity), Hungarian design school (symbolic communication), 1950s American commercial art constraints.
- **Medium/Production method:** Offset printing with hand-separated color plates; halftone screens 85-133 LPI characteristic of period technology.
- **Thematic purpose:** "Symbolize and summarize" film's core psychological or thematic essence into single powerful metaphor.
- **Hallmark motifs with specifications:**
  - Single dominant symbol: One central metaphor occupies 60-80% of visual weight
  - Limited color palette psychology: 2-3 colors maximum chosen for emotional resonance (red=tension, blue=cool/corporate, yellow=energy/madness)
  - Geometric construction: Pure shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) provide structural foundation
  - Hand-drawn typography integration: Custom letterforms become part of visual metaphor
  - Strategic negative space: Empty areas create focus and visual tension, 10-25% of composition
  - Halftone authenticity: Visible dot patterns from period offset printing technology
- **Period framing:** Golden Age Hollywood 1950s-1970s modernist design revolution.
- **Tone Tag:** Intelligent minimalism, psychological symbolism, commercial impact.
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Offset printing limitations - solid color separations, halftone dot visibility, color registration imperfections ±1.5mm.

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Color Strategy Specifications:**

- **Palette limitation:** Maximum 2-3 colors plus black/white, chosen for psychological impact
- **Color psychology application:** Red (violence/passion/danger), Blue (corporate/cool/melancholy), Yellow (madness/energy/optimism), Orange (tension/unease)
- **Saturation requirements:** Pure, unmixed colors at 100% saturation for maximum impact
- **Color area distribution:** Dominant color 60-75% coverage, accent color 15-25%, third color 5-10% maximum

**Geometric Construction Anchors:**

- **Single symbol dominance:** One central metaphor occupies 60-80% of visual composition weight
- **Geometric foundation:** Pure shapes (perfect circles, precise rectangles, clean triangles) underlying all elements
- **Mathematical proportions:** Golden ratio or modular scale governing size relationships
- **Edge precision:** Clean, sharp boundaries between color areas and shapes

**Typography Integration Anchors:**

- **Hand-drawn letterform requirement:** Custom typography designed specifically for each composition, never standard fonts
- **Typography as graphic element:** Letters integrated into overall symbolic metaphor, not applied afterward
- **Scale hierarchy:** Film title dominant (occupying 15-25% of composition), credits subordinated to 5-10%
- **Letterform construction:** Sans-serif modernist influence with custom proportions and spacing

**Symbolic Construction Anchors:**

- **Character essence distillation:** When human figures appear, reduce to 3-4 distinctive geometric elements that capture recognizable silhouette (Eastwood's jaw line, distinctive hair profile, signature gesture)
- **Geometric character abstraction:** Transform recognizable features into pure geometric shapes while maintaining character recognition
- **Metaphorical precision:** Symbol must communicate specific film experience, not generic concept (Vertigo's spiral = specific disorientation, not general confusion)
- **Reductive elimination process:** Start complex, eliminate all non-essential elements until only purest symbolic essence remains

**Production Method Anchors:**

- **Halftone dot pattern:** Visible 85-133 LPI characteristic of 1950s-70s offset printing
- **Color registration drift:** Slight misalignment ±1.5mm typical of period printing technology
- **Paper stock influence:** Design accounts for newsprint/poster stock ink absorption
- **Printing separation:** Colors designed for hand-separated plates, not digital blending

**Scale Hierarchy:** Dominant symbol 60-80% visual weight, title typography 15-25%, credits/studio info 5-10% **Material Authenticity:** Visible printing artifacts consistent with period offset technology **Period Consistency:** All elements reflect 1950s-1970s modernist design principles and production limitations **Canvas Adaptation:** Composition optimized specifically for 2:3 vertical poster format

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Symbolic Representation Strategy:** Abstract silhouettes eliminate specific wardrobe concerns

- **Male representation:** Clean geometric silhouettes suggesting formal wear or action poses
- **Female representation:** Elegant curved silhouettes maintaining dignity and sophistication
- **Universal figures:** Gender-neutral shapes when thematic focus transcends individual identity

**Color coding:** Clothing/figures rendered in solid color shapes without pattern detail **Accessory integration:** Props become symbolic elements (weapons=danger, flowers=romance, geometric objects=psychological states) **Period authenticity:** Silhouettes reflect 1950s-70s fashion proportions when human figures appear **Symbolic hierarchy:** Human figures subordinated to central metaphor unless they ARE the metaphor

**Props reduced to symbolic essence:**

```yaml
symbolic_props:
  psychological_thriller: [spiral, fragmented_mirror, geometric_eye, abstract_staircase, broken_clock]
  crime_drama: [angular_gun, balance_scales, gavel_silhouette, prison_bars, shadow_profile]
  romance: [heart_geometry, intertwined_circles, abstract_figures, flowing_curves, unity_symbols]
  war_drama: [helmet_silhouette, crossed_elements, medal_shapes, flag_geometry, memorial_crosses]
  comedy: [balloon_clusters, geometric_faces, playful_shapes, number_sequences, party_elements]
```

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**2:3 POSTER COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Symbol dominance:** Central metaphor occupies 60-80% of visual weight
- **Typography zones:** Title integration 15-25%, credits 5-10% positioned for hierarchy
- **Background treatment:** Single solid color field or simple geometric pattern maximum 20% complexity

**Bass-Specific Composition:**

- **Geometric foundation:** All elements constructed on mathematical grid or proportional system
- **Negative space strategy:** Empty areas create tension and focus, 10-25% of composition
- **Visual hierarchy:** Symbol > Title > Credits in descending order of visual impact
- **Color area balance:** Dominant color 60-75%, secondary 15-25%, accent 5-10%

**Symbolic Integration Requirements:**

- **Central metaphor clarity:** Single symbol immediately communicates film's core theme
- **Cultural universality:** Design readable across demographic and linguistic boundaries
- **Psychological impact:** Color and form choices designed for emotional resonance
- **Commercial effectiveness:** Design functions at poster size and newspaper reproduction

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context:** Offset printing on poster stock or newsprint, authentic paper texture influence
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Clean geometric borders only, no decorative framing elements
- **Production Context:** 1950s-1970s offset printing technology with characteristic limitations
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** All elements designed specifically for 2:3 vertical format

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Typography REQUIRED as integral design element**

**2:3 POSTER-APPROPRIATE ZONES:**

- **Title integration:** 15-25% of visual weight, custom letterforms integrated into symbolic metaphor
- **Credits hierarchy:** 5-10% of composition, clean sans-serif positioning supporting overall design
- **Studio information:** Minimal presence, positioned to maintain design integrity

**Copy limits:**

- **Title:** Custom hand-drawn letterforms, never standard fonts
- **Credits:** Essential information only, maximum 12 elements hierarchically organized
- **Tagline:** Eliminated unless essential to symbolic communication

**Hand-Drawn Typography Requirements:**

- **CRITICAL: No standard fonts permitted:** Every letterform must be custom-designed as unique geometric construction
- **Letterform-as-symbol integration:** Typography becomes structural part of central metaphor, not decorative overlay
- **Geometric letterform construction:** Each letter built from pure geometric elements (circles, rectangles, triangles) with mathematical precision
- **Extreme reduction philosophy:** Maximum 3-4 geometric elements per letterform, eliminate all decorative serifs or flourishes
- **Structural integration:** Letters share geometric language with central symbol, creating unified design system

**Font recommendation:**

- *Bass drew custom letterforms for each poster. Modern recreation requires hand-drawing inspired by Bauhaus modernist principles. Avoid all standard digital fonts.*

**Format-Specific Rules:**

- **Movie poster mode:** Mandatory 2:3 vertical, title integrated into symbolic metaphor
- **Typography symbolism:** Letterforms support and enhance central thematic metaphor
- **Viewing distance:** 6-10 feet optimized letter sizing for theater lobby impact
- **Commercial clarity:** All text readable at poster scale and newspaper reproduction

**Production Integration:** Typography rendered with period offset printing characteristics - solid colors, halftone patterns when applicable, slight registration variations authentic to hand-separated plates.
