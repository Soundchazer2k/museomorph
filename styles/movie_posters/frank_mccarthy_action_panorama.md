## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**Canvas Negatives (≥2):**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "soft atmospheric focus"
- "impressionistic effects", "modern digital smoothing", "static formal poses"
- "anachronistic elements", "vague historical details", "passive compositions"

**Canvas Positives (≥2):**

- "exactly cinematic ratio recomposition", "sharp focus throughout 100% of canvas"
- "oil paint texture with visible brushwork", "anatomical precision at museum standards"
- "dramatic action poses with forward momentum", "specific time-of-day natural lighting"
- "historical accuracy in all period elements", "reportorial immediacy composition"

**Vocabulary warnings:** Avoid "atmospheric," "impressionistic," "soft focus" for technique. Avoid "static," "formal," "decorative" for pose descriptions.

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**CINEMATIC RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Wide format emphasis:** Dramatic action optimized for 2:3 to 1:2 aspect ratios with cinematic staging
- **Environmental integration:** Western landscapes or period settings occupying 30-40% as active narrative participants
- **Figure dominance:** Action characters commanding 60-70% with heroic scale and dynamic positioning

**MCCARTHY-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Gestural action fluidity:** All figures captured in peak dramatic movement with anatomical precision
- **Crystal clarity staging:** Sharp focus across entire composition creating "vacuum effect" with no atmospheric interference
- **Natural lighting logic:** Documented time-of-day illumination with consistent directional shadows and 70-80% contrast
- **Cinematic framing regime:** Linear perspective with reportorial immediacy placing viewer within action
- **Historical environmental character:** Period-accurate settings serving as dramatic stage with sharp detail

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Traditional oil on canvas with visible brushwork texture suitable for museum display
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Commercial period = typography integration; Fine art period = omit entirely
- **Production Context Anchor:** Commercial = poster printing compatibility; Fine art = gallery presentation standards
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** All elements composed specifically for chosen cinematic format with optimal dramatic impact

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**PERIOD-SPECIFIC BINARY SELECTION:**

**Commercial Illustration Period (1948-1968): ALLOW**

- **Cinematic Poster Layout:** Typography integrated dynamically within action composition, not static overlay
- **Copy limits:** Movie title + star billing + studio credits, positioned for cinematic ratio optimization
- **Period-Appropriate Typography:** 1950s-1960s movie poster fonts with dimensional effects and dramatic integration
- **Font recommendation:** *Bold display fonts with cinematic presence. Digital approximation: Bebas Neue, Impact, or Univers as starting points requiring customization for period authenticity.*
- **Integration method:** Typography works with composition flow, often integrated into environmental elements or dramatic lighting
- **Production standards:** High-quality poster printing with crisp typography and color reproduction
- **Viewing distance:** Theater lobby and newspaper advertisement readability optimization

**Western Fine Art Period (1974-2002): OMIT**

- **Pure pictorial narrative:** No typography, lettering, logos, or graphic design elements permitted
- **Museum presentation:** Canvas displays narrative through visual composition only
- **Gallery standards:** Traditional fine art presentation without commercial text elements
- **Collector focus:** Oil paintings valued as original artwork without poster marketing function

**Historical accuracy:** Typography (when used) must match commercial poster standards of the specific time period with authentic printing methods and dimensional lettering effects.

- Museum-quality oil painting technique with visible brushwork
- Historical accuracy in Western subjects (Plains Indians, mountain men, cavalry, cowboys)
- Environmental settings as active narrative participants

**Technical Consistency Across Periods:**

- Crystal-clear detail throughout 100% of compositions
- Anatomical precision based on academic training
- Natural lighting documentation with specific time-of-day effects
- Cinematic composition influence from commercial background
- Oil paint application with authentic texture and brushwork

**Narrative Structure Evidence:**

- Every composition captures pivotal dramatic moment
- No static poses - all figures engaged in narrative action
