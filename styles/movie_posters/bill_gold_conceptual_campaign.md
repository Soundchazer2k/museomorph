# Bill Gold

**Version:** 1.0
 **Purpose:** Authentic reproduction of Bill Gold's movie poster design technique (1940s-2000s) based on visual evidence analysis across his three major style periods. Enforces his signature photo-offset lithography production methods, dramatic character montages, and genre-adaptive stylistic evolution.

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always compose for standard movie poster format (20x14 inches approx.) - ignore source image dimensions.
- **Style over digital perfection:** Photo-offset lithography authenticity with visible spot color separations over modern digital smoothness.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("70-80% character dominance", "flat spot color planes", "visible screen tint dots") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Period-appropriate printing method simulation (spot color separations, screen tints, uncoated paper) supersedes modern digital aesthetics.
- **Gold-Specific Flags (choose one Face-Treatment by style period):**
  - *Classic Hollywood:* `dramatic-character-montage`, `light-shadow-modeling`, `hero-prop-integration`, `ensemble-hierarchy`
  - *Psychedelic Pop:* `vibrant-color-bombardment`, `repeating-imagery`, `geometric-framing`, `distorted-typography`
  - *Minimalist Symbolism:* `stark-silhouette`, `negative-space-dominance`, `single-concept-power`, `typography-as-art`
- **Pose Flags:** `distant-hero-gaze`, `engaging-viewer-connection`, `dramatic-lighting-reveal`, `prop-interaction`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (standard movie poster proportions)
- **Production Authenticity:** 1940s-1980s photo-offset lithography with spot color printing and screen tint textures
- **Material Physics Authority:** Flat multicolor printing plates, adhesive screen tint films, uncoated paper stock
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Theater lobby viewing distance affects character hierarchy and typography sizing
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** All numeric specifications target exact commercial poster requirements
- **Text policy:** Always include typography as integral design element - never afterthought overlay
- **Safety/IP:** No real actor likenesses; create original character designs appropriate to genre
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Adult presentation with period-appropriate costume design
- **Material authenticity:** Photo-offset lithography simulation with visible color separations - no modern digital gradients
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Mid-20th century commercial printing with characteristic spot color limitations
- **Composition boundaries:** Typography integrated as active compositional element within poster layout
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid modern CMYK halftones, avoid digital effects, avoid glossy surface appearance

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **20x14 inch movie poster ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Bill Gold period-specific poster design style** for **[STYLE PERIOD: Classic Hollywood / Psychedelic Pop / Minimalist Symbolism]**.
- Identity via dramatic character positioning, genre-appropriate mood, and storytelling hierarchy rather than portrait accuracy.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original character designs suitable for movie marketing without real actor likenesses.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** [Period-specific: `dramatic-character-montage` / `vibrant-color-bombardment` / `stark-silhouette`]
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `distant-hero-gaze`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Photo-offset lithography poster design with period-appropriate printing methods over modern digital approaches.
- **Mode Selector:** Movie poster (dramatic storytelling for theater marketing).

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `20:14` (standard movie poster format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Extend character montage or symbolic imagery to fill vertical poster format while preserving dramatic hierarchy
- **Spatial Allocation:**
  - Character dominance: 70-80% canvas coverage with hierarchical star positioning
  - Background context: 20-30% providing atmospheric support
  - Typography integration: 15-25% as active design element within composition
  - Negative space: Strategic use for dramatic impact and visual breathing room
- **Background Treatment:** Minimal atmospheric support serving character drama rather than competing for attention
- **Format Justification:** Standard poster dimensions optimize theater lobby display and newspaper reproduction

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Hollywood studio system star photography, Pop Art movement, Art Nouveau psychedelic aesthetics, J.C. Leyendecker illustration
- **Medium/Production method:** Photo-offset lithography with flat spot color separations, screen tint applications, hand-prepared camera-ready art
- **Thematic purpose:** Create immediate emotional connection and genre identification for movie marketing
- **5 hallmark motifs with quantifications:**
  1. **Dramatic character montage:** 3-5 characters with clear scale hierarchy, primary stars 40-50% larger than supporting cast
  2. **Hero prop exaggeration:** Key story elements (guns, phones, symbolic objects) enlarged 200-300% for focal emphasis
  3. **Genre-specific color schemes:** Classic noir (high contrast B&W + red accent), Psychedelic (electric pinks/yellows/oranges), Minimalist (monochromatic + single accent)
  4. **Typography as illustration:** Hand-drawn lettering occupying 15-25% canvas as active design element
  5. **Photo-offset texture authenticity:** Visible spot color separations with screen tint dot patterns for tonal variation
- **Period framing:** Classic Hollywood (1940s-1950s), Psychedelic counter-culture (1960s-1970s), Minimalist symbolism (1970s-1980s)
- **Tone Tag:** Sophisticated commercial appeal, genre-appropriate emotional resonance
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Mid-20th century photo-offset lithography with characteristic printing limitations and material qualities
