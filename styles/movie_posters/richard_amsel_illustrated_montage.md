## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over photography:** Illustrated portraiture supersedes photographic accuracy.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("controlled montage 65-80% coverage", "warm glowing color temperature 3200K-3800K") override descriptive language ("dynamic", "exciting").
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How mixed-media layers build up supersedes final appearance descriptions.
- **Amsel-Specific Flag Authorization:** `controlled-montage`, `mixed-media-layering`, `heroic-portraiture`, `period-reinterpretation`, `warm-glowing-palette`, `framing-device-thematic`, `larger-than-life-character`.
- **Anti-Photographic Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately illustrated, hand-drawn aesthetic that rejects photographic realism.
- **Face-Treatment Flags:** `heroic-portraiture`, `mixed-media-layering`, `personality-capture`
- **Material Physics Authority:** Mixed-media illustration technique with visible pencil work, paint washes, colored pencil details.
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Movie poster viewing distance affects portrait detail hierarchy and character montage organization.
- **Publication Production Authenticity:** 1970s-1980s offset printing with improved color registration, coated paper stock quality.
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Typography integrated as design element per Section 8.
- **Safety/IP:** No copyrighted character elements; original character interpretations avoiding real studio names.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Period-appropriate 1970s-1980s costume design with historical accuracy.
- **Gender expression:** Conveyed through heroic portraiture and period-appropriate characterization.
- **Material authenticity:** Mixed-media illustration board techniques with visible drawing/painting process.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1970s-80s improved offset printing, higher quality halftone screens 150+ LPI.
- **Composition boundaries:** Thematic framing devices when appropriate; no generic decorative borders.
