## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Conceptual symbolism via isolated motifs rather than literal representation.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("75-85% negative space", "offset lithography precision") override descriptive language ("minimal", "clean").
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** 1970s offset lithography production methods supersede digital perfection.
- **Conceptual Minimalism Authority:** Single symbolic concept supersedes narrative complexity.
- **Psychological Tension Authority:** Suspense generation without plot revelation takes precedence over literal depiction.

**Face-Treatment Flags (mandatory selection):**

- `offset-dot`: Clean offset lithography reproduction with hard edges
- `psychological-portrait`: Disembodied or partially obscured faces as mindscape elements
- `photographic-precision`: Sharp photographic clarity without painterly effects

**Pose Flags (mandatory selection):**

- `conceptual-positioning`: Symbolic placement serving psychological rather than literal narrative
- `isolated-vulnerability`: Subject positioning emphasizing solitude and tension
- `atmospheric-integration`: Figures integrated as psychological landscape elements

**Canvas Control Flags (mandatory selection):**

- `strict-reframe`: Exact 27"x41" (1:1.52) portrait ratio enforcement
- `negative-space-dominance`: 75-85% canvas devoted to empty space

**Production Authenticity Flags (mandatory selection):**

- `offset-lithography-1970s`: Flat color separations with hard edges, no CMYK rosettes
- `thin-paper-stock`: Matte finish poster paper, folded shipping characteristics
- `phototypesetting-precision`: Clean typography with spatial flexibility

**Material Physics Authority:** Substrate, tool, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences. **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Viewing distance requirements affect detail hierarchy and symbolic scale. **Cultural Production Authenticity:** Indigenous and traditional methods take precedence over modern interpretations. **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are targets. **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes. **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures. **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral. **Gender expression:** Respect presented. **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic medium characteristics. **Period Production Authenticity:** For historical publication styles, use period-appropriate printing methods, paper quality, and color registration limitations - avoid modern digital perfection. **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits. **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid narrative montages, literal plot depiction, ornate illustration, complex color palettes, visible halftone dots, newsprint texture, mechanical reproduction artifacts. **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `1:1.52` (27"x41" theatrical one-sheet)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Extend atmospheric negative space to fill exact 1:1.52 ratio
- **Spatial Allocation:** Central symbolic motif 10-20% canvas area, positioned for maximum psychological impact
- **Background Treatment:** Vast fields of flat color or subtle atmospheric gradients
- **Format Justification:** Portrait orientation maximizes psychological pressure and hierarchical text placement

**GIPS-SPECIFIC SPATIAL LOGIC:**

- Negative space dominance: 75-85% canvas area as active psychological element
- Central motif isolation: 10-20% visual weight positioned for maximum tension
- Figure-ground relationship: Stable ground overwhelming figure for dramatic imbalance
- Psychological pressure: Empty space creates palpable sense of isolation and vulnerability

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Saul Bass conceptual minimalism, 1970s modernist graphic design, phototypesetting revolution, New Hollywood cinema aesthetics

- **Hallmark motifs with specifications:**
  1. **Isolated conceptual symbol:** Single potent motif (baby carriage, cracking egg, symbolic object) occupying ≤20% canvas area
  2. **Looming psychological portrait:** Disembodied or partially obscured human face functioning as mindscape landscape
  3. **Dominant negative space:** 75-85% empty space serving as active psychological agent creating tension and isolation
  4. **Psychological color palettes:** Severely limited schemes - sickly greens, stark blacks, deep reds - applied as flat planes
  5. **Hard-edged graphic precision:** Clean offset lithography reproduction with no painterly texture or digital effects
- **Period framing:** Late 1960s through 1980s New Hollywood era
- **Tone Tag:** Psychological tension, conceptual minimalism, sophisticated suspense
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Offset lithography with phototypesetting flexibility, thin poster paper stock, pre-digital precision

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**BINARY DECISION:** Allow typography as essential structural element

**IF TYPOGRAPHY ALLOWED:**

- **Ratio-Appropriate Zones:** Typography separated from imagery, positioned in negative space areas
- **Copy limits:** Film title + tagline ≤8 words + standard credit hierarchy
- **Period-Appropriate Typography:** ITC Avant Garde Gothic or similar 1970s geometric sans-serif fonts

**GIPS-SPECIFIC TYPOGRAPHY:**

**Primary Recommendations:**

- **Title font:** ITC Avant Garde Gothic (Herb Lubalin/Tom Carnase, 1970). Closest Google Font: Futura (geometric sans-serif, 80% match). Better: Custom geometric sans with period precision
- **Tagline font:** Clean geometric sans-serif with psychological impact. Closest Google Font: Helvetica (utilitarian clarity, 85% match). Better: Univers with tight spacing
- **Credit block:** Standard hierarchical layout in lower portion, clean sans-serif presentation

**TYPOGRAPHY INTEGRATION RULES:**

- **Separation principle:** Typography exists within negative space, never overlapping central imagery
- **Hierarchy clarity:** Film title most prominent, tagline secondary, credits tertiary
- **Psychological taglines:** Short, provocative, memorable phrases supporting conceptual theme
- **Spatial treatment:** Phototypesetting flexibility allowing dramatic spacing and positioning

**PRODUCTION METHOD INTEGRATION:** Typography rendered with offset lithography precision - sharp edges, flat color application, perfect registration

**FORMAT-SPECIFIC RULES:**

- **Movie poster mode:** Essential title/tagline/credits required for commercial authenticity
- **Psychological impact:** Typography supports rather than competes with central symbolic concept
- **Period accuracy:** Fonts and spacing authentic to 1970s phototypesetting capabilities
