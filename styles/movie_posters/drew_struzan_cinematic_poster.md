# Drew Struzan

**Version:** 1.0
 **Purpose:** Authentic reproduction of Drew Struzan's cinematic poster illustration technique based on visual evidence analysis of 10 canonical examples (1985-2005 period). Enforces his signature montage composition, mixed-media layering method, and atmospheric color palette.

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always compose for `2:3` aspect ratio (standard movie poster format) - ignore source image dimensions.
- **Style over likeness:** Identity via warm portraiture and heroic gesture/expression, not photographic accuracy.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("60% background coverage", "3-4mm gesso texture", "40% character size differential") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Mixed-media layering sequence (gesso → pencil → paint → airbrush → colored pencil highlights) supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Struzan-Specific Flags (choose one Face-Treatment):**
  - *Core Technique:* `airbrushed-base-colored-pencil-highlights`, `gesso-tooth-foundation`, `warm-portrait-modeling`, `atmospheric-background-integration`
  - *Character Rendering:* `heroic-gesture-emphasis`, `warm-skin-lilac-shadows`, `sharp-pencil-highlights`, `midtone-sculptural-modeling`
  - *Background Treatment:* `organic-spatter-texture`, `amber-orange-gradients`, `atmospheric-depth-layers`, `montage-scene-integration`
- **Pose Flags:** `heroic-gesture`, `power-stance`, `romantic-embrace`, `action-frozen`, `contemplative-gaze`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (always 2:3 movie poster format)
- **Production Authenticity:** 1980s-1990s poster printing methods with halftone dots and slight registration drift
- **Material Physics Authority:** Gesso texture foundation, airbrush smoothness, colored pencil highlight precision
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Theatrical poster viewing distance affects detail hierarchy and contrast requirements
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** All numeric specifications are exact targets
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes with period-appropriate movie poster typography
- **Safety/IP:** No real actor likenesses; no trademarked logos; original character designs
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** All characters adult presentation; heroic costume design
- **Material authenticity:** Authentic airbrush gradients with colored pencil highlights - no digital photo effects or modern post-processing
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1980s-1990s offset printing with characteristic halftone patterns and ±1mm registration tolerance
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; integrate typography organically into atmospheric backgrounds
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid digital painting smoothness, avoid photographic realism, avoid modern digital gradients

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (movie poster format) - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Drew Struzan cinematic poster illustration style** for **theatrical one-sheet poster**.
- Identity via heroic portraiture, warm atmospheric modeling, and dramatic gesture.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original heroic character designs avoiding real actor likenesses and trademarked costume elements.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `airbrushed-base-colored-pencil-highlights`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `heroic-gesture`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Mixed-media illustration technique over photographic realism.
- **Mode Selector:** Theatrical poster (hero-focused montage composition).

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (theatrical movie poster standard)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Extend atmospheric background to fill vertical poster format
- **Spatial Allocation:**
  - Main character portrait: 35-45% of canvas height, positioned upper-center
  - Supporting characters: 20-30% height, flanking main character
  - Action scene integration: 25-35% background coverage, lower third
  - Atmospheric sky/space: 40-50% upper background
- **Background Treatment:** Seamless airbrush gradient transition from warm amber (center) to deep space blue/purple (edges)
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 ratio optimizes character hierarchy and theatrical poster readability from theater lobby distance

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Golden Age Hollywood poster art, Norman Rockwell portraiture, classical academic painting, 1980s airbrush commercial art
- **Medium/Production method:** Mixed-media on gessoed illustration board - pencil foundation, acrylic paint darks, airbrush color layers, Prismacolor colored pencil highlights and details
- **Thematic purpose:** Heroic adventure cinema marketing - promise wonder, excitement, and larger-than-life characters
- **5 hallmark motifs with quantifications:**
  1. **Montage character portraits:** 3-5 characters with 40% size differential between hero and supporting cast
  2. **Warm atmospheric backgrounds:** 60-70% amber/orange gradient coverage with 20-30% deep blue space
  3. **Organic spatter texture:** 15-25% surface coverage using typewriter brush technique
  4. **Sharp colored pencil highlights:** 2-3mm wide white accents over warm airbrush base
  5. **Integrated action scenes:** 25-35% dramatic scene overlay at 40% transparency behind character portraits
- **Period framing:** Peak Hollywood blockbuster era (1980s-1990s) when practical effects and earnest heroism defined adventure cinema
- **Tone Tag:** Optimistic adventure, nostalgic wonder, heroic aspiration
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Pre-digital poster era printing with halftone dot patterns and slight color registration drift

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Gesso Foundation Anchor:** 2-3mm thick gesso texture applied with palette knife creating organic "tooth" surface for pencil adhesion
- **Three-Tone Composition Anchor:** Simplified value structure - 30% black darks, 50% warm midtones, 20% bright highlights
- **Airbrush Gradient Anchor:** Smooth color transitions covering 60-80% background area with visible overspray texture at edges
- **Colored Pencil Highlight Anchor:** Sharp 1-2mm white Prismacolor pencil strokes applied over airbrush areas, catching gesso texture peaks
- **Organic Spatter Anchor:** Black paint spatter using typewriter cleaning brush covering 10-20% surface with 0.5-2mm droplet sizes
- **Character Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Main character 40-50% larger than supporting characters, positioned 10-15% above canvas center
- **Warm Skin Modeling Anchor:** Peach/amber base tones with lilac/purple shadow areas, enhanced 20% warmer than photographic reference
- **Atmospheric Integration Anchor:** Background elements blend seamlessly into character edges using 10-15mm soft airbrush transitions
- **Registration Tolerance Anchor:** Slight color separation drift ±1mm to simulate period offset printing limitations
- **Fixative Layer Anchor:** Workable fixative spray between pencil and airbrush stages allowing subsequent colored pencil highlights

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks:** Heroic adventure costume design (adult presentation)

- **Fabric behavior:** Leather jackets with worn patina, flowing capes with dramatic drape, practical adventure gear with lived-in authenticity
- **Color palette restrictions:** Earth tones, warm browns, deep blues, avoiding bright primaries except for hero accent colors
- **Wardrobe variation required:** Cycle through adventure archetypes - pilot jackets, wizard robes, space pilot uniforms, safari gear
- **Props:** 1-2 genre-appropriate signature items (≤2 total) with thematic coherence
- **Coherence filter:** All elements must match specific film genre; fallback = clean character presentation

**GENRE-SPECIFIC PROP POOLS:**

```yaml
sci_fi_adventure: [ray_gun, spacecraft, time_device, alien_artifact, futuristic_gadget]
fantasy_adventure: [enchanted_sword, magic_wand, crystal_orb, ancient_scroll, mystical_amulet] 
action_adventure: [whip, fedora, treasure_map, rope, expedition_gear]
space_opera: [lightsaber, blaster, hologram_projector, spacecraft, alien_technology]
comedy_adventure: [everyday_objects_as_props, civilian_items, mundane_equipment]
horror_thriller: [scientific_equipment, survival_gear, communication_device, weapons]
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**Canvas Negatives (≥2):**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "photographic realism"
- "digital painting smoothness", "modern gradient effects", "harsh artificial lighting"
- "geometric perfection", "clinical cleanliness", "flat color application"

**Canvas Positives (≥2):**

- "exactly 2:3 movie poster ratio", "recomposed for theatrical format"
- "gesso texture foundation with 2-3mm tooth", "airbrush gradient base with colored pencil highlights"
- "warm amber atmospheric backgrounds", "organic spatter texture patterns"
- "1980s offset printing characteristics with halftone dots"

**Vocabulary warnings:** Avoid "ornate," "elaborate" for background elements. Avoid "harsh," "clinical," "digital" for technique descriptions.

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**2:3 POSTER-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Vertical emphasis:** Character portraits dominate upper 60% of canvas
- **Hierarchical staging:** Main character 35-45% canvas height, supporting characters 20-30%, action scenes 25-35% background integration
- **Atmospheric depth:** 4-layer background system - deep space/sky (back), atmospheric glow (mid-back), action scene integration (mid-front), character portraits (front)

**STRUZAN-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Montage perspective:** Multiple character portraits at varying scales arranged in triangular composition
- **Atmospheric integration:** Seamless blending between character edges and background using 10-15mm airbrush transitions
- **Warm gradient logic:** Center-bright (amber/orange) radiating to edge-dark (blue/purple) with 60-70% warm tone coverage
- **Action scene overlay:** Dramatic moment from story integrated at 40% transparency behind character portraits
- **Organic texture distribution:** Spatter patterns concentrated in atmospheric areas, avoided in character faces

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Gessoed illustration board with organic texture suitable for mixed-media layering
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely - integrate typography organically into atmospheric backgrounds
- **Production Context Anchor:** 1980s-1990s offset poster printing with halftone patterns and registration tolerance
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** All elements composed specifically for 2:3 theatrical poster format with lobby viewing distance optimization

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Allow (essential for movie poster format)

**Typography specifications:**

- **2:3 Poster Layout:** Title positioned lower third, 15-20% canvas height, with atmospheric background integration
- **Copy limits:** Movie title + 3-4 key credits maximum, positioned for 2:3 ratio readability
- **Period-Appropriate Typography:** 1980s-1990s movie poster fonts with dimensional effects and edge lighting
- **Font recommendation:** *Closest match: Cinzel (classical carved feel). Better: Trajan Pro or custom carved dimensional lettering.*
- **Integration method:** Typography emerges from atmospheric backgrounds using airbrush glow effects and colored pencil edge highlights
- **Production limitations:** Halftone dot patterns in solid color areas, slight registration drift in multi-color text effects
- **Hierarchy:** Title dominates (15-20% canvas height), credits integrated subtly into lower atmospheric areas
- **Viewing distance:** Typography sized for 10-foot theater lobby readability

**Historical accuracy:** Typography rendered with period offset printing characteristics including halftone patterns and ±1mm registration tolerance.
