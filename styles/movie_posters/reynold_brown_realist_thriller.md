# Reynold Brown

**Version:** 1.0
 **Purpose:** Authentic reproduction of Reynold Brown's 1950s sensationalized movie poster illustration technique based on visual evidence analysis of 13 canonical examples (1951-1970 period). Enforces his signature "lurid gusto," forward-directed energy, and commercial lithographic production constraints.

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always compose for standard movie poster formats (27x41 inches primary) - ignore source image dimensions.
- **Style over subtlety:** Maximum emotional impact and theatrical exaggeration over nuanced or artistic restraint.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("70-80% figure dominance", "3-5x monster scale", "90%+ color saturation") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Gouache on artist board → cheap lithographic reproduction sequence supersedes idealized digital rendering.
- **Brown-Specific Flags (choose one Face-Treatment):**
  - *Core Technique:* `gouache-broad-brush`, `lurid-color-bombardment`, `forward-thrust-energy`, `lithographic-reproduction`
  - *Character Rendering:* `archetype-formula`, `explicit-emotionality`, `scale-hierarchy`, `theatrical-exaggeration`
  - *Background Treatment:* `chaos-celebration`, `destruction-vignettes`, `visible-brushwork`, `commercial-showmanship`
- **Pose Flags:** `aggressive-forward`, `protective-clinch`, `terrified-screaming`, `monster-menacing`, `romantic-embrace`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (standard movie poster dimensions)
- **Production Authenticity:** 1950s-1960s cheap commercial lithography with visible halftone screens and registration drift
- **Material Physics Authority:** Opaque gouache application with visible brush strokes, no airbrush smoothness
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Drive-in theater and lobby viewing distance affects detail hierarchy and contrast requirements
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** All numeric specifications are exact commercial targets
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes with hand-drawn illustrative lettering
- **Safety/IP:** No real actor likenesses; use archetypal character designs
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Adult presentation with period-appropriate sensational costume design
- **Material authenticity:** Authentic gouache texture with commercial lithographic reproduction characteristics - no digital smoothing
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Mass-market poster printing with characteristic imperfections and dot patterns
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; integrate typography as active illustration elements
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid airbrush smoothness, avoid digital gradients, avoid subtle emotional restraint

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **27x41 inch ratio** (standard one-sheet format) - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Reynold Brown 1950s sensationalized poster illustration style** for **drive-in theater marketing**.
- Identity via archetypal character formulas and maximum theatrical expression rather than realistic portraiture.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original archetypal character designs following Brown's commercial formulas without real actor likenesses.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `gouache-broad-brush`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `aggressive-forward`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Commercial gouache illustration with lithographic reproduction over fine art or digital approaches.
- **Mode Selector:** Sensational poster (maximum emotional manipulation for ticket sales).

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `27:41` (standard movie one-sheet format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Extend chaos and destruction backgrounds to fill vertical poster format while preserving forward-thrusting elements
- **Spatial Allocation:**
  - Main figures: 70-80% canvas dominance with aggressive positioning
  - Monsters/threats: 3-5x human scale, breaking picture plane boundaries
  - Background chaos: 40-60% coverage with destruction vignettes
  - Typography integration: 15-25% with dynamic overlapping placement
- **Background Treatment:** Chaotic destruction scenes with visible brush stroke energy and high contrast
- **Format Justification:** 27x41 ratio optimizes dramatic impact for drive-in theater visibility and lobby display

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**Canvas Negatives (≥2):**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "artistic subtlety"
- "airbrush smoothness", "digital gradients", "emotional restraint"
- "realistic proportions", "quiet compositions", "muted colors"

**Canvas Positives (≥2):**

- "exactly 27x41 movie poster ratio", "recomposed for drive-in theater format"

- "cheap lithographic reproduction with halftone dots and ±2mm registration drift"

**Vocabulary warnings:** Avoid "subtle," "refined," "artistic" for approach. Avoid "smooth," "blended," "photographic" for technique descriptions.

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**27x41 POSTER-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Vertical emphasis:** Main threat/action dominating upper 70% of canvas with forward thrust toward viewer
- **Commercial staging:** Maximum visual impact optimized for drive-in theater visibility and lobby competition
- **Archetypal positioning:** Clear character hierarchy with monsters looming over heroes protecting damsels

**BROWN-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Aggressive forward energy:** 60% of major elements breaking picture plane with measurable 30-45 degree thrust angles
- **Figure-to-ground dominance:** 70-80% canvas coverage by main characters with clear commercial hierarchy
- **Chaos background integration:** 40-60% destruction vignettes (falling buildings, fleeing crowds, explosive action)
- **Scale exaggeration logic:** Monsters 3-5x human scale, male heads 20-30% larger than female heads
- **Theatrical emotionality:** All expressions at maximum intensity - no ambiguous or subtle emotional states

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Artist board suitable for gouache application with commercial reproduction in mind
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely - integrate typography as active illustration elements within composition
- **Production Context Anchor:** 1950s-1960s cheap lithographic printing with characteristic mass-market imperfections
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** All elements composed specifically for 27x41 standard one-sheet format with drive-in viewing optimization

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Allow (essential for commercial movie poster function)

**Typography specifications:**

- **27x41 Poster Layout:** Hand-drawn title integrated dynamically within illustration, not static placement
- **Copy limits:** Movie title + key star names + tagline maximum, all hand-rendered with genre-specific characteristics
- **Period-Appropriate Typography:** 1950s custom illustrative lettering with dynamic distortions and genre-specific effects

**Genre-Specific Font Treatments:**

- **Gothic Horror/Creature Features:** Dripping, distressed lettering with angular serifs. *Digital approximation: Creepster or Chiller as starting point.*
- **Sci-Fi/Atomic Age:** Futuristic block letters with technological effects, chrome-like rendering. *Digital approximation: Orbitron or Exo as starting point.*
- **Teenage Drama/Crime:** Bold, rebellious hand-lettering with casual brush strokes. *Digital approximation: Bangers or Permanent Marker as starting point.*
- **Romance/Melodrama:** Elegant script with flowing curves and dimensional shading. *Digital approximation: Dancing Script or Pacifico as starting point.*
- **Action/Adventure:** Robust block letters with impact effects and dimensional depth. *Digital approximation: Impact or Bebas Neue as starting point.*
- **Comedy/Satire:** Playful, irregular lettering with bouncy characteristics. *Digital approximation: Fredoka One or Bungee as starting point.*

**All digital approximations require heavy customization with hand-drawn distortions, dimensional effects, and lithographic reproduction characteristics.**

- **Integration method:** Typography overlaps figures, recedes into backgrounds, looms in foregrounds as active compositional elements
- **Production limitations:** Hand-lettered characteristics with lithographic reproduction imperfections and registration drift
- **Viewing distance:** Typography sized for drive-in theater screen visibility and lobby impact

**Historical accuracy:** Typography rendered with period hand-lettering techniques showing commercial lithographic reproduction characteristics including halftone patterns and registration tolerance.
