  McGinnis sold spy thrillers with gouache heroics-razor silhouettes, towering femme fatales, and jewel-toned couture floating
  against immaculate white. This card revives his 1960s-80s mixed-media workflow for contemporary posters.

# Robert McGinnis

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("1.3:1 facial ratio", "15° eyebrow arch", "30% fabric reflectivity") override descriptive language ("elongated", "arched", "shiny").
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How gouache paint is applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** McGinnis-specific flags permitted when standard options fail authenticity requirements.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately uncomfortable or challenging aesthetics when historically accurate.
- **Face-Treatment Flags:** `gouache-opaque`, `brush-loaded-single-stroke`, `hard-edge-commercial`, `flesh-tone-layered`, `highlight-pink-undertone`
- **Pose Flags:** `contrapposto-15-30-degrees`, `power-stance-female`, `candid-motion-frozen`, `psychological-tension`
- **Canvas Control Flags:** `strict-reframe`, `format-native`
- **Media Hybrid Flag:** `gouache-airbrush-combination`
- **Material Physics Authority:** Gouache opacity, brush economy, and commercial printing limitations override aesthetic preferences.
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Movie poster viewing distance (6-foot minimum) affects brushwork precision and detail hierarchy.
- **Commercial Production Authenticity:** 1960s-1980s lithographic printing methods take precedence over modern interpretations.
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; original Bond-style characters only.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Adults only; sophisticated evening wear emphasis.
- **Gender expression:** Respect McGinnis archetypes.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters; surface must exhibit authentic gouache characteristics with visible brush direction.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1960s-1980s offset lithography with 4-color process limitations, 150 LPI halftone screens, color registration drift ±0.5mm.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid anime drift, HDR smoothing, digital perfection, Instagram effects.
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

## Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Robert McGinnis movie poster gouache style** for **1960s-1980s commercial lithographic poster**.
- Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression following McGinnis archetype specifications.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original spy thriller characters avoiding copyrighted James Bond elements, use generic formal wear and evening gowns.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `gouache-opaque`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto-15-30-degrees`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** McGinnis commercial illustration techniques override photographic realism.
- **Mode Selector:** Movie poster with hierarchical star placement.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `2:3` (standard movie poster format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Strict recomposition for 2:3 format with hierarchical character placement
- **Spatial Allocation:** Primary figure 50-70% canvas height, positioned for hierarchical star billing; secondary characters at 20-30% scale in supporting positions
- **Background Treatment:** Predominantly clean white space with selective narrative elements positioned behind primary figures, occupying maximum 30% of canvas
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 ratio serves movie poster tradition with optimal lobby display proportions and text zone allocation

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Mid-century American commercial illustration, gouache tradition, pulp fiction aesthetics, James Bond poster legacy
- **Medium/Production method:** Gouache on illustration board with brush economy, transferred to 4-color offset lithography at 150 LPI, newsprint poster stock with 15% ink absorption
- **Thematic purpose:** Commercial movie marketing combining sophistication with mass appeal
- **Hallmark motifs:**
  - Male protagonist visual dominance in male-led films (largest scale, central positioning, forward placement)
  - Impossibly tall female supporting figures (8.5-head proportions) positioned around male leads
  - Selective background strategy: clean white space (70%) with strategic narrative vignettes behind figures (30% canvas maximum)
  - Saturated jewel tone palette for clothing against neutral backgrounds
  - Hard-edged commercial brush technique with crisp silhouettes
- **Period framing:** 1960s-1980s commercial illustration golden age
- **Tone Tag:** Sophisticated pulp glamour
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Pre-digital era commercial printing with characteristic color registration drift, visible halftone dots, and ink bleed limitations

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line quality:** Hard-edged gouache strokes with visible brush direction, no feathering, 2-3mm average stroke width
- **Color mixing methods:** Opaque layering technique, no transparent washes, pink flesh tone highlights over peach base (#FFCBA4 base + #FFB6C1 highlights)
- **Texture specifications:** Smooth gouache surface with 1mm paint thickness, brush texture visible in original but flattened in lithographic reproduction
- **Edge treatment:** Clean color separations with minimal blending, hard transitions between light and shadow planes
- **Stroke economy:** Maximum 3 strokes per flesh tone area, directional consistency following form structure
- **Color depth measurements:** 85% saturation for evening wear, 60% for casual clothing, 30% reflectivity on satin surfaces
- **Detail hierarchy:** Primary faces at 100% detail, secondary characters at 60% detail, background elements at 30% detail
- **Material simulation:** Gouache opacity characteristics with no transparency effects
- **Pose Anchors:** Female contrapposto with 15-30° weight shift, male figures with 90° shoulder alignment, direct eye contact at 0° deviation
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Female figures at 1.3:1 facial length-to-width ratio, male figures at 1.2:1 ratio, 25% oversized eyes for commercial appeal
- **Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic gouache brush marks with commercial illustration precision, no digital simulation
- **Period Consistency Anchor:** 1960s-1980s commercial art standards with lithographic printing limitations
- **Production Method Anchor:** 4-color process separation with ±0.5mm registration tolerance, 150 LPI screen patterns
- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** 2:3 movie poster composition with hierarchical star billing layout

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

- **Wardrobe tracks:** Adult sophisticated formal wear - tuxedos with black tie precision, evening gowns with period-accurate silhouettes (1960s A-line, 1970s halter, 1980s shoulder emphasis)

- **Fabric behavior:** Heavy satin drape at 45° fold angles, matte wool at 60° fold angles, period synthetic blend characteristics with limited stretch

- **Accessory caps:** Elaborate 3-4 items - diamond jewelry, formal watches, cigarette holders, champagne glasses

- **Color palette:** Evening wear at 85% saturation (emerald #50C878, sapphire #0F52BA, ruby #E0115F), formal wear in classic black/white with metallic accents

- **Wardrobe variation required:** Cycle through period-appropriate formal palette - no identical evening gown colors between female characters

- **Props:** 1 hero prop (weapon, cigarette holder, jewelry) + 1 micro atmospheric item (vehicle silhouette, architectural element) maximum

- **Coherence filter:** All elements support 1960s-1980s sophisticated thriller/romance; fallback = clean formal scene

- **YAML prop pools:**

  ```yaml
  hero_props: [golden_pistol, cigarette_holder, diamond_tiara, pearl_necklace, martini_glass, leather_gloves]luxury_items: [tiffany_jewelry_box, champagne_flute, silk_scarf, evening_purse]vehicles: [sports_car_silhouette, helicopter_outline, yacht_background, city_skyline]architectural: [skyscraper_outline, bridge_silhouette, casino_interior, hotel_balcony]
  ```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

- **Canvas Negatives (≥2):**
  - "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "unmodified framing"
  - "photographic realism", "digital smoothing", "modern poster design"
  - "watercolor transparency", "oil paint texture", "acrylic flatness"
  - "anime proportions", "manga styling", "cartoon simplification"
- **Canvas Positives (≥2):**
  - "exactly 2:3 ratio", "recomposed for movie poster format"
  - "gouache opacity with 1mm paint thickness", "brush direction visible in flesh tones"
  - "1960s-1980s lithographic printing with 150 LPI halftone screens"
  - "±0.5mm color registration drift authentic to period offset printing"
- **Vocabulary warnings:** Avoid "sophisticated," "professional," "quality" - use "commercial," "lithographic," "mass-market." Avoid "harmonious" - use "calculated commercial appeal."

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (2:3 Movie Poster):**

- Vertical emphasis with primary character dominating 70% of canvas height
- Hierarchical staging with star billing visual hierarchy
- Title treatment zone reserved in bottom 25% of composition

**MCGINNIS-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective regime:** Slight low-angle view (5-10° below eye level) for heroic presentation
- **Grid/symmetry:** Asymmetrical balance with primary figure offset to golden ratio position (38% from left edge)
- **Figure hierarchy:** Male protagonist dominance in male-led films through largest scale (40-50% canvas height), central positioning, or forward placement
- **Background Strategy:** Predominantly clean white space (70%) with selective narrative vignettes positioned behind primary figures, occupying maximum 30% of canvas
- **Lighting logic:** Single key light source from upper left (45° angle), creating consistent shadow patterns across all elements
- **Silhouette Treatment:** Hard-edged figure boundaries with crisp color separations, no atmospheric blending

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Commercial poster stock with 15% ink absorption characteristics, lobby display context
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely - no decorative borders outside canvas edge
- **Production Context Anchor:** 1960s-1980s offset lithography with period-appropriate color limitations and halftone visibility
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** All compositional elements designed specifically for 2:3 movie poster format with hierarchical star placement

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

- **Binary:** Allow text integration
- **Ratio-Appropriate Zones:** Movie poster layout optimized for 2:3 format with title treatment in bottom 25%, star billing in top 15%
- **Copy limits:** ≤3 words for title, ≤7 star names positioned for 2:3 ratio with hierarchical sizing
- **Period-Appropriate Typography:** 1960s-1980s movie poster typography with phototypesetting characteristics
- **Font recommendation:** Closest Google Font: Bebas Neue (Futura Bold Condensed analog, 80%). Better: Franklin Gothic Extra Condensed for title treatments
- **Format-Specific Text Rules:** Movie poster mode with mandatory title treatment, star billing hierarchy, and production credits in standard positions
- **Historical accuracy:** Typography must match 1960s-1980s movie poster conventions with period phototypesetting limitations
- **Production Method Integration:** Typography rendered with period offset lithography characteristics including slight ink spread and registration tolerance
