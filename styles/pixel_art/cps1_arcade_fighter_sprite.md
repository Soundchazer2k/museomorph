# Arcade Fighter Style (Street Fighter II / CPS-1) - Revised

## üîß Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** CPS-1 arcade hardware specs override home console limits
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Compose for 384√ó224 pixels (CPS-1 standard)
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** "4096 colors on-screen", "16√ó16 sprite tiles", "ROM budget paper-scissors method", "palette patching technique"
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Kit-of-parts sprite construction supersedes unified character rendering
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** `rom-budget-discipline`, `palette-patching`, `sprite-kit-assembly`
- **Face-Treatment Flags:** `dynamic-expression`, `anime-influenced-faces`, `athletic-proportions`
- **Pose Flags:** `dynamic-action`, `martial-stance`, `foreshortened-power`
- **Canvas Control Flags:** `format-native`
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Embrace athletic female proportions, avoid exaggerated musculature
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **384√ó224 pixels** - CPS-1 arcade standard
- Redraw in **arcade fighter sprite style** (Capcom CPS-1/SNK Neo Geo era, 1991-1999)
- Identity via dynamic martial arts pose with athletic proportions
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original fighter design avoiding Street Fighter, Fatal Fury, King of Fighters, Darkstalkers copyrighted characters and move sets
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `anime-influenced-faces`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `martial-stance`
- **Style Dominance:** CPS-1 sprite composition (16√ó16 tile assembly, high color count, ROM budget constraints) override simplified design
- **Mode Selector:** Fighter character select portrait or versus screen
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `384:224` (CPS-1 arcade resolution)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Large character sprite assembly from multiple 16√ó16 tiles
- **Spatial Allocation:** Character dominates frame (60-70%), lush detailed background (30-40%)
- **Background Treatment:** Rich parallax layers with detailed stage environments - reference Street Fighter Alpha, Darkstalkers, King of Fighters backgrounds
- **Format Justification:** Wide arcade resolution accommodates large fighter sprites with cinematic backgrounds
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Street Fighter II (1991), Street Fighter Alpha (1995), Darkstalkers (1994), Fatal Fury (1991), King of Fighters '94, Samurai Shodown (1993)
- **Medium/Production method:** Capcom CPS-1/CPS-2 or SNK Neo Geo arcade boards with "paper and scissors" ROM budget tracking
- **Thematic purpose:** Competitive arcade fighting game with instant character recognition and cinematic presentation
- **3-5 hallmark motifs:**
  - Athletic character sprites (48-96 pixels tall) with proportionate builds
  - 15-color sub-palettes per sprite segment allowing rich shading
  - Lush detailed backgrounds with multiple parallax layers (see Street Fighter Alpha stages)
  - Dynamic foreshortening and action poses
  - Palette patching for character variants (Ryu/Ken, Mai color swaps)
- **Period framing:** Golden age of arcade fighters (1991-1999), CPS-1/CPS-2/Neo Geo hardware
- **Tone Tag:** Dynamic, competitive, athletic, cinematic
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line quality:** Sharp pixel outlines with 1-2 pixel width for character definition
- **Color system:** 4096 colors on-screen (CPS-1), 15-color sub-palettes per sprite section
- **Body proportions:** Athletic builds - female fighters reference Mai Shiranui, Chun-Li, Morrigan (athletic, feminine, NOT overly muscular)
- **Material simulation:** Sprite tile assembly using kit-of-parts methodology, palette patching for variants
- **Scale measurements:** Character height 64-96 pixels, composed from 24-48 individual 16√ó16 tiles
- **Pose Anchors:** Martial arts stances with balanced weight distribution, dynamic but not extreme
- **Background rendering:** Lush multi-layer parallax with detailed environments - sunset skies, city streets, temple courtyards, forest stages
- **Production Method:** ROM budget tracking via physical paper boards, tile reuse maximization
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

- **Wardrobe tracks:**
  - **Female fighters:** Athletic wear, traditional martial arts uniforms, fantasy costumes (reference Mai Shiranui's traditional Japanese outfit, Chun-Li's qipao, Cammy's leotard, Morrigan's succubus outfit)
  - **Male fighters:** Martial arts gi, street fighter clothing, military gear, wrestling outfits
- **Fabric behavior:** Dynamic cloth physics implied through sprite animation, flowing scarves, capes, ribbons
- **Body types:**
  - **Female:** Athletic, proportionate, feminine builds - NOT bodybuilder physiques
  - **Male:** Muscular but varied (some lean like Ryu, some bulky like Zangief)
- **Accessory caps:** Moderate 2-3 items (headband, gloves, weapons, ornamental pieces)
- **Color palette:** Bold saturated colors with high contrast, vibrant costume designs
- **YAML prop pools:**

```yaml
fighter_gear_female:
  attire: [martial_arts_gi, traditional_outfit, athletic_bodysuit, fantasy_costume]
  accessories: [hair_ribbon, fans, gloves, ornamental_jewelry]
  weapons: [extendable_fans, kunai, chain_whip, magical_orbs]
  
fighter_gear_male:
  attire: [karate_gi, military_fatigues, wrestling_singlet, street_clothes]
  accessories: [headband, gloves, championship_belt, throwing_stars]
  weapons: [bo_staff, nunchaku, tonfa, chain]
```
## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**‚ùå Canvas Negatives:**

- "static pose"
- "limited colors"
- "small sprites"
- "simplified anatomy"
- "home console limitations"
- "overly muscular female characters"
- "bodybuilder physique"
- "plain backgrounds"
- "single layer backgrounds"
- "minimal environmental detail"

**‚úÖ Canvas Positives:**

- "exactly 384√ó224 pixels"
- "CPS-1 4096-color display"
- "16√ó16 tile kit construction"
- "dynamic martial arts pose"
- "athletic proportions"
- "feminine builds for female fighters"
- "lush detailed backgrounds"
- "multi-layer parallax environments"
- "sunset skies and detailed stages"

- **Lighting:** Dramatic directional lighting, sunset backlighting, stage spotlights
- **Figure:ground:** 60:40 or 70:30 character to background
- **Environmental storytelling:** Crowds, stage hazards, weather effects, time of day
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

- **Font recommendation:** Impact Label, Arcade Classic, SNK Neo Geo fonts, Capcom CPS-2 UI fonts
- **UI elements:**
  - Character name banners
  - Health bars with gradient fills
  - Timer display
  - Round counter
  - Special move notation (if applicable)
- **Character portraits:** Small avatar portraits in UI corners
- **Stage name display:** Brief stage identification

## Production Notes

### Body Type Guidelines

- **Female fighters:** Focus on athletic, agile builds appropriate to fighting style
- Avoid exaggerated musculature - reference actual female martial artists and dancers
- Maintain feminine proportions while showing athletic conditioning
- Different fighting styles suggest different body types (speedster vs. grappler)

### Background Art Priority

- Backgrounds should be as detailed and lush as character sprites
- Use full CPS-1/Neo Geo color capabilities for environmental richness
- Create depth through parallax layering (3-5 layers typical)
- Environmental storytelling through background details (crowds, weather, time of day)

### Animation Considerations

- Sprites designed for fluid animation (8-16 frames per action typical)
- Dynamic hair and clothing movement
- Special effects integration (fireballs, energy attacks, impact effects)
- Victory poses and taunts for personality
