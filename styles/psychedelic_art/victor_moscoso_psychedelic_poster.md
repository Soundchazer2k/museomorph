- Substrate: newsprint texture with ink absorption characteristics

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (concert poster standard) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

**COMPLETE ARTISTIC RECONSTRUCTION:** Redraw subject entirely from scratch as hand-crafted artwork in **Victor Moscoso's vibrant psychedelic poster style (1966-1971)**.

**CRITICAL: NO PHOTOGRAPHIC PRESERVATION.** This is not a photo filter or effect. Create original drawn artwork that captures essence through artistic interpretation, not photographic accuracy.

**Likeness Method**: Capture identity through **distinctive facial geometry, gesture, and expression** translated into Moscoso's drawing style with electric color relationships.

**Timeframe**: Peak San Francisco psychedelic poster period, Neon Rose series (1966-1971).

**Degree of artistic transformation**: Subject completely reimagined as hand-drawn psychedelic artwork; facial features, proportions, and forms genuinely stylized through Moscoso's artistic lens rather than photographically preserved.

**Emotional tone**: Electrically vibrant, visually intense, mind-expanding, colorfully explosive.

**Integration mandate**: Figure must organically dissolve into and emerge from psychedelic patterns - no subject sitting on top of decorative background.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original psychedelic portrait artwork avoiding copyrighted concert poster elements while maintaining authentic Moscoso hand-crafted aesthetic principles.

**Face-Treatment Flag**: `hand-drawn-psychedelic` **Pose Flag**: `organic-integration`
 **Canvas Control Flag**: `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance**: The final result must be hand-crafted psychedelic artwork emphasizing Moscoso's drawing aesthetic and electric color relationships over any photographic qualities.

**Mode Selector**: Hand-drawn concert poster format for psychedelic ballroom venues.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION**: `2:3` (classical poster format / 1960s concert poster standard)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method**: extend-background using electric color fields and organic patterns
- **Spatial Allocation**: Subject placement center-dominant with 70% figure dominance
- **Background Treatment**: Vibrant complementary color fields with flowing organic patterns creating continuous visual vibration
- **Format Justification**: 2:3 ratio serves psychedelic poster tradition, optimized for ballroom wall display and street-level visibility from distance

**Composition Adaptation**: Portrait orientation allows for vertical text integration while maximizing facial impact zone for color vibration effects.

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

The artwork must be created in Victor Moscoso's vibrant psychedelic poster style, capturing the **electric color theory and visual intensity** of 1960s San Francisco counterculture (1966-1971).

**Intended medium**: Photo-offset lithography with fluorescent inks and high-contrast color separations on newsprint substrate.

**Thematic purpose**: Concert poster and promotional materials for psychedelic rock shows; visual communication designed to capture attention from across the street while creating immersive viewing experience.

**Influences**: Bauhaus color theory (Josef Albers), Art Nouveau flowing forms, optical illusion art, mind-expanding visual experimentation, conscious inversion of academic design principles.

**3-5 hallmark motifs with quantified specifications**:

1. **Vibrating color edges**: Complementary colors (red/blue, orange/green) at equal value creating 2-3mm optical strain zones
2. **Illegible typography**: Letterforms bent and twisted, negative space drawing technique requiring 30+ seconds decoding time
3. **Xerox halftone dots**: Mechanical reproduction dots 3-5mm diameter visible from enlargement process
4. **Photo-collage layering**: 2-3 image layers with intentional registration drift 2-3mm offset
5. **Organic pattern integration**: Figure dissolves into decorative elements using continuous flowing lines

**Period framing**: Peak San Francisco psychedelic movement, Fillmore/Avalon ballroom poster era.

**Tone Tag**: Electrically challenging, visually aggressive, mind-expanding, deliberately irritating to conventional sensibilities.

**Production Era Authenticity**: 1960s photo-offset lithography limitations including halftone dot visibility, color registration issues, fluorescent ink bleeding on newsprint substrate.

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Work**: Hand-drawn flowing, organic contours using Moscoso's characteristic drawing technique; high-contrast edges between complementary color areas; 2-3mm line weight variations creating rhythm and flow; **no photographic edges or digital smoothing**.

**Anatomical Stylization**: Facial features and proportions genuinely reinterpreted through Moscoso's artistic lens; organic flowing interpretation of human form; 150% elongation or compression where artistically appropriate; **complete departure from photographic accuracy in favor of hand-crafted aesthetic**.

**Detail Hierarchy**: Hand-drawn details supporting electric color vibration effects; organic pattern details flowing seamlessly with figure; 60% figure integration/40% decorative pattern with **no separation between subject and background**.

**Coloring Method**: Electric complementary color combinations (red/green, blue/orange, yellow/purple) at equal value intensity; colors applied as hand-drawn fields rather than photographic tinting; fluorescent intensity simulation through pure color relationships; **no photographic color preservation**.

**Surface Quality**: **Hand-crafted drawing aesthetic** with organic line variation; authentic poster art surface treatment; **completely eliminate any photographic texture, grain, or smoothing**; emphasize drawn, artistic mark-making over mechanical reproduction effects.

**Figure-Ground Integration**: Subject organically emerges from and dissolves into psychedelic patterns; **no figure sitting on top of decorative background**; seamless integration through continuous line flow and color relationships.

**Pose Anchors**: Body and facial positioning emphasizing organic flow and pattern integration; gesture supporting overall composition rhythm; positioning optimized for hand-drawn artistic interpretation rather than photographic preservation.

**Scale Hierarchy**: Proportional relationships serving artistic composition; detail organized from primary (facial essence) to secondary (hair/clothing interpretation) to tertiary (integrated background patterns); **no photographic detail preservation**.

**Artistic Authenticity**: **Complete hand-drawn reconstruction** mimicking Moscoso's organic drawing technique and color application methods; **zero photographic characteristics retained**; authentic 1960s poster art aesthetic.

**Pattern Integration**: All elements flow together through Moscoso's characteristic organic line work; **figure and decorative elements unified through continuous artistic treatment** rather than layered separately.

**Canvas Adaptation**: Composition designed for 2:3 poster ratio with hand-drawn hierarchical organization optimized for artistic impact rather than photographic documentation.

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks**: 1960s counterculture fashion dissolved into color patterns and organic forms rather than realistic clothing representation.

**Typical clothing**: Figures often dissolve into color fields, with clothing indistinct or fully absorbed into swirling vibrating patterns; flowing tunics, bell-bottoms, peasant blouses transformed into pure color relationships.

**Fabric behavior**: Materials rendered as flowing color patterns rather than realistic textile representation; psychedelic transformation of conventional garments into electric color fields.

**Era-appropriate accessories**: Minimal focus on realistic accessories; love beads, peace symbols, round glasses integrated as color pattern elements rather than material objects.

**Color palette restrictions**: Electric complementary combinations only; no muted or earth tones; fluorescent intensity required; period accuracy through day-glo color simulation.

**Wardrobe variation required**: Primary garment colors cycle through electric complementary pairs - avoid repetition within same color family.

**Props**: 1 hero prop maximum (guitar, microphone, peace symbol) + optional 1 micro detail, total ≤2; all props dissolved into color pattern integration.

**Coherence filter**: All fashion elements support electric color vibration aesthetic; realistic material representation prohibited; fallback = pure color field integration.

**Detail level**: Stylized integration of clothing into overall color and pattern composition; electric color relationships prioritized over fashion accuracy.

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**Canvas Negatives (≥2)**:

- ⌐ No photographic realism or preservation—must be completely redrawn as hand-crafted artwork
- ⌐ No digital filters or effects applied to photographs—create original drawn artwork from scratch
- ⌐ No figure sitting on top of decorative background—must integrate organically through continuous artistic treatment
- ⌐ No photographic texture, grain, or smoothness—emphasize hand-drawn organic line work
- ⌐ No muted or subdued colors—must be electrically vibrant with complementary intensity
- ⌐ No realistic modeling or dimensional representation—flat poster art aesthetic with electric color relationships
- ⌐ No conservative or traditional color schemes—only electric complementary combinations
- ⌐ No original aspect ratio—must recompose for exact 2:3 poster proportion

**Canvas Positives (≥2)**:

- ✓ Exactly 2:3 ratio concert poster composition with hand-drawn hierarchical flow
- ✓ Complete artistic reconstruction using Moscoso's organic drawing aesthetic
- ✓ Electric complementary color relationships integrated throughout figure and pattern
- ✓ Hand-crafted poster art surface quality eliminating all photographic characteristics
- ✓ Organic figure-pattern integration where subject emerges from and dissolves into decorative elements
- ✓ Flowing, continuous line work unifying all compositional elements
- ✓ Authentic 1960s psychedelic poster drawing style and color application
- ✓ Illegible typography integration requiring sustained decoding effort through hand-lettered aesthetic

**Vocabulary warnings**: Avoid "harmonious," "pleasant," "comfortable," "easy to read," "conventional beauty"—these contradict Moscoso's rule-breaking methodology. Avoid "ornate" or "elaborate" if frame generation unwanted.

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**Ratio-Specific Composition Requirements**: Portrait 2:3 format with vertical emphasis, subject dominance ≥70%, hierarchical staging with concert poster conventions optimized for ballroom wall display and street visibility.

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION**:

**Perspective regime**: Flat poster perspective with optical depth achieved through color vibration rather than dimensional modeling; figure-ground ambiguity through complementary color adjacency.

**Grid/symmetry**: Organic asymmetrical composition with flowing integration of figure and decorative elements; rejection of academic grid systems.

**Figure:ground %**: 60% figure integration / 40% background pattern with deliberate boundary ambiguity through vibrating color edges.

**Density %**: High information density requiring sustained viewing; visual complexity preventing quick message transmission in direct contradiction to conventional poster principles.

**Lighting logic**: No naturalistic lighting; electric color relationships create illumination effects through complementary intensity rather than dimensional light sources.

**Detail:negative space ratio**: Minimal negative space; maximum visual engagement through continuous pattern flow and color vibration coverage optimized for 2:3 ratio.

**REQUIRED ANCHORS**:

**Surface Context Anchor**: Concert poster for psychedelic ballroom walls; newsprint substrate with photo-offset lithography characteristics; viewing distance 6-15 feet requiring high visual impact.

**Frame/Band Anchor**: No external frames or borders; composition bleeds to poster edges; integrated typography as part of overall design rather than separate text zones.

**Production Context Anchor**: 1960s San Francisco poster production methods; mechanical paste-up process with color separation techniques; intentional registration drift and halftone dot visibility.

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor**: Composition designed specifically for 2:3 poster proportion with vertical information hierarchy; figure placement optimized for poster format rather than adapted from different ratio.

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary Decision**: Allow typography integration (concert poster format requires band/venue information)

**Ratio-Appropriate Zones**: Typography integrated into flowing organic composition rather than separate text blocks; vertical hierarchy optimized for 2:3 poster proportion with reading pattern considerations.

**Copy limits**: ≤6 words per typographic element; ≤3 total text elements positioned for poster hierarchy with concert information priority.

**Period-Appropriate Typography**: Hand-lettered flowing letterforms integrated into decorative patterns; intentionally illegible aesthetic prioritizing visual impact over information transmission; difficult-to-read design requiring sustained decoding effort.

**Font recommendation**: Closest Google Font approximations for Moscoso's hand-lettered style:

- **Fredoka One** (rounded, flowing letterforms, 75% match)
- **Righteous** (1960s poster aesthetic, 70% match)
- **Bungee** (psychedelic poster letterforms, 80% match)
- Better historical accuracy: Hand-lettered custom typography following Moscoso's negative-space drawing technique

**Format-Specific Text Rules**: Concert poster mode with band name dominance, venue secondary, date tertiary; text becomes part of visual composition through color vibration integration rather than separate information blocks.

**Historical accuracy**: Typography must match 1966-1971 San Francisco psychedelic poster conventions with hand-lettered characteristics and deliberate illegibility aesthetic.

**Production Method Integration**: Typography rendered with same photo-offset lithography limitations including registration drift and halftone dot characteristics; color vibration applied to letterforms creating optical strain effects.

## Style Philosophy Integration

**Academic Rule Reversal System:**

1. **From Legible to Illegible**: Typography drawn in negative space, requiring active decoding
2. **From Harmony to Vibration**: Complementary colors at touching edges creating optical strain
3. **From Quick Reading to Extended Engagement**: Complex visual puzzles requiring 30+ seconds viewing time

**Moscoso's Innovation Principles:**

- "Reverse everything I learned" - systematic inversion of Bauhaus training
- "Hang somebody up in front of that poster for as long as you could"
- "Each edge was a vibrating edge" - comprehensive optical strain system
- Kinetic potential through color layer separation under stroboscopic lighting

This framework ensures authentic reproduction of Victor Moscoso's revolutionary psychedelic poster aesthetic while maintaining technical accuracy to his 1960s production methods and philosophical approach to rule-breaking design.
