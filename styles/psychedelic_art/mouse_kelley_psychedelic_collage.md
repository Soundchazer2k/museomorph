## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (concert poster standard) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

**COMPLETE ARTISTIC RECONSTRUCTION:** Redraw subject entirely from scratch as hand-crafted artwork in **Stanley Mouse & Alton Kelley's iconic psychedelic poster style (1966-1975)**.

**CRITICAL: NO PHOTOGRAPHIC PRESERVATION.** This is not a photo filter or effect. Create original drawn artwork that captures essence through iconic symbolic interpretation, not photographic accuracy.

**Likeness Method**: Capture identity through **iconic symbolism** combined with flowing Art Nouveau decorative elements, transforming subject into archetypal representation.

**Timeframe**: Peak Grateful Dead and San Francisco poster period, Family Dog productions (1966-1975).

**Degree of artistic transformation**: Subject completely reimagined as iconic, symbolic representation; emphasis on memorable visual impact through decorative integration rather than realistic portrayal.

**Emotional tone**: Mystically iconic, symbolically powerful, decoratively flowing, counterculturally rebellious.

**Integration mandate**: Figure must be decoratively framed and integrated with ornamental elements - iconic positioning within symbolic landscape rather than isolation.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original psychedelic portrait artwork avoiding copyrighted concert imagery while maintaining authentic Mouse & Kelley iconic symbolism and decorative integration principles.

**Face-Treatment Flag**: `iconic-symbolic-integration` **Pose Flag**: `archetypal-positioning`
 **Canvas Control Flag**: `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance**: The final result must be hand-crafted iconic poster art emphasizing symbolic power and Art Nouveau decorative integration over any photographic qualities.

**Mode Selector**: Iconic poster format for psychedelic rock venues emphasizing symbolic recognition and decorative beauty.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION**: `2:3` (classical poster format / 1960s concert poster standard)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method**: extend-background using Art Nouveau decorative patterns and symbolic landscape elements
- **Spatial Allocation**: Subject placement center-dominant with 65% figure dominance, 35% decorative framing integration
- **Background Treatment**: Flowing Art Nouveau patterns, symbolic landscapes, ornamental frameworks creating decorative context
- **Format Justification**: 2:3 ratio serves psychedelic poster tradition while accommodating decorative border elements and symbolic integration typical of Mouse & Kelley compositions

**Composition Adaptation**: Portrait orientation allows for vertical symbolic hierarchy with decorative framing elements while maximizing iconic impact of central figure.

------

5. **Ornamental typography**: Hand-lettered flowing text integrated into decorative scheme with 30-45 degree angle variations

**Period framing**: Peak San Francisco psychedelic movement, Family Dog and Grateful Dead poster era, historical art appropriation period.

**Tone Tag**: Mystically iconic, decoratively elegant, symbolically powerful, folk art influenced, historically conscious.

**Production Era Authenticity**: 1960s photo-offset lithography with split fountain techniques, hand-cut color separations, acetate overlay registration systems, custom ink mixing practices.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks**: 1960s counterculture fashion transformed into flowing decorative patterns and symbolic elements rather than realistic clothing representation.

**Typical clothing**: Figures may appear in historic, mythic, or allegorical costume rather than contemporary fashion, reinforcing their iconic symbolic significance; flowing robes, period dress, archetypal garments.

**Era-appropriate accessories**: Peace symbols, cosmic elements, folk art jewelry integrated into overall decorative scheme; symbolic rather than realistic representation; accessories supporting archetypal transformation.

**Fabric qualities**: Materials rendered as flowing decorative patterns following Art Nouveau textile treatment; clothing transformed into symbolic costume elements rather than realistic garments.

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**Canvas Negatives (≥2)**:

- ⌐ No photographic realism or preservation—must be completely redrawn as iconic symbolic artwork
- ⌐ No digital filters or effects applied to photographs—create original iconic art from historical appropriation approach
- ⌐ No harsh optical vibration or electric color combinations—must use harmonious Art Nouveau color relationships
- ⌐ No figure isolation without decorative context—must integrate with ornamental framework and symbolic landscape
- ⌐ No photographic texture, grain, or smoothness—emphasize hand-drawn decorative poster art line quality
- ⌐ No chaotic or uncontrolled compositions—must maintain Art Nouveau decorative flow and iconic clarity
- ⌐ No aggressive or confrontational imagery—must maintain folk art warmth and symbolic dignity
- ⌐ No original aspect ratio—must recompose for exact 2:3 poster proportion with decorative framing

**Canvas Positives (≥2)**:

- ✓ Exactly 2:3 ratio concert poster composition with decorative hierarchical flow and ornamental framing
- ✓ Complete iconic symbolic reconstruction using Mouse & Kelley's archetypal transformation approach
- ✓ Art Nouveau decorative integration with flowing ornamental patterns and symbolic landscape elements
- ✓ Split fountain rainbow color effects creating smooth harmonic transitions between 3-4 hues
- ✓ Hand-crafted poster art surface quality eliminating all photographic characteristics in favor of iconic symbolic treatment
- ✓ Historical appropriation aesthetic referencing 19th-century illustration traditions with contemporary recontextualization
- ✓ Symbolic landscape integration where subject occupies archetypal position within decorative environmental context
- ✓ Ornamental typography integration with hand-lettered flowing text becoming part of overall decorative scheme

**Vocabulary warnings**: Avoid "harsh," "aggressive," "confrontational," "chaotic," "electric vibration" - these contradict Mouse & Kelley's harmonious folk art influenced aesthetic. Avoid "ornate" or "elaborate" only if frame generation unwanted, though decorative integration is essential to their style.
