## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (concert poster standard) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

**COMPLETE ARTISTIC RECONSTRUCTION:** Redraw subject entirely from scratch as hand-crafted artwork in **Wes Wilson's flowing psychedelic poster style (1966-1968)**.

**CRITICAL: NO PHOTOGRAPHIC PRESERVATION OR FILTERING.** Face and features must be completely redrawn with Wilson's characteristic flowing organic contours defining all shapes. Subject rendered with flowing graphic treatment using organic line work and Wilson's authentic 3-4 color palette plus black.

**Likeness Method**: Capture identity through **flowing organic poster treatment** - subject recognition through Wilson's organic integration and flowing movement rather than realistic representation.

**Timeframe**: Foundational San Francisco psychedelic poster period, Wilson's peak innovation years (1966-1968).

**Degree of artistic transformation**: Subject completely reimagined as fluidly stylized artwork; emphasis on organic integration and flowing movement over realistic representation.

**Emotional tone**: Organically flowing, psychedelically integrated, naturally trippy, fluidly harmonious, sensually expressive.

**Integration mandate**: Figure must flow seamlessly with Wilson's characteristic organic patterns and undulating elements creating unified composition.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original psychedelic portrait artwork avoiding copyrighted concert imagery while maintaining authentic Wilson flowing organic integration and Art Nouveau-inspired sensuous aesthetics.

**Face-Treatment Flag**: `organic-flow-integration`
**Pose Flag**: `organic-flowing-positioning`  
**Canvas Control Flag**: `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance**: The final result must be hand-crafted flowing psychedelic artwork emphasizing Wilson's organic integration and seamless pattern unity over any photographic qualities.

**Mode Selector**: Flowing poster format for psychedelic ballrooms emphasizing organic integration and sensuous Art Nouveau-inspired aesthetics.

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION**: `2:3` (classical poster format / 1960s concert poster standard)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method**: extend-background using Wilson's flowing organic patterns and undulating elements
- **Spatial Allocation**: Subject placement flowing organically throughout composition with 65% figure integration, 35% pattern flow
- **Background Treatment**: Seamless flowing organic patterns, undulating elements, continuous pattern integration creating unified flowing composition
- **Format Justification**: 2:3 ratio serves psychedelic poster tradition while accommodating Wilson's flowing pattern integration and organic compositional unity

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making (≥5 anchors + measurement specifications)

**Line Work**: Bold black outline work (2-3mm thick) defining all major forms; clear contour lines separating color areas; eliminate photographic line characteristics and soft edges throughout composition.

**Anatomical Stylization**: Flat graphic shapes with 2-3mm black outlines; eliminate all photographic proportions and dimensional modeling; replace realistic features with simplified graphic elements; bold outline work as primary structural element.

**Detail Hierarchy**: Primary elements defined by 2-3mm black outlines; secondary elements as flat color areas within outlines; tertiary elements as pattern shapes; eliminate realistic detail rendering in favor of graphic simplification.

**Coloring Method**: Wilson's authentic palette - **maximum 3 colors total** (one light, one dark/black, one accent); flat color areas separated by black outline work; eliminate color blending and photographic shading; each color occupies distinct areas defined by 2-3mm black boundaries.

**Surface Quality**: Bold graphic aesthetic with flat color areas separated by 2-3mm black outline work; **3 colors total maximum** creating Wilson's characteristic restrained approach; distinct color zones with black boundaries; eliminate all photographic surface treatments.

**Figure-Ground Integration**: Subject rendered as bold outlined forms (2-3mm black lines) positioned within undulating background patterns; clear separation between outlined figure and pattern areas; background patterns do not blend into figure areas.

**Pose Anchors**: Body positioning defined through bold graphic outline work (2-3mm black lines); eliminate photographic gesture treatment; position optimized for clear graphic poster composition with black outline definition.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor**: Proportional relationships serving flowing organic composition; seamless integration organization rather than realistic detail hierarchy; organic flow emphasized.

**Material Authenticity Anchor**: Authentic 1960s photo-offset lithography techniques; split fountain color gradation methods; flowing organic line work with period-appropriate characteristics.

**Period Consistency Anchor**: All elements historically coherent with Wilson's 1966-1968 poster innovations; authentic organic integration methods; documented flowing pattern techniques.

**Production Method Anchor**: Photo-offset lithography with split fountain technique; acetate overlay color separations; flowing organic line work production methods.

**Font recommendation**: Flowing letterforms for Wilson's organic integration style:

- **Fredoka One** (organic flowing letterforms, 75% match)
- **Righteous** (1960s poster aesthetic with flow, 70% match) 
- **Bungee** (psychedelic poster letterforms, 80% match)
- Better historical accuracy: Hand-lettered melting typography following Wilson's Alfred Roller adaptation with organic warping

**Format-Specific Text Rules**: Psychedelic poster mode with flowing text hierarchy; text becomes part of organic compositional flow through Wilson's seamless integration principles.

**Historical accuracy**: Typography must match 1966-1968 San Francisco psychedelic poster conventions with Wilson's melting letterform innovation and flowing organic integration.
