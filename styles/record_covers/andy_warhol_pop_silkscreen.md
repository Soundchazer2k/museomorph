about: >
  Andy Warhol treated album covers as pop multiples‚Äîsilkscreened portraits,
  saturated product shots, and cheeky interactive gimmicks. His compositions
  rely on flat color fields, bold outlines, and Factory-style studio
  photography. We echo that celebrity pop vernacular while inventing new motifs
  and steering clear of licensed stars.

# Andy Warhol ‚Äî Pop Art Silkscreen Iconography

## üîß Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Face-Treatment Flags:** `silkscreen-layered`, `four-color-process`, `registration-drift`, `halftone-newsprint`

**Pose Flags:** `frontal-rigid`, `power-stance`, `geometric-faceted`

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Media Hybrid Flag:** `vector-screenprint` (photographic source reduced to flat silkscreen)

**Material Physics Authority:** Photo-silkscreen process with light-sensitive emulsion on silk mesh screens, acrylic-based inks applied with rubber squeegee, intentional misregistration as aesthetic element.

**Period Production Authenticity:** 1964-1987 Factory era production methods, high-contrast photographic reduction, multiple color layer registration, embrace of mechanical reproduction imperfections.

------
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **1:1 ratio** (album cover standard) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Redraw subject in **Andy Warhol's Pop Art silkscreen style** for **vinyl LP album cover (12" √ó 12")**.

Identity via **bold graphic reduction to flat iconic shapes** - subject becomes simplified high-contrast image with sharp color blocking. Features reduced to essential geometric shapes with dramatic color separation.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original pop art portraits avoiding reproduction of Warhol's celebrity series while maintaining silkscreen aesthetic and color blocking methodology.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `silkscreen-layered` with `registration-drift`

**Pose Flag:** `frontal-rigid` (passport/mugshot positioning)

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance:** Flat graphic silkscreen aesthetic and commercial reproduction override photographic realism.

**Mode Selector:** Album cover (vinyl LP format)

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `1:1` (album cover standard)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe (tight cropping to shoulders/chest, centered)
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject dominates 80-95% of frame, minimal background space
- **Background Treatment:** Pure flat color field (single solid color, no gradients)
- **Format Justification:** Square format enables centered frontal portrait, symmetrical color blocking, repetition grids (when multiple portraits)

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Commercial advertising, celebrity photography, mass production aesthetics, consumer product packaging.

**Medium/Production Method:** Photo-silkscreen printing - light-sensitive emulsion applied to silk mesh screens, film positives exposed creating blocked areas, acrylic inks pushed through screens using rubber squeegee. Process creates flat color blocks with sharp edges, intentional misregistration between layers embraced as Factory aesthetic. High-contrast photographic negatives reduce subjects to bold graphic shapes.

**Thematic Purpose:** Collapse boundaries between fine art and commerce, treat celebrity/subject as consumer product, explore mechanical reproduction and seriality, deadpan ironic commentary on fame.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **High-contrast reduction** (subjects flattened to 3-4 value zones)
2. **Bold color blocking** (hot pink, acid yellow, cyan, magenta, electric blue)
3. **Repetition grids** (same image repeated with color variations)
4. **Commercial aesthetics** (packaging-like presentation)
5. **Deliberate imperfection** (registration drift, uneven ink coverage)

**Period Framing:** 1964-1987 Factory era, peak Pop Art album cover production.

**Tone Tag:** Deadpan, ironic, commercially cool, celebrity-obsessed, mechanically detached.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Factory silkscreen process with characteristic ink variations, registration shifts, embrace of mechanical reproduction "flaws" as artistic elements.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line work:** Single strong contour outlines OR no outlines (color blocks meet at sharp edges). Photographic reduction to pure black/white creates edge definition.

**Color:** Strictly 3-4 ultra-saturated colors - hot pink (#FF69B4), acid yellow (#FFFF00), cyan (#00FFFF), magenta (#FF00FF), electric blue (#0000FF), deep black (#000000). Day-glo, fluorescent quality to pigments.

**Texture:** Perfectly flat silkscreen ink coverage, slight screen mesh texture (200-305 threads per inch), minimal variation. Acrylic inks create matte or semi-gloss surface depending on formulation.

**Edge treatment:** Sharp photographic edges where colors meet, slight registration drift (0.5-2mm offset) between color layers creating characteristic Warhol "mistake" aesthetic.

**Detail reduction:** Eyes, nose, mouth simplified to flat contrasting shapes. Hair becomes solid color mass. Skin flattened to 2-3 tonal zones. No gradients or modeling.

**Pose Anchors:** Centered frontal positioning, head/shoulders cropped tight at chest level, 0¬∞ head tilt, direct frontal gaze or slight 15¬∞ angle, symmetrical composition.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Subject fills 80-95% of canvas, face occupies 60-70% of total area, features reduced to essential geometric zones.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic silkscreen ink flatness, no painterly blending. Mesh pattern barely visible in solid color areas. Acrylic ink sits on surface rather than absorbing into paper.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** Factory production methods require manual screen registration creating characteristic slight shifts between color layers. Embrace imperfection as authentic element.

**Production Method Anchor:** Each color requires separate screen - 3-4 screens minimum. Registration marks trimmed in final production. Inks mixed to exact color specifications, applied in sequence (typically dark to light or light to dark).

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Square 1:1 format perfect for centered portrait, enables repetition grids when using serial imagery approach.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks:**

- **Generic 1960s-70s:** Plain T-shirts, collared shirts, mod jackets
- **Simplified rendering:** Clothing flattened to solid color blocks
- **Focus on face:** Minimal clothing detail, often cropped at chest

**Fabric Behavior:** All texture eliminated - clothing becomes flat color zones. No drape, wrinkle, or material indication.

**Accessory Caps:** Minimalist 0-1 (sunglasses occasionally, otherwise avoid distracting details)

**Color Palette:** Clothing colors chosen for graphic contrast - never realistic skin/clothing tones. Bold contrasts between face, hair, clothing, background.

**Props (YAML Pool):**

```yaml
warhol_pop_props:
  iconic_objects:
    - consumer_products: [banana, soup_can_silhouette, bottle_shape]
    - celebrity_items: [sunglasses, microphone, camera]
  color_combinations:
    - hot_palette: [hot_pink, acid_yellow, electric_blue]
    - cool_palette: [cyan, magenta, lime_green]
    - classic_warhol: [orange, turquoise, purple, black]
  repetition_patterns:
    - grid_layouts: [2x2, 3x3, single_large]
    - color_variations: [same_image_different_colors]
```

**Coherence Filter:** All elements must support flat graphic pop aesthetic. Default = clean frontal portrait with bold color blocking.

------
## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**‚ùå Canvas Negatives:**

- "photorealistic rendering"
- "soft gradients"
- "painterly brushwork"
- "subtle shading"
- "naturalistic colors"
- "detailed background"
- "ornate decoration"
- "hand-drawn quality"
- "textured surfaces"
- "atmospheric depth"

**‚úÖ Canvas Positives:**

- "exactly 1:1 square ratio"
- "flat silkscreen ink coverage"
- "3-4 ultra-saturated colors maximum"
- "high-contrast photographic reduction"
- "registration drift 0.5-2mm offset"
- "pure flat background color field"
- "frontal centered portrait crop"
- "acrylic ink matte surface"
- "mesh screen 200-305 TPI texture"
- "factory mechanical reproduction aesthetic"

**Vocabulary Warnings:** Avoid "subtle," "nuanced," "atmospheric," "organic," "hand-crafted." Embrace "flat," "mechanical," "commercial," "graphic," "iconic."

------
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (1:1 Square):**

- Centered frontal portrait dominates
- Subject fills frame edge-to-edge or with minimal margin
- Symmetrical balance through centered positioning
- Optional repetition grid (2x2, 3x3 variations)

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Framing:** Tight crop at chest/shoulders, face fills majority of frame
- **Figure:Ground:** 90:10 ratio (subject dominates, minimal background)
- **Density:** High-impact through bold color contrast, minimal negative space
- **Lighting Logic:** Flat frontal illumination eliminating shadows, reducing to 3-4 tonal zones
- **Detail:Negative Space:** 85:15 ratio (graphic impact through minimal void)

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:** Vinyl LP album sleeve, offset lithography reproducing silkscreen aesthetic, coated stock for flat ink coverage appearance.

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT entirely - pure flat background color field extends to edges. No decorative borders.

**Production Context Anchor:** Silkscreen simulation through offset lithography, 4-color process printing attempting to match Factory silkscreen ink saturation, flat ink coverage without gradients.

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Perfect square enables centered symmetrical portraits, repetition grids when using serial approach.

------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** MINIMAL (Warhol often avoided text on front covers)

**Ratio-Appropriate Zones:**

- Small corner placement when present (5-10% of canvas)
- Bottom edge minimal text
- Typography secondary to image
- Often completely absent from front

**Copy Limits:**

- Front cover: 0-3 words maximum
- Band name small if included
- Title often omitted from front

**Period-Appropriate Typography:**

- **Primary fonts:** Helvetica, Futura, Times New Roman (standard commercial fonts)
- **Size range:** 10-16pt when present (deliberately understated)
- **Placement:** Corner or edge, never interfering with portrait

**Font Recommendations:**

- **Google Font:** Montserrat or Poppins (85% match for Helvetica)
- **Better Match:** Helvetica, Futura Bold, Times New Roman

**Format-Specific Rules (Album Cover):**

- Front cover typically image-only or minimal text
- Typography subordinate to visual impact
- Commercial font choices matching consumer product packaging
- Text placed asymmetrically in corner or along edge

**Historical Accuracy:** Standard commercial typography of 1960s-80s, phototypesetting or early digital, minimal integration with silkscreen imagery.

**Production Method Integration:** Typography printed as separate layer in offset lithography, typically black or single color matching silkscreen color palette.
