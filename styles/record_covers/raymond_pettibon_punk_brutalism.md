# Raymond Pettibon ‚Äî Punk Comic Book Brutalism

## üîß Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Face-Treatment Flags:** `pen-crosshatch`, `brush-wash`, `xerox-reproduction`, `linear-anatomical-destruction`

**Pose Flags:** `contorted-psychological`, `aesthetic-rebellion-required`, `comfort-violation-authorized`

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Media Hybrid Flag:** N/A (India ink only)

**Material Physics Authority:** India ink on paper with traditional brush application, economy of means technique emphasizing transparent process, xerox reproduction for mass distribution, crude offset lithography from ink originals.

**Period Production Authenticity:** 1980s SST Records/Black Flag era, underground comix influence, lo-fi reproduction embraced as authentic punk aesthetic.

------
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **1:1 ratio** (album cover standard) OR **7:7** (vinyl single) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Redraw subject in **Raymond Pettibon's punk brush-and-ink caricature style** for **SST Records album cover**.

**MANDATORY DISTORTION:** Subject face must never remain intact. Eyes, mouth, or forehead must be partially obscured, warped, or overwritten with text, ink splatters, or heavy shadows. Expression hostile, sneering, unnerving - **absolutely no smiles**.

Identity recognizable only enough to identify, but **distorted, hostile, and defaced** through crude ink work, aggressive cross-hatching, deliberate uglification.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original punk confrontations avoiding reproduction of specific Black Flag/SST imagery while maintaining hostile ink aesthetic and text-overlay methodology.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` with `linear-anatomical-destruction`

**Pose Flag:** `contorted-psychological` with `comfort-violation-authorized`

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance:** Hostile ink distortion and text assault override aesthetic appeal.

**Mode Selector:** Album cover (vinyl LP or single format)

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `1:1` (album cover standard)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe (aggressive cropping, hostile framing)
- **Spatial Allocation:** Distorted portrait (40-60%), aggressive text overlays (30-50%), ink splatter and scribbles (20-30%)
- **Background Treatment:** Stark white or flat single-color fields layered with scrawled doodles and splatters
- **Format Justification:** Square format enables centered assault target, text cutting across all angles, balanced confrontational composition

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Underground comix (R. Crumb, S. Clay Wilson), LA punk flyers, Black Flag/SST Records aesthetic, political cartooning, horror comic book brutality.

**Medium/Production Method:** India ink with brush creating thick scratchy strokes, jagged cross-hatching, uneven outlines. Economy of means - transparent technique without calling attention to method ("I'm not interested in virtuosity"). Xerox reproduction creating characteristic grain and contrast blow-out. Text integration through scratchy hand-lettering cutting across imagery.

**Thematic Purpose:** Anarchic satire, blunt social commentary, punk agitprop, aesthetic assault on conventional beauty, confrontational visual violence.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Hostile expressions** (sneering, aggressive, psychologically disturbed)
2. **Warped anatomy** (distorted features, exaggerated ugliness)
3. **Text assault** (words cutting through faces, aggressive messaging)
4. **Ink violence** (splatters, scratches, brutal mark-making)
5. **Deliberate uglification** (anti-beauty aesthetic mandate)

**Period Framing:** 1980s hardcore punk/SST Records era, peak underground comix influence.

**Tone Tag:** Hostile, confrontational, satirical, psychologically disturbing, aggressively crude.

**Production Era Authenticity:** DIY punk reproduction - xerox grain embraced, crude offset printing, lo-fi aesthetic as political statement.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Brush technique:** Thick scratchy India ink strokes, irregular line weight, deliberate crudeness. No smooth vector precision - embrace wobbling hand-drawn brutality.

**Cross-hatching:** Jagged aggressive hatching creating blocky shadows. Uneven spacing, violent directional changes, crude shading technique.

**Line quality:** Thick outlines with bleeding edges, broken contours, scratchy texture. Brush occasionally running dry creating spattered marks.

**Color:** Primarily black/white. Occasional flat blotches of misregistered red, yellow, or blue when color used. No gradients or subtle toning.

**Texture:** Xerox grain, ink bleed, paper texture visible. Deliberate messy scribbles, splatter marks, random scratches.

**Distortion requirements:** Eyes warped or obscured by shadows, mouth twisted into hostile sneer, forehead cut by text overlays. Features deliberately uglified - no conventional attractiveness permitted.

**Expression mandate:** Hostile, sneering, unnerving, psychologically disturbed. **Absolutely no smiles or pleasant expressions.**

**Pose Anchors:** Contorted positioning suggesting psychological disturbance, aggressive forward lean, confrontational body language when visible.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Face dominates (50-70%), text overlays aggressive (30-50%), background minimal stark field (10-20%).

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic India ink bleeding and pooling characteristics, brush stroke variations, paper texture affecting ink absorption, xerox reproduction grain.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** 1980s punk production limitations - crude offset printing, xerox masters, lo-fi reproduction embraced as authentic.

**Production Method Anchor:** Xerox reproduction from ink originals OR crude offset lithography creating characteristic grain, contrast blow-out, edge bleeding.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Square format enables centered hostile portrait, text cutting diagonally across all angles, balanced confrontational assault.

------
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks:**

- **Punk regalia:** Leather jackets, graphic t-shirts reduced to crude outline forms
- **Basic clothing:** Plain shirts, jackets rendered as scratchy ink shapes
- **Often minimal:** Clothing subordinate to facial assault

**Fabric Behavior:** All texture eliminated - clothing becomes scratchy ink outlines or solid black masses.

**Accessory Caps:** Minimalist 0-1 (occasionally cigarettes, bottles as crude props)

**Color Palette:** Black ink dominant, occasional flat red or yellow when color printing available.

**Props (YAML Pool):**

```yaml
raymond_pettibon_props:
  hostile_elements:
    - facial_distortions: [warped_eyes, twisted_mouth, shadowed_features]
    - text_assaults: [words_across_face, aggressive_slogans, satirical_captions]
  ink_violence:
    - mark_making: [ink_splatters, scratchy_scribbles, bleeding_edges]
    - cross_hatching: [aggressive_shadows, jagged_shading, violent_directional_marks]
  punk_symbols:
    - crude_objects: [bottles, cigarettes, weapons_outlined]
    - political_imagery: [flags_defaced, authority_mocked, social_satire]
```

**Coherence Filter:** All elements support hostile confrontational aesthetic. Default = distorted hostile portrait with aggressive text overlay.

- "pleasant smiling expression"
- "polished illustration"
- "smooth vector graphics"
- "conventional beauty"
- "refined craftsmanship"
- "digital precision"
- "harmonious composition"
- "commercial appeal"
- "aesthetic pleasure"

**‚úÖ Canvas Positives:**

**Vocabulary Warnings:** Avoid "pleasant," "attractive," "refined," "polished," "beautiful." Embrace "hostile," "crude," "brutal," "confrontational," "ugly."

------
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (1:1 Square):**

- Centered hostile portrait assault
- Text cutting diagonally across all angles
- Crude unbalanced layout feeling urgent
- Aggressive mark-making extending to edges

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Layout:** Deliberately unbalanced, crude, confrontational
- **Figure:Ground:** 70:30 ratio (portrait dominates with minimal background)
- **Density:** High aggression (layered hostile elements, text overlays, ink violence)
- **Lighting Logic:** Harsh contrast creating brutal shadows
- **Detail:Negative Space:** 80:20 ratio (maximum visual assault)

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:** Vinyl LP or single sleeve, xerox reproduction or crude offset printing, cheap paper stock, lo-fi punk aesthetic.

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT decorative frames. Composition extends chaotically, deliberately uncontained.

**Production Context Anchor:** Xerox reproduction from ink originals OR crude offset lithography creating characteristic grain, contrast blow-out, ink bleed.

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Square format creates centered assault target, enables text placement cutting across all angles.

------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** ESSENTIAL (typography as hostile weapon)

**Ratio-Appropriate Zones:**

- Hand-scrawled text cutting across forehead, shirt, neck, face diagonally
- Words positioned intrusively and violently
- Never neat captions or centered titles
- Text obscures and assaults portrait

**Copy Limits:**

- Aggressive slogans/satirical captions (5-15 words)
- Band/album info minimal and crude
- Typography occupies 30-50% of composition

**Period-Appropriate Typography:**

- **Hand-scrawled aesthetic:** Scratchy uneven lettering
- **Degraded approximations:** TrashHand, Punk's Not Dead font references
- **Always messy:** Never clean digital typography

**Slogan Pool (randomize 2 per image):** "NO FUTURE", "THE SYSTEM IS A LIE", "TOO MANY HUMANS", "CHAOS", "KILL YOUR TV", "HUMAN WASTE", "TRUST NO ONE"

**Format-Specific Rules (Album Cover):**

- Typography intrusive across face/body
- Placement diagonal, violent, confrontational
- Never respectful positioning
- Hand-scrawled crude execution

**Historical Accuracy:** All text hand-drawn with brush or pen, deliberately crude and aggressive, xerox-reproduced maintaining scratchy characteristics.

**Production Method Integration:** Typography rendered as India ink hand-lettering, reproduced through xerox or crude offset maintaining scratchy hostile characteristics.
