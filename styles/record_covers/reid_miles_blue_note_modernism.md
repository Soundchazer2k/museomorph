about: >
  Reid Miles distilled Francis Wolff‚Äôs rehearsal photos into duotone blocks,
  letting rotated sans-serif type swing like a solo. His Blue Note covers are
  crisp, cool, and math-driven yet still intimate to the musicians. MuseoMorph
  keeps that modular rhythm while composing fresh titles and avoiding recycled
  catalog numerals.

# Reid Miles ‚Äî Blue Note Records Hard Bop Modernism

## üîß Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Face-Treatment Flags:** `halftone-dot`, `offset-dot`, `silver-halide-grain`, `contact-print-scale`

**Pose Flags:** `candid-motion`, `frontal-rigid`, `psychological-tension`

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Media Hybrid Flag:** `photo-illustration-collage` (photographic portraits integrated with bold typography)

**Material Physics Authority:** Hot-metal typesetting (Intertype line-casting), duotone photography, offset lithography with specialized jazz blue and greenish-tint inks, high-quality paperstock preventing bleed.

**Period Production Authenticity:** 1955-1967 Blue Note golden era, phototypesetting transition, precise color separation for two-tone printing, modular grid systems.

------
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **1:1 ratio** (album cover standard) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Redraw subject in **Reid Miles' Blue Note modernist album cover style** for **vinyl LP jazz album (12" √ó 12")**.

Identity via **high-contrast photography reduced to graphic elements** - subject becomes bold geometric form integrated into modular typographic layout. Subject appears as cropped portrait, candid musician stance, or abstracted silhouette.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original jazz-inspired photographic compositions avoiding reproduction of specific Blue Note catalog designs while maintaining methodological authenticity.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `halftone-dot` with `offset-dot` characteristics

**Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` or `frontal-rigid` (jazz musician stances)

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance:** Modular grid systems and bold typography override photographic realism.

**Mode Selector:** Album cover (vinyl LP format)

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `1:1` (album cover standard)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe (tight cropping into modular blocks)
- **Spatial Allocation:** Photography occupies 40-60% of composition, typography fills remaining space in bold geometric blocks
- **Background Treatment:** Solid color fields (blues, blacks, oranges, greens) OR duotone photographic backgrounds
- **Format Justification:** Square format enables perfect modular division, rotated typography, mathematical grid precision

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Bauhaus, Swiss Modernism, European poster design, American abstract expressionism, jazz improvisation translated to visual rhythm.

**Medium/Production Method:** High-contrast photography by Francis Wolff, reduced to duotone or spot color. Hot-metal typesetting using Intertype line-casting machines (pre-1966) then Linotype Spartan (post-1966). Offset lithography with specialized inks (greenish-tint, reflex blue). Typography manipulated as visual element - fragmented, stacked, rotated, enlarged/reduced asymmetrically.

**Thematic Purpose:** Build consistent Blue Note brand identity through sophisticated modernist design, elevate jazz packaging to high art, create visual rhythm paralleling musical improvisation.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Bold typography** as dominant visual element (often larger than photography)
2. **Tight cropping** of musician portraits (eyes, instruments, hands)
3. **Duotone colorization** (black + single accent color)
4. **Rotated compositions** (45¬∞ angles, tilted frames)
5. **Heavy negative space** used rhythmically

**Period Framing:** 1955-1967 Blue Note golden age, peak modernist jazz design era.

**Tone Tag:** Cool, sophisticated, urban, rhythmic, intellectually accessible.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Hot-metal typesetting (1955-1966) creating distinct letterform characteristics, transition to phototypesetting (1966-1967) with Linotype Spartan fonts. Offset lithography with precise color registration, specialized Blue Note ink formulations.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Photography specifications:** Contax or Leica 35mm cameras (Francis Wolff), Kodak Tri-X 400 film, high-contrast printing to eliminate mid-tones. Tight cropping isolating facial features, instruments, hands in extreme close-up.

**Film/Grain:** Kodak Tri-X pushed to high contrast, visible grain structure at print scale, deliberate loss of shadow/highlight detail for graphic impact.

**Line work:** Sharp photographic edges combined with bold typographic outlines. Letterforms treated as geometric shapes with crisp vector precision.

**Color:** Restricted palettes - black + single accent color. Blues (#003366 reflex blue, #4169E1 royal blue), oranges (#FF8C00), greens (#228B22 greenish-tint), occasional reds. Duotone printing technique overlays photography with colored halftone screens.

**Texture:** Smooth offset lithography on quality paperstock. Halftone dot structure visible (120-133 LPI screen frequency). High-quality paper prevents ink bleeding, maintains sharp edges.

**Typography manipulation:** Letters fragmented, stacked vertically, rotated 45-90¬∞, enlarged to massive scale, shrunk to tiny accents. Sans-serif fonts (Haas Inserat-Grotesk, Ultra Bodoni, Clarendon) treated as modular building blocks.

**Pose Anchors:** Musicians photographed candidly - head tilted examining instrument, fingers on keys, contemplative expressions. When frontal, direct eye contact with camera creating psychological intensity.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Typography often dominates at 200-400% size of photography. Musician portraits occupy 30-50% of canvas, typography fills remaining space aggressively.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic offset lithography halftone patterns, hot-metal typesetting imperfections (slight variations in letter spacing, baseline shifts). Ink density variations characteristic of 1960s printing.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** Pre-1966 Intertype typesetting creates subtle irregularities. Post-1966 Linotype Spartan shows distinctive horizontal serifs on numeral "1". Photography always high-contrast black/white or duotone, never full-color.

**Production Method Anchor:** Standard 2-color offset printing (black + spot color) OR 3-color (black + two accents). Registration tolerance ¬±1mm acceptable, creating characteristic slight color shifts. Specialized Blue Note inks mixed to exact formulations.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Square format exploited through rotated compositions, diagonal typography cutting across quadrants, modular grid divisions creating visual rhythm.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks:**

- **Jazz musicians:** Suits, ties, shirtsleeves, suspenders, fedoras, porkpie hats
- **Casual sessions:** Button-down shirts, sweaters, casual 1950s-60s attire
- **Focus on instruments:** Clothing often cropped out of tight framings

**Fabric Behavior:** Mid-century wool suits, cotton shirts, typical 1950s-60s drape and construction.

**Accessory Caps:** Minimal 1-2 (glasses, cigarettes, hats, instruments as primary accessories)

**Color Palette:** When visible, muted greys, blacks, whites. Clothing subordinate to bold graphic color fields of layout.

**Props (YAML Pool):**

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**‚ùå Canvas Negatives:**

- "full-color photography"
- "decorative borders"
- "serif body text"
- "centered symmetrical layout"
- "soft focus romance"
- "elaborate backgrounds"
- "modern digital typography"
- "gradient effects"
- "photographic realism"
- "ornamental elements"

**‚úÖ Canvas Positives:**

- "exactly 1:1 square ratio"
- "duotone high-contrast photography"
- "bold sans-serif typography"
- "asymmetric modular grid"
- "Francis Wolff photographic style"
- "offset lithography 120-133 LPI halftone"
- "rotated 45-90¬∞ composition"
- "greenish-tint or reflex blue spot color"
- "hot-metal typesetting characteristics"
- "tight musician portrait cropping"

**Vocabulary Warnings:** Avoid "ornate," "decorative," "romantic," "soft," "elaborate." Embrace "bold," "graphic," "modular," "rhythmic," "cool."

------
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (1:1 Square):**

- Modular grid divisions (halves, thirds, quarters)
- Asymmetric photography placement (off-center, diagonal)
- Typography fills negative space aggressively
- Rotated compositions creating dynamic tension

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Grid/Symmetry:** Asymmetric modular systems, mathematical divisions without centered balance
- **Figure:Ground:** 40:60 ratio (photography 40%, typography/color blocks 60%)
- **Density:** Bold graphic impact through high contrast and large-scale elements
- **Lighting Logic:** Flat, even illumination reducing mid-tones, creating pure blacks and whites
- **Detail:Negative Space:** 50:50 ratio (equal weight between positive elements and voids)

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:** Vinyl LP album sleeve, offset lithography on quality coated stock (150-180gsm) preventing ink bleed, matte or semi-gloss finish.

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT decorative frames entirely. Bold color blocks function as geometric divisions, not ornamental borders.

**Production Context Anchor:** Offset lithography with specialized Blue Note inks, hot-metal or phototypesetting, duotone halftone screening, precise color registration within ¬±1mm tolerance.

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Perfect square enables rotated compositions, modular divisions, mathematical grid systems essential to Blue Note visual language.

------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** ESSENTIAL (typography often dominates photography)

**Ratio-Appropriate Zones:**

- Typography occupies 40-70% of canvas
- Rotated 45-90¬∞ cutting diagonally across composition
- Stacked vertically along edges
- Fragmented across multiple zones

**Copy Limits:**

- Artist name: 1-3 lines, often massive scale
- Album title: 1-2 lines, variable size
- Blue Note catalog number essential
- Maximum 6-8 words total across front cover

**Period-Appropriate Typography:**

- **Pre-1966:** Haas Inserat-Grotesk, Ultra Bodoni, Clarendon (Intertype line-casting)
- **Post-1966:** Linotype Spartan (distinctive horizontal serif on "1")
- **Size range:** Extreme variation from 8pt details to 144pt+ dominating letterforms
- **Manipulation:** Fragmentation, rotation, asymmetric stacking

**Font Recommendations:**

- **Google Font:** Oswald or Archivo Black (80% match for Inserat-Grotesk)
- **Better Match:** Helvetica Inserat, Trade Gothic Condensed Bold, Univers Extra Black

**Format-Specific Rules (Album Cover):**

- Artist name typically largest element (100-400pt scale)
- Album title secondary (40-80pt)
- Blue Note logo and catalog number essential (bottom corner, 8-12pt)
- Typography rotated, fragmented, or stacked for visual rhythm

**Historical Accuracy:** Hot-metal typesetting (1955-1966) shows slight irregularities, baseline variations. Phototypesetting (1966-1967) creates cleaner edges but maintains bold graphic impact.

**Production Method Integration:** Typography printed in black or spot color using offset lithography, perfect registration with photographic duotone elements, sharp edges from quality paperstock.
