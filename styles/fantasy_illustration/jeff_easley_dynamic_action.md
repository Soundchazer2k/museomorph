  Jeff Easley blows wind through every cape—thunderbolt dragons, lightning
  logos, and heroes braced mid-swing. His oil surfaces crackle with TSR-era
  drama. MuseoMorph keeps that stormy choreography alive with new villains,
  spell effects, and crumbling set pieces.

# Jeff Easley Style - Dynamic Gaming Action

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 gaming action format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL ATMOSPHERIC ACTION DOMINANCE:** Jeff Easley's moody fluid gaming art overrides ALL static poses, bright cheerful imagery, and passive character presentation. **COMPLETE ATMOSPHERIC GAMING TRANSFORMATION WITH DYNAMIC MOVEMENT REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Jeff Easley atmospheric gaming action** for **exact 2:3 format specification** - NOT static poses, bright imagery, or passive character design." **Anti-Static Priority:** **NO static character poses, bright cheerful colors, or passive presentation that eliminates atmospheric gaming movement.** **Completely redraw emphasizing atmospheric action movement and moody gaming excellence.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `brush-wash` **Pose Flag:** `foreshortened-diagonal` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Atmospheric Dynamic Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must exhibit atmospheric action movement with moody environmental integration, not static or bright presentation.** **Mode Selector:** [Atmospheric Action] for dynamic movement focus.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (gaming action cover format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with atmospheric action emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for maximum action impact (dramatic diagonal positioning with atmospheric movement emphasis)
- **Background Treatment:** Extend moody gaming environments (dungeons, battlefields, atmospheric landscapes) with dynamic depth and atmospheric action support

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **Atmospheric gaming styling** with **action readiness** and **environmental integration**, **practical gaming armor** with **movement functionality** and **atmospheric design**, **gaming adventure clothing** showing **action capability** and **environmental durability**, ornament scale **1-2** (functional accessories, atmospheric gaming gear, action elements); hair & makeup scale **1** (practical styling for **atmospheric action**); **action-ready footwear** with **atmospheric gaming functionality**.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Atmospheric gaming warrior styling** with **dynamic action emphasis**, **battle-tested armor** with **environmental design** and **atmospheric wear patterns**; accessories **2-3** pieces (atmospheric gaming weapons, action gear, environmental battle equipment); **atmospheric gaming warrior aesthetic** with **environmental sophistication**.
- **Fabric behavior:** **Atmospheric gaming fabric physics** with **action movement** and **environmental interaction** showing **atmospheric conditions** and **environmental integration**.
- **Wardrobe variation required:** Change garment colors/styles between iterations through atmospheric gaming palette avoiding identical repetition.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [atmospheric gaming weapon, action shield, adventure pack, environmental tool, atmospheric torch]
  occasional: [magical atmospheric item, dungeon equipment, environmental standard, action rope]
  rare: [legendary atmospheric weapon, epic environmental gear, atmospheric artifact, action treasure]
  micro: [gaming dice, atmospheric charm, action detail, environmental accent]
  exclusions:
    - "no decorative items inappropriate to atmospheric gaming action"
    - "no passive objects that break dynamic atmospheric movement emphasis"
    - "no bright items that eliminate moody atmospheric integration"
  dependencies:
    - "gaming items require functional design and atmospheric action capability integration"
    - "environmental elements must support dynamic movement and atmospheric gaming"
    - "all props must show atmospheric gaming sophistication"
```
## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**⌘ Canvas Negatives:** "static character poses", "bright cheerful imagery", "passive presentation", "portrait-style composition"; **NO static positioning that eliminates atmospheric action**; **NO bright colors that break moody atmospheric integration**; **NO passive poses that lack atmospheric gaming adventure emphasis**; **NO portrait compositions that eliminate dynamic environmental integration**. **✓ Canvas Positives:** "exactly 2:3", "atmospheric gaming action"; **Fluid atmospheric movement** with **action emphasis**; **Moody environmental lighting** with **atmospheric gaming adventure integration**; **Dynamic diagonal character poses** with **atmospheric movement capability**; **TSR atmospheric gaming excellence** with **environmental sophistication**.
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 2:3 Gaming Action:** Character atmospheric movement with environmental support and gaming cover impact, vertical emphasis with atmospheric action dominance ≥70%

**Staging:** Subjects positioned within **atmospheric gaming scenarios** showing **action capability** and **environmental adventure** in **moody atmospheric gaming environments**. **Camera/perspective:** **Atmospheric action angles** supporting **movement emphasis** and **environmental presentation**. **Background density:** **Atmospheric gaming environments** with **moody lighting effects** and **dynamic environmental integration**. **Figure:ground:** 70% atmospheric action, 30% environmental context. **Lighting logic:** atmospheric gaming lighting with moody environmental impact. **Detail:negative space ratio:** optimized for 2:3 atmospheric action format. **Surface Context Anchor:** TSR atmospheric gaming illustration surface appropriate to dynamic action adventure. **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Atmospheric gaming environments extend naturally within 2:3 ratio while maintaining dynamic action focus and environmental atmospheric gaming excellence.
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)
