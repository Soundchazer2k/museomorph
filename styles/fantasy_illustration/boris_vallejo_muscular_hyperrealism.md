about: >
  Boris Vallejo airbrushed bodybuilders into myth—chrome highlights, oiled skin,
  and cosmic backdrops. His hyperreal figures feel sculpted more than painted.
  We continue that polished spectacle with new heroes, creatures, and neon
  nebulae.

## Boris Vallejo Style - Enhanced Muscular Hyperrealism

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 cover perfection** or **1:1 poster format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL MUSCULAR PERFECTION DOMINANCE:** Boris Vallejo's hyperrealistic muscular mastery with **photographic anatomical precision** and **classical oil painting refinement** overrides ALL simplified anatomy, cartoon proportions, and amateur figure rendering. **COMPLETE HYPERREALISTIC ANATOMICAL TRANSFORMATION WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC MUSCLE DEFINITION REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Boris Vallejo hyperrealistic muscular perfection** with **photographic anatomical precision**, **smooth classical oil painting technique**, and **idealized proportional excellence** for **exact format specification** - NOT simplified anatomy, rough brushwork, or amateur figure rendering." **Anti-Simplified Priority:** **NO rough brushwork, simplified anatomical rendering, cartoon muscle definition, or amateur techniques that eliminate photographic hyperrealism and classical refinement.** **Completely redraw emphasizing photographic anatomical precision with smooth classical oil painting mastery and idealized proportional perfection.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `diffusion-glam` **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` **Hyperrealistic Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must exhibit photographic anatomical perfection with classical oil painting refinement, not rough or simplified presentation.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Muscular Perfection] or [Hyperrealistic Fantasy] per image.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (cover perfection format)
- **1:1** (poster heroic format)
- **3:4** (classical hyperrealistic portrait)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** strict-reframe with hyperrealistic perfection emphasis and classical composition
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for maximum anatomical showcase with idealized heroic positioning
- **Background Treatment:** Extend idealized classical fantasy environments with perfect atmospheric gradients and refined lighting effects
- **Format Justification:** Vallejo's cover art tradition requires precise classical framing supporting anatomical perfection and hyperrealistic fantasy presentation
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity
