about: >
  Don Maitz marries romantic oil technique with salt-stained
  authenticity—rigging diagrams, plein-air skies, and swaggering privateers. His
  canvas feels like a historical novel mid-climax. We keep that seaworthy
  realism while rotating in new crews, ports, and treasure myths.

## Don Maitz Style - Narrative Realism Maritime Adventures

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 book cover format** or **3:4 classical portrait** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **Redraw command:** "Redraw the subject in **Don Maitz's narrative realism** style for **exact format specification**." **Likeness (style-first):** Identity via **heroic silhouette/adventurous gesture/confident determined expression**; integrate into **traditional oil painting** medium emphasizing **maritime authenticity** and **historical adventure**. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `tempera-precise` **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style dominance:** Maitz's narrative realism overrides fantasy clichés, prioritizing **authentic historical detail** and **plausible adventure scenarios**. **Gender respect:** Honor presented gender while maintaining Maitz's **heroic adventure proportions** and **confident character design**. **IP guardrail:** Archetypes only; no direct Captain Morgan references or copyrighted characters. **Mode Selector:** Choose [Adventure Portrait] or [Maritime Scene] per image.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (book cover adventure format)
- **3:4** (classical portrait emphasis)
- **16:9** (panoramic maritime scene)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with narrative environmental expansion
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for heroic adventure impact (confident positioning within plausible historical setting)
- **Background Treatment:** Extend authentic maritime or adventure environments (ships, tropical islands, historical architecture) with plein air landscape accuracy
- **Format Justification:** Maitz's narrative illustration tradition supports any ratio through environmental storytelling while maintaining character heroism and historical authenticity
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Don Maitz's distinguished approach (1975-present) represents **"fantastic realism"** through **traditional oil painting techniques** combined with **maritime authenticity** and **adventure narrative**. Production method emphasizes **classical oil painting methods** with **centuries-old techniques**, **plein air landscape observation**, **historical research accuracy**, and **narrative illustration principles**. Purpose focuses on **adventure storytelling** through **heroic character presentation** and **authentic environmental integration**. Hallmark motifs include **pirate and maritime adventures**, **authentic sailing vessels with rigging accuracy**, **tropical island landscapes**, **classical figure painting proportions**, **swashbuckling adventure scenarios**, and **plein air atmospheric effects**. Period framing encompasses **historical maritime settings** with **adventure romance elements** creating **authentic adventure fantasy**.
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Classical painting line work** with **traditional brush control** ranging **0.5-1.5 pt** for **form definition** and **atmospheric edge work**; **no hard outline dependency** - forms defined through **color temperature** and **value relationships**. **Traditional drawing foundation** with **accurate anatomical proportions**. **Color:** **Classical oil painting palette** at **65-80% saturation** with **authentic color relationships** and **plein air atmospheric perspective**. **Maritime colors**: **ocean blues (#1e40af, #0369a1)**, **tropical turquoise (#06b6d4)**, **sunset golds (#f59e0b)**, **authentic wood browns (#92400e)**. **Temperature-based modeling** with **warm lights** and **cool shadows**. **Texture:** **Traditional oil painting surface** with **visible brush work** and **classical painting techniques**. **Maritime texture accuracy**: **rope and rigging detail**, **weathered wood grain**, **fabric drape physics**, **ocean wave patterns**. **Atmospheric perspective** through **color temperature shifts**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Character faces** receive **portrait-quality attention** with **classical proportions**, **maritime gear** rendered with **historical accuracy**, **environmental elements** showing **plein air observation** and **authentic detail**, **atmospheric integration** where **characters belong naturally** in their **adventure settings**. **Material simulation:** **Traditional oil painting techniques** with **classical color mixing** and **brush economy**. **Authentic texture rendering**: **metal, fabric, wood, water** with **historical accuracy**. **Atmospheric effects** through **traditional glazing** and **scumbling techniques**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Classical narrative composition extends naturally within declared aspect ratio with authentic adventure environmental integration. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 65-75%, chaos to 10-20%, CFG scale 8-11 for **classical realism** with **adventure authenticity**.
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**
