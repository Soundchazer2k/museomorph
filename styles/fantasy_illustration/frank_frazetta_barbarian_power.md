about: >
  Frank Frazetta sculpted muscle and mist with palette knives—charging steeds,
  snarled hair, and volcanic backdrops. Each piece hits like a Heavy Metal
  gatefold. We keep that sweaty ferocity while inventing fresh warlords, beasts,
  and storm-lit citadels.

## Frank Frazetta Style - Enhanced Barbarian Fantasy v2

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 paperback cover** or **3:4 dramatic portrait** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL PRIMAL POWER DOMINANCE:** Frank Frazetta's quintessential barbarian fantasy with **hyper-muscular anatomy** and **dramatic chiaroscuro lighting** overrides ALL refined illustration, delicate rendering, and civilized character presentation. **COMPLETE PRIMAL SAVAGE TRANSFORMATION WITH EXPLOSIVE KINETIC ENERGY REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Frank Frazetta hyper-muscular barbarian power** with **extreme light-dark contrast** and **gestural oil painting brushwork** for **exact format specification** - NOT refined illustration, clean digital rendering, or understated character design." **Anti-Refined Priority:** **NO clean digital techniques, even lighting, understated musculature, or refined rendering that eliminates explosive primal power and dramatic contrast.** **Completely redraw emphasizing hyper-muscular barbarian anatomy with extreme chiaroscuro and gestural painting confidence.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `fresco-matte` **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Primal Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must exhibit explosive kinetic energy with hyper-muscular definition and dramatic lighting contrasts, not clean or understated presentation.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Barbarian Power] or [Savage Fantasy Scene] per image.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (paperback cover barbarian format)
- **3:4** (dramatic savage portrait)
- **16:9** (epic barbarian landscape)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with dramatic atmospheric expansion and swirling environmental effects
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for maximum explosive impact with dynamic diagonal emphasis and kinetic energy
- **Background Treatment:** Extend dramatic fantasy atmospheres (swirling storm clouds, supernatural mists, volcanic landscapes, mystical energy effects) with extreme atmospheric perspective
- **Format Justification:** Frazetta's paperback tradition requires explosive framing supporting hyper-muscular character dominance and dramatic environmental storytelling
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Frank Frazetta's revolutionary approach (1960s-2010) established **quintessential barbarian fantasy** through **explosive visual power** and **hyper-muscular anatomical mastery**. Production method emphasizes **gestural oil painting excellence** with **confident brush confidence**, **dramatic chiaroscuro mastery**, **kinetic energy capture**, and **anatomical exaggeration for heroic impact**. Purpose centers on **mythic storytelling** through **explosive action moments** and **larger-than-life primal scenes**. Hallmark motifs include **hyper-muscular barbaric warriors with exaggerated anatomy**, **explosive kinetic action poses**, **dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with deep shadows**, **swirling atmospheric effects**, **gestural oil painting brushwork**, **warm-dominant color temperature**, and **savage primeval energy**. Period framing encompasses **timeless barbarian mythology** with **explosive primal atmosphere** creating **quintessential sword-and-sorcery dynamism**.
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Gestural oil painting brushwork** with **confident explosive strokes** ranging **1.5-4.0 pt** based on **kinetic emphasis** and **anatomical definition**; **form-defining brush confidence** rather than **linear dependency**. **Hyper-muscular character anatomy** with **exaggerated barbarian proportions**. **Color:** **Warm-dominant dramatic palette** at **80-95% saturation** with **extreme chiaroscuro relationships** and **explosive atmospheric emphasis**. **Frazetta signature warm dominance**: **golden flesh tones (#daa520, #cd853f)**, **dramatic sunset oranges (#ff6347, #ff4500)**, **deep contrast purples (#4b0082, #663399)**, **atmospheric blues (#4682b4, #5f9ea0)**, **volcanic reds (#dc143c, #b22222)**. **Extreme chiaroscuro temperature contrast** with **warm light, cool shadow mastery**. **Texture:** **Gestural oil painting surface** with **visible brush confidence** and **explosive texture emphasis**. **Kinetic texture mastery**: **hyper-muscular definition with anatomical exaggeration, dramatic fabric with movement emphasis, weapon surfaces with battle energy, atmospheric elements with swirling dynamic integration**. **Paperback cover energy impact** throughout. **Detail hierarchy:** **Hyper-muscular character anatomy** receives **maximum explosive attention** with **exaggerated proportion emphasis**, **fantasy weapons** rendered with **kinetic functionality** and **dramatic detail**, **environmental elements** showing **swirling atmospheric mastery**, **explosive moment impact** prioritized for **kinetic storytelling**. **Material simulation:** **Gestural oil painting techniques** with **brush confidence mastery** and **kinetic surface treatment**. **Explosive surface effects**: **hyper-muscular definition, swirling atmospheric textures, dramatic lighting integration, kinetic energy capture** all with **barbarian dynamism**. **Atmospheric Requirements:** **Swirling clouds, supernatural mists, dust effects, or energy phenomena** creating **dynamic environmental movement**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Explosive barbarian composition extends naturally within declared aspect ratio with kinetic power emphasis and dramatic atmospheric presentation. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 80-90%, chaos to 25-35%, CFG scale 12-16 for **explosive power** with **dramatic atmospheric effects**. **Critical anatomy enforcement:** Characters must display hyper-muscular definition with exaggerated proportions. **Critical lighting enforcement:** Extreme light-dark contrast with warm highlights and cool deep shadows. **Critical brushwork enforcement:** Visible gestural oil painting texture throughout composition.
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **Barbarian heroine styling** with **minimal practical coverage** and **kinetic movement emphasis**, **functional primitive armor** with **dramatic design** and **explosive energy integration**, **flowing primitive clothing** showing **kinetic design** and **atmospheric interaction**, ornament scale **1-2** (primitive jewelry with dramatic impact, barbarian accessories with kinetic emphasis); hair & makeup scale **1** (natural flowing styling with **kinetic movement** for **atmospheric interaction**); **practical barbarian footwear** with **kinetic functionality**.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Hyper-muscular barbarian styling** with **anatomical showcase emphasis**, **minimal armor design** showcasing **exaggerated musculature** and **kinetic strength**; accessories **1-2** pieces (massive primitive weapons, dramatic barbarian gear); **explosive warrior aesthetic** with **kinetic sophistication**.

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**⌐ Canvas Negatives:** "clean digital rendering", "even lighting", "understated musculature", "refined brushwork", "static atmospheric effects"; **NO clean surfaces that eliminate gestural painting foundation**; **NO even lighting that lacks dramatic chiaroscuro**; **NO understated anatomy that lacks hyper-muscular exaggeration**; **NO static backgrounds that lack atmospheric dynamism**. **✓ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "hyper-muscular barbarian anatomy", "extreme chiaroscuro lighting", "gestural oil painting brushwork", "explosive kinetic energy"; **Dramatic light-dark contrast** with **warm highlight, cool shadow mastery**; **Hyper-muscular character definition** with **anatomical exaggeration**; **Swirling atmospheric effects** with **kinetic environmental movement**; **Gestural brush confidence** with **explosive surface energy**.
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns
