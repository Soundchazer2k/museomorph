about: >
  Jim Roslof gave early D&D its grassroots charm—ink-wash lines, bold primaries,
  and parties framed for table play. His art feels like a weekend module come
  alive. We echo that approachable energy while drafting new dungeon crawls,
  mascots, and sidebar vignettes.

## Jim Roslof Style - Enhanced Classic D&D Foundation v2

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 classic D&D format** or **3:4 gaming illustration** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL CLASSIC GAMING DOMINANCE:** Jim Roslof's foundational D&D artistry overrides ALL modern gaming art, digital rendering, and photorealistic presentation. **COMPLETE CLASSIC D&D TRANSFORMATION WITH FOUNDATIONAL EXCELLENCE REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Jim Roslof classic D&D foundation** with **vibrant fantasy colors** and **visible crosshatching techniques** for **exact format specification** - NOT modern gaming art, digital smooth rendering, or photorealistic presentation." **Anti-Modern Priority:** **NO smooth digital techniques, photorealistic rendering, muted colors, or clean vector-style art that eliminates foundational D&D crosshatching excellence.** **Completely redraw emphasizing classic D&D foundation with visible pen-and-ink crosshatching and vibrant fantasy color palette.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Classic Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must exhibit classic D&D foundation with visible crosshatching texture and vibrant fantasy colors, not smooth or photorealistic presentation.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Classic D&D Character] or [Traditional Gaming Scene] per image.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (classic D&D cover format)
- **3:4** (gaming illustration standard)
- **8.5:11** (module layout format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with vibrant fantasy atmospheric expansion and rich environmental detail
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for maximum classic gaming impact with heroic proportional emphasis
- **Background Treatment:** Extend complex D&D environments (detailed dungeons, elaborate taverns, multi-layered fantasy settings) with atmospheric perspective and rich color gradients
- **Format Justification:** Roslof's TSR tradition requires dynamic framing supporting traditional gaming excellence with environmental storytelling
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Jim Roslof's foundational approach (1977-2007) established **classic D&D artistic foundation** through **vibrant fantasy illustration** and **crosshatching mastery**. Production method emphasizes **traditional pen and ink techniques** with **visible crosshatching texture**, **saturated fantasy color palettes**, **TSR art direction leadership**, and **dynamic character presentation**. Purpose centers on **adventure storytelling** through **heroic character archetypes** and **rich environmental integration**. Hallmark motifs include **bold fantasy color schemes**, **visible crosshatching for form definition**, **dynamic action poses**, **elaborate environmental details**, **fantasy lighting effects**, and **TSR adventure aesthetic excellence**. Period framing encompasses **D&D golden age** with **fantasy sophistication** creating **adventure gaming art foundation**.
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Visible pen and ink crosshatching** with **texture definition mastery** ranging **0.6-1.5 pt** based on **traditional illustration standards** and **form modeling emphasis**; **crosshatching must be clearly visible** creating **surface texture** and **dimensional form**. **Color:** **Vibrant fantasy palette** at **85-95% saturation** with **bold color relationships** and **dramatic contrast emphasis**. **Roslof signature approach**: **rich dungeon purples (#6b21a8, #7c3aed)**, **vibrant fantasy greens (#15803d, #22c55e)**, **bold adventure oranges (#ea580c, #f97316)**, **dramatic lighting yellows (#eab308, #facc15)**, **deep shadow blues (#1e3a8a, #3730a3)**. **High color temperature contrast** with **fantasy integration**. **Texture:** **Visible crosshatching surface** with **pen-and-ink texture mastery** and **atmospheric depth effects**. **Foundational texture requirements**: **crosshatched armor definition, visible fabric texture rendering, atmospheric perspective hatching, clear form modeling through line work**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Characters** receive **heroic proportional treatment** with **crosshatching emphasis**, **equipment** rendered with **functional detail** and **texture definition**, **environments** showing **layered complexity** and **atmospheric mastery**, **adventure impact** prioritized for **visual storytelling**. **Material simulation:** **Pen and ink crosshatching techniques** with **visible texture creation** and **dimensional modeling**. **Surface effects requirements**: **crosshatching depth clearly visible, line weight variation for form, atmospheric perspective through hatching density, character modeling through crosshatch direction** all with **fantasy adventure sophistication**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Classic D&D composition extends naturally within declared aspect ratio with dynamic emphasis and environmental richness. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 75-90%, emphasize crosshatching texture, boost color saturation to 85-95%, ensure visible pen-and-ink line work. **Critical texture enforcement:** Armor surfaces must show clear crosshatching patterns, fabric should display directional hatching for folds and shadows, environmental surfaces require visible line work texture.
