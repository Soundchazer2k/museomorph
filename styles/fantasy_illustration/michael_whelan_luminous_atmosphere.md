about: >
  Michael Whelan paints light as a character—iridescent skies, translucent
  fabrics, and dreamlike architecture. His covers glow with quiet awe. We
  sustain that atmospheric lyricism while unveiling new worlds, apparitions, and
  color harmonies.

## Michael Whelan Style - Enhanced Luminous Atmospheric Realism v2

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 literary cover** or **16:9 wraparound panorama** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL LUMINOUS ATMOSPHERIC DOMINANCE:** Michael Whelan's imaginative luminous realism with **multiple glowing light sources** and **ethereal atmospheric effects** overrides ALL flat illustration, conventional fantasy, and non-luminous character presentation. **COMPLETE LUMINOUS ETHEREAL TRANSFORMATION WITH COSMIC WONDER INTEGRATION REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Michael Whelan luminous ethereal realism** with **multiple glowing light sources**, **soft atmospheric luminosity**, **surreal cosmic elements**, and **impossible architectural landscapes** for **exact format specification** - NOT flat illustration, conventional fantasy, or high-contrast non-atmospheric rendering." **Anti-Conventional Priority:** **NO flat illustration techniques, conventional landscapes, high-contrast colors, or non-luminous presentation that eliminates ethereal atmospheric wonder and cosmic surrealism.** **Completely redraw emphasizing ethereal luminosity with multiple light sources and impossible cosmic landscapes.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `tempera-precise` **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Luminous Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must exhibit ethereal luminosity with multiple light sources and surreal cosmic integration, not conventional or high-contrast presentation.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Luminous Character] or [Ethereal Cosmic Scene] per image.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (literary cover standard)
- **16:9** (wraparound panoramic scene)
- **3:4** (book cover portrait focus)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with ethereal luminous expansion and impossible cosmic architecture
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned within vast surreal landscapes with multiple atmospheric depth planes and luminous integration
- **Background Treatment:** Extend impossible cosmic vistas with floating elements, multiple celestial bodies, ethereal light sources, and surreal architectural impossibilities
- **Format Justification:** Whelan's literary cover tradition requires expansive cosmic framing supporting atmospheric storytelling and ethereal wonder presentation with surreal impossibilities
