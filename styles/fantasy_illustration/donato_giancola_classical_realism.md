# Donato Giancola Style - Classical Narrative Realism

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 classical narrative** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL ACADEMIC PAINTING DOMINANCE:** Donato Giancola's museum-quality academic realism overrides ALL simplified illustration, amateur painting, and non-classical approaches. **COMPLETE ACADEMIC PAINTING MASTERY WITH NARRATIVE SOPHISTICATION REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Donato Giancola academic narrative realism** for **exact 3:4 format specification** - NOT simplified illustration, amateur painting, or non-academic rendering." **Anti-Amateur Priority:** **NO simplified illustration techniques, amateur painting approaches, or non-academic rendering that eliminates classical mastery and narrative sophistication.** **Completely redraw emphasizing academic painting excellence and sophisticated narrative integration.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `tempera-precise` **Pose Flag:** `contrapposto` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Academic Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must exhibit museum-quality academic painting with sophisticated narrative integration, not illustration or amateur aesthetic.** **Mode Selector:** [Classical Narrative] for sophisticated storytelling focus.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **3:4** (classical narrative portrait)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with classical narrative expansion
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for maximum narrative impact (classical composition with sophisticated storytelling emphasis)
- **Background Treatment:** Extend sophisticated narrative environments (historical settings, mythological landscapes, classical architecture) with museum-quality atmospheric depth
- **Format Justification:** Giancola's classical narrative philosophy requires 3:4 format supporting both intimate character focus and expansive environmental scope with academic painting precision

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Matrix**

- **Adults (female-presenting):** **Academic historical styling** with **research accuracy** and **narrative character development**, **period costume precision** with **museum-quality detail** and **historical foundation**, **sophisticated classical clothing** showing **narrative purpose** and **academic authenticity**, ornament scale **2-3** (historical jewelry with research accuracy, classical accessories with narrative purpose, academic elements); hair & makeup scale **1-2** (classical styling with **historical research accuracy**); **period-accurate footwear** with **academic historical authenticity**.
- **Adults (male-presenting):** **Academic historical costume** with **research precision** and **narrative character integration**, **sophisticated period styling** with **museum-quality detail** and **classical foundation**, **historical accuracy** supporting **sophisticated narrative development**; accessories **2-3** pieces (historical weapons with research accuracy, classical items with narrative purpose, academic artifacts); **classical character aesthetic** with **academic foundation** and **narrative sophistication**.
- **Fabric behavior:** **Academic fabric physics** with **classical accuracy** and **historical authenticity** showing **period-appropriate drape** and **narrative environmental interaction**.
- **Wardrobe variation required:** Change garment colors/styles between iterations through classical academic palette avoiding identical repetition.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [classical weapon with historical accuracy, historical artifact with research precision, narrative object with storytelling purpose, period tool with academic detail, classical symbol with narrative meaning]
  occasional: [historical manuscript with period accuracy, classical instrument with research detail, period jewelry with historical authenticity, narrative device with storytelling sophistication]
  rare: [legendary historical item with academic research, classical masterwork with museum quality, narrative treasure with storytelling excellence, academic artifact with historical precision]
  micro: [classical detail with academic accuracy, historical accent with research precision, narrative token with storytelling purpose, period element with classical authenticity]
  exclusions:
    - "no anachronistic items inappropriate to classical narrative sophistication"
    - "no simplified objects that break academic precision and historical research"
    - "no amateur elements that eliminate museum-quality surface treatment"
  dependencies:
    - "classical items require historical research accuracy and museum-quality rendering"
    - "narrative elements must support sophisticated storytelling integration with academic excellence"
    - "all props must show academic painting surface quality with narrative sophistication"
```
## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**⌘ Canvas Negatives:** "simplified illustration techniques", "amateur painting approaches", "non-academic rendering", "flat surface treatment"; **NO illustration shortcuts that eliminate academic mastery**; **NO amateur techniques that break classical painting precision**; **NO simplified approaches that lack museum-quality surface treatment**; **NO flat rendering that eliminates atmospheric narrative sophistication**. **✓ Canvas Positives:** "exactly 3:4", "academic narrative mastery"; **Museum-quality painting techniques** with **academic precision**; **Classical figure painting** with **historical research accuracy**; **Sophisticated narrative integration** with **atmospheric storytelling mastery**; **Academic drawing foundation** with **narrative excellence**.
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 3:4 Classical:** Academic narrative portrait with sophisticated character development and classical environmental integration, vertical emphasis with narrative storytelling dominance ≥70%

**Staging:** Subjects positioned within **sophisticated classical narrative scenarios** showing **academic character development** and **historical authenticity** in **museum-quality environments** with **academic composition principles** and **narrative storytelling sophistication**. **Camera/perspective:** **Classical painting viewpoints** supporting **narrative clarity** and **sophisticated character presentation** with **academic excellence**. **Background density:** **Museum-quality environments** with **classical atmospheric mastery** and **sophisticated narrative environmental integration**. **Figure:ground:** 70% narrative character, 30% environmental context. **Lighting logic:** classical academic lighting with narrative atmospheric depth. **Detail:negative space ratio:** optimized for 3:4 narrative focus format. **Surface Context Anchor:** Academic oil painting surface appropriate to sophisticated narrative realism. **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Classical narrative environments extend naturally within 3:4 ratio while maintaining academic precision and sophisticated storytelling integration.
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** allow - **Essential** for narrative illustration tradition; **allow embedded text** for **sophisticated storytelling purposes**.

**Ratio-Appropriate Zones:** Classical composition optimized for 3:4 aspect ratio with **narrative text integration**

**Copy limits:** ≤4 words/line for **classical titles**, ≤5 coverlines positioned within **sophisticated composition**

**Font recommendation:** **Closest Google Font: Cinzel (classical inscription analog, 85%). Better: Trajan Pro or classical serif fonts appropriate to narrative sophistication.**

**Format-Specific Text Rules:**

- **Narrative cover mode:** mandatory sophisticated text integration, author > title hierarchy, classical typography

**Historical accuracy:** fonts must support classical narrative sophistication without breaking academic artistic presentation.
