## Keith Parkinson Style - Epic Fantasy Realism

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 fantasy epic format** or **16:9 landscape panorama** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL TACTILE REALISM DOMINANCE:** Keith Parkinson's museum-quality oil painting realism overrides ALL digital art smoothness, simplified fantasy, and flat rendering approaches. **COMPLETE TRADITIONAL OIL PAINTING WITH TACTILE SURFACE REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Keith Parkinson tactile oil painting realism** for **exact format specification** - NOT digital art, simplified fantasy, or smooth rendering." **Anti-Digital Priority:** **NO digital smoothness, flat surfaces, or simplified rendering that eliminates tactile oil painting quality.** **Completely redraw using traditional oil painting techniques with visible brushwork and surface texture.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `tempera-precise` **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Traditional Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must exhibit tactile oil painting realism with visible brushwork, not digital or smooth aesthetic.** **Mode Selector:** Choose [Epic Character] or [Fantasy Landscape] per image.
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- **2:3** (fantasy epic character focus)
- **16:9** (fantasy landscape panorama)
- **3:4** (classical fantasy portrait)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend with epic fantasy environmental expansion
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for maximum fantasy epic impact (heroic positioning within vast fantasy landscapes)
- **Background Treatment:** Extend detailed fantasy environments (mountains, castles, magical landscapes) with atmospheric depth and classical landscape accuracy
- **Format Justification:** Parkinson's epic fantasy philosophy requires expansive formats supporting both intimate character focus and vast environmental scope with painterly realism
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

Keith Parkinson's masterful approach (1980-2005) established **"realism painted with a brush"** through **classical painting techniques** applied to **fantasy subject matter**. Production method emphasizes **traditional oil painting mastery** with **solid classical foundation**, **Frank Frazetta and Roger Dean influences**, **tactile surface quality**, and **atmospheric perspective mastery**. Purpose centers on **epic fantasy storytelling** through **believable fantasy worlds** and **heroic character integration**. Hallmark motifs include **magnificent gnarled trees with detailed bark texture**, **majestic dragons with believable anatomy**, **atmospheric fantasy landscapes**, **classical female figures with Hellenistic proportions**, **detailed armor and weaponry**, and **tactile surface quality throughout**. Period framing encompasses **timeless fantasy settings** with **classical painting sophistication** creating **museum-quality fantasy art**.
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line:** **Painterly form definition** through **color and value relationships** rather than **hard outline dependency**; **classical drawing foundation** at **traditional academic standards** with **accurate anatomical knowledge**. **Brush-defined edges** ranging from **sharp focus areas** to **atmospheric soft transitions**. **Color:** **Rich earth-tone fantasy palette** at **80-90% saturation** with **deep atmospheric color relationships** and **natural landscape color harmony**. **Parkinson signature earth tones**: **deep forest greens (#0f5132, #166534)**, **rich mountain stone (#4b5563, #374151)**, **golden firelight (#d97706, #ea580c)**, **natural sky blues (#0369a1, #0284c7)**, **weathered leather browns (#92400e, #a16207)**. **Natural color temperature relationships** with **atmospheric depth through color**. **Texture:** **Authentic oil painting surface** with **visible impasto brushwork** and **traditional painting texture variety**. **Parkinson texture mastery**: **individual dragon scales with raised paint texture**, **deeply grooved tree bark with dimensional brushwork**, **fabric showing authentic paint application**, **metal surfaces with varied brush techniques**. **Multi-layered paint application** showing **traditional oil painting depth**. **Tactile surface quality** where **paint texture is visible and dimensional**. **Detail hierarchy:** **Dragon anatomy** receives **maximum biological precision** with **individual scale rendering**, **fantasy creatures** with **anatomical plausibility** and **detailed texture work**, **environmental elements** showing **multi-plane atmospheric depth** and **natural landscape mastery**, **magical elements** integrated with **painterly convincingness**. **Traditional oil painting surface emphasis** where **brushwork contributes to form and texture**. **Material simulation:** **Classical oil painting techniques** with **centuries-old methods** and **fantasy imagination integration**. **Surface variety mastery**: **rough stone, smooth scales, weathered wood, flowing water** all with **tactile authenticity**. **Atmospheric effects** through **traditional glazing** and **classical painting methods**. **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Epic fantasy composition extends naturally within declared aspect ratio with classical landscape integration and tactile surface quality. **Renderer mapping hint:** Set stylization to 70-80%, chaos to 15-25%, CFG scale 9-12 for **classical realism** with **fantasy imagination**.
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

    - "magical elements must integrate believably with realistic rendering"
```
## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**⌘ Canvas Negatives:** "digital art smoothness", "flat rendering", "simplified fantasy illustration", "blue-dominant coloring"; **NO digital painting techniques that eliminate oil painting texture**; **NO simplified creature anatomy that breaks biological precision**; **NO flat environmental backgrounds that lack atmospheric depth**; **NO smooth surfaces that eliminate visible brushwork**. **✓ Canvas Positives:** "exactly [declared ratio]", "epic fantasy realism"; **Classical painting techniques** with **tactile surface quality**; **Fantasy elements** integrated with **painterly believability**; **Atmospheric perspective** with **classical landscape mastery**; **Heroic character proportions** with **anatomical accuracy**.
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **For 2:3 Fantasy Epic:** Character heroism emphasis with detailed fantasy environmental support
- **For 16:9 Landscape:** Panoramic fantasy scope with atmospheric depth and character environmental integration
- **For 3:4 Classical:** Portrait focus with Parkinson's tactile surface quality and fantasy context

**Staging:** Subjects positioned within **epic fantasy scenarios** showing **heroic presence** in **vast, believable fantasy landscapes** with **classical composition principles**. **Camera/perspective:** **Classical painting viewpoints** supporting **epic scope** and **heroic character presentation**. **Background density:** **Multi-plane atmospheric environments** with **natural landscape mastery** and **traditional oil painting atmospheric quality**. **Natural environmental integration** showing **forest depth, mountain vistas, and creature habitats** with **atmospheric perspective through multiple depth planes**. **Surface Context Anchor:** Classical oil painting surface appropriate to epic fantasy storytelling **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Epic fantasy environments extend naturally within declared ratio while maintaining classical painting quality and tactile surface authenticity.
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** omit - **Not authentic** to Parkinson's fine art approach; **omit all embedded text**. Parkinson emphasized **pure visual fantasy storytelling** through **classical painting presentation**.
