# Todd Lockwood Style - Dragon Mastery Epic Fantasy

> **Renderer-Agnostic Adapter:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; canvas override mandatory; style over likeness; quantifiers are authoritative; text only if Section 8 allows; no nudity/gore/logos/watermarks; minors = age-appropriate, non-sexualized attire; honor presented gender; run validation checklist silently and regenerate on fail.
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 epic fantasy format** - ignore source image dimensions completely. **CRITICAL ANATOMICAL DETAIL DOMINANCE:** Todd Lockwood's meticulous individual scale rendering overrides ALL simplified creature design, digital smoothness, and generic fantasy rendering. **COMPLETE TRADITIONAL ILLUSTRATION WITH BIOLOGICAL PRECISION REQUIRED.** **Redraw command:** "Transform subject into authentic **Todd Lockwood anatomical dragon mastery** for **exact 2:3 format specification** - NOT simplified creatures, digital smoothness, or generic fantasy art." **Anti-Digital Priority:** **NO digital art smoothness, generic dragon anatomy, or simplified rendering that eliminates individual anatomical detail.** **Completely redraw emphasizing traditional illustration foundation with meticulous biological dragon anatomy.** **Face-Treatment Flag:** `tempera-precise` **Pose Flag:** `power-stance` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Traditional Illustration Medium Enforcement:** **Subject must exhibit traditional illustration quality with individual anatomical precision, not digital or simplified creature design.** **Mode Selector:** [Dragon Mastery] for anatomical detail focus.

**Prop Selector**

```yaml
props:
  common: [anatomically detailed dragon, epic weapon with traditional detail, magical artifact, heroic shield, fantasy tool]
  occasional: [legendary sword, dragon egg with scale detail, magical orb, epic armor piece, fantasy mount]
  rare: [ancient dragon with individual scale rendering, legendary artifact, epic magical weapon, heroic treasure]
  micro: [individual dragon scale, magical gem, heroic symbol, epic detail element]
  exclusions:
    - "no simplified or cartoon dragon elements inappropriate to anatomical precision"
    - "no digital art items that break traditional illustration authenticity"
    - "no generic fantasy elements that lack individual anatomical detail"
  dependencies:
    - "dragon items require individual anatomical accuracy and traditional illustration sophistication"
    - "epic elements must integrate with anatomical narrative clarity"
    - "all props must show traditional illustration surface quality"
```
