# José Guadalupe Posada

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.

**Canvas Override Mandate:** Compose for declared target aspect ratio; source image dimensions may influence final output.

**Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette, caricature, and satirical expression — not photographic accuracy.

**Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("60-90% figure dominance," "15-50 lines per inch," "40-60% black areas") override descriptive language.

**Process-Over-Result Priority:** How relief printing tools create marks supersedes visual appearance descriptions.

**Material Physics Authority:** Wood/metal plate carving limitations, cheap wood-pulp paper characteristics, and relief printing specifications override aesthetic preferences.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `engrave-hatch` or `woodblock-carved` — Bold outlines with parallel/cross-hatched relief printing characteristics; caricature/satirical proportions.

**Pose Flags:** `gestural-fluid`, `candid-motion` — Dynamic action poses captured mid-movement (dancing, working, fighting, performing).

**Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` or `format-native` — Commercial broadside format flexibility.

**Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.

**Text policy:** Omit all text unless Section 8 authorizes.

**Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore beyond period-appropriate social satire context; no real logos/watermarks/signatures.

**Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest period-appropriate clothing; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.

**Gender expression:** Respect presented.

**Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing; surface must exhibit authentic relief printing characteristics — bold hand-carved linework, slight ink irregularities, cheap newsprint texture.

**Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.

**Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid photographic realism, digital smoothing, academic polish, subtle tonality, halftone dots, figure subordination to environment, empty/minimal compositions, terrifying horror aesthetic.

**Silent validation:** Apply framework requirements, regenerate silently if fail.

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Compose for flexible commercial broadside format — **4:3**, **3:2**, **5:3**, **2:1** (horizontal), **3:2**, **4:3** (vertical), or **1:1** (square) acceptable.

**Note on Ratio Flexibility:** Source image aspect ratios may influence final output. Posada worked across multiple broadside formats for commercial printing flexibility.

Redraw in **Mexican Folk Printmaking / Relief Print style** for **mass-media broadside publication (hoja volante)**.

Identity via caricature silhouette, exaggerated gesture, and satirical costume/prop signifiers — not naturalistic likeness.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original satirical scenes inspired by Mexican popular culture (Day of the Dead traditions, revolutionary politics, social commentary) avoiding copyrighted character elements. No recognizable modern franchise iconography.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `woodblock-carved` — Bold outlines with expressive hatching; caricature/satirical facial proportions if skeleton; exaggerated features if human.

**Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid` or `candid-motion` — Capture figure mid-action: dancing, bicycling, playing music, working, fighting, celebrating.

**Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` or `format-native` — Commercial flexibility across broadside formats.

**Style Dominance:** José Guadalupe Posada's whimsical calavera satire, densely packed compositions, hand-carved relief printing aesthetic, and populist narrative clarity overrides all other stylistic considerations.

**Mode Selector:** Broadside print / Popular media illustration

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**FLEXIBLE RATIO SELECTION (commercial broadside formats):**

**HORIZONTAL FORMATS:**

- `5:3` or `3:2` (standard broadsheet horizontal)
- `2:1` (wide panoramic broadsheet)

**VERTICAL FORMATS:**

- `3:2` or `4:3` (standard broadsheet vertical)

**SQUARE FORMAT:**

- `1:1` (chapbook or contained illustration)

**Note on Format Flexibility:** Source image aspect ratios may influence final output. Posada's commercial work appeared in varied broadside formats optimized for printing economics and narrative needs.

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Adapt composition to suit declared format while maintaining figure dominance and packed density
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figures occupy 60-90% of frame area — backgrounds functional and supporting, never empty or dominant
- **Background Treatment:** Functional contextual settings (cemetery, street, cantina, landscape) that support narrative without overwhelming central action
- **Format Justification:** Flexible formats serve commercial broadside publication for mass-market penny papers, allowing horizontal group scenes, vertical portraits, or square contained narratives

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:**

- Manuel Manilla (predecessor at Vanegas Arroyo press) — popularized calavera as living active figure
- Indigenous Mexican skull motif — prehistoric cultural symbolism reinterpreted for modern satire
- Socio-political environment — Porfirio Díaz dictatorship, Mexican Revolution, rapid modernization
- Commercial mass media — penny broadsides, corridos (narrative songs), sensational news
- Counter-influence: Rejection of European academic polish and refined aesthetics in favor of raw populist expression

**Medium/Production Method:** Relief printing (letterpress) using type-metal engraving, woodcut, wood engraving, or acid-etched zinc plates. High-volume, low-cost commercial printing for mass distribution via broadsides (hojas volantes). Images carved in relief, inked, and pressed into cheap wood-pulp paper often dyed with bright aniline colors (orange, scarlet, green, yellow, magenta). All tones built through bold outlines, parallel hatching, and cross-hatching — no continuous-tone processes. Characteristic imperfections from speed printing: slight ink irregularities, plate impression texture, hand-carved line quality.

**Thematic Purpose:** Social and political satire for mass consumption. Calaveras (skeletons) used as whimsical satirical figures commenting on class distinctions, political hypocrisy, revolutionary politics, and the great equalizer—death. Narrative immediacy for largely illiterate audience requiring instantly legible visual storytelling. Commercial journalism documenting sensational news, crimes, disasters, and popular culture.

**Hallmark Motifs (quantified):**

1. **Calaveras (Skeletons):** Dominant motif — whimsical, expressive skeletons engaged in all human activities (dancing, bicycling, working, fighting). NOT horrific but satirical. Characterized by exaggerated non-naturalistic proportions, elaborate costume signifiers (sombreros, bourgeois hats, work clothes), and dynamic gesture. La Calavera Catrina (skeleton with elaborate feathered hat) most iconic example.
2. **Dense Crowd Compositions:** 70-95% of frame filled with figures and narrative details — horror vacui (fear of empty space). Multiple figures in dynamic interaction, supporting cast filling negative space, props and environmental details packed edge-to-edge.
3. **Dynamic Action:** Constant movement — figures captured mid-dance, mid-stride, mid-gesture. NO static poses. Energy and immediacy prioritized over composed stillness.
4. **Social Caricature:** Exaggerated features and proportions amplify character and social commentary. Costume and props signify class (peasant, bourgeois, revolutionary, worker). Satirical rather than reverential treatment of authority.
5. **Expressive Line Quality:** "Smooth and harmonious" in daily life scenes vs. "harsh and thick" in scenes of violence or denunciation. Hand-carved irregularity evident — NOT mechanical precision.

**Period Framing:** 1888–1913 (Posada's Mexico City years at Vanegas Arroyo press encompassing height of Porfirian era through outbreak of Mexican Revolution)

**Tone Tag:** Whimsical satire, dark comedy, populist immediacy, revolutionary energy, social critique, macabre playfulness, folk narrative

**Production Era Authenticity:** High-volume commercial relief printing for penny broadsides. Visible characteristics: bold hand-carved linework with irregular tool marks, slight ink distribution variations, plate impression texture in cheap wood-pulp paper, aniline-dyed paper color (cream, yellow, pink, orange, green), NO halftone dots, NO photographic grain, NO digital smoothing, NO academic polish.

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Quality & Tool Marks:**

- Bold, energetic, varied line weight (thin contours to thick emphatic strokes)
- Hand-carved relief printing character: irregular tool marks, slight variations in line width, expressive rather than mechanical
- Line density: 15-50 lines per inch for hatching/cross-hatching (coarser than fine wood engraving)
- Style adaptation: "smooth and harmonious" parallel lines for everyday scenes, "harsh and thick" aggressive lines for violence/denunciation
- Bold outlines define all major forms — graphic clarity prioritized
- NO photographic continuous tone; every tonal gradation constructed through visible line density

**Texture & Surface Depth:**

- Parallel hatching for mid-tones: 20-35 lines per inch, following form curvature
- Cross-hatching for shadows: 30-50 lines per inch, perpendicular line networks
- Fabric texture: flowing parallel lines suggesting drape and movement
- Bone texture (skeletons): sharp highlight edges, bold shadow hatching emphasizing contours
- Relief printing impression: slight texture from plate pressed into soft absorbent paper
- Paper substrate texture: cheap wood-pulp newsprint with visible fiber structure

**Edge Treatment & Detail Hierarchy:**

- ALL forms defined by bold outlines — graphic clarity mandatory
- Primary figures: maximum detail with clear feature definition (skull teeth, costume details, facial expressions)
- Secondary figures: moderate detail maintaining legibility
- Background elements: simplified but functional — never vague or atmospheric
- NO atmospheric soft-focus recession — clarity maintained throughout depth
- Detail serves narrative — exaggerated features for satire, costume details for class signification

**Color Mixing Methods:**

- Monochromatic: black ink on colored paper substrate
- Paper color provides "ground tone": cream, pale yellow, pale pink, orange, scarlet, green (aniline-dyed wood-pulp paper)
- NO multicolor printing (except rare chromolithograph exceptions 1899-1901 Maucci series)
- Tonal range through line density: white paper (no ink) → light gray (sparse lines) → medium gray (moderate hatching) → deep black (dense hatching/solid areas)
- Chiaroscuro balance: 40-60% deep blacks (more balanced than Doré's oppressive 60-80%)

**Stroke Economy & Directionality:**

- Every line serves form description, volume modeling, or narrative clarity
- Hatching follows surface topology: curved parallel lines for rounded forms, straight for flat planes
- Cross-hatching angles determined by form intersection and shadow direction
- Bold solid blacks for maximum contrast areas (deep shadows, costume elements, background emphasis)
- Economic use of line — populist clarity over refined academic detail

**Material Simulation & Authenticity:**

- Authentic relief printing characteristics: crisp black ink edges, slight ink spread on absorbent paper
- Hand-carved tool evidence: line width variation from pressure, occasional irregular edges
- Cheap paper absorption: slight ink bleed acceptable, adds authenticity
- Plate impression texture: subtle embossing from printing pressure
- NO digital vector perfection — hand-crafted irregularity required
- Paper context: wood-pulp newsprint (cream/colored), NOT fine art paper or glossy stock

**Pose Anchors:**

- Dynamic action mandatory: NO static standing poses
- Mid-motion capture: dancing (legs lifted, arms extended), bicycling (bent posture, hands on handlebars), working (tool-wielding gesture), fighting (aggressive lean, weapon raised)
- Exaggerated gesture: arms akimbo, legs splayed, heads tilted, spines curved
- Social gesture vocabulary: peasant (bent from labor, simple tool), bourgeois (upright posture, elaborate costume), revolutionary (aggressive stance, weapon), musician (instrument-holding pose)
- Skeleton articulation: flexible, cartoonish joint angles (NOT anatomically rigid)

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:**

- **CRITICAL:** Figures dominate 60-90% of image area (OPPOSITE of Doré's environmental subordination)
- Primary figures: 100% baseline scale, commanding central composition
- Secondary figures: 60-90% primary scale, filling remaining space
- Background architecture/landscape: human-scaled (NOT overwhelming monumental 300-500% scale)
- Compositional density: 70-95% of frame filled — minimal negative space
- Horror vacui principle: packed, crowded compositions rejecting emptiness

**Emotional State Anchor:**

- **REQUIRED:** whimsical, satirical, energetic, playful, defiant, celebratory, mischievous
- **FORBIDDEN:** terrified, overwhelmed, cowering, defensively retreating, victimized, helpless
- Death representation: lively skeletons engaged in human activities, NOT horrific specters
- Satire mode: mocking authority, celebrating folk culture, critiquing social hypocrisy
- Revolutionary energy: defiant, active, engaged — NOT passive or defeated

**Material Authenticity Anchor:**

- All tones created through visible bold linework — outlines, parallel hatching, cross-hatching
- NO continuous-tone photographic gradients, NO digital smoothing, NO academic polish
- Crisp black ink on colored paper substrate with hand-carved line irregularities
- Cheap newsprint texture and aniline dye color foundational to aesthetic

**Detail Hierarchy & Compositional Density (MANDATORY):**

- **NO atmospheric recession** — clarity maintained throughout depth (OPPOSITE of Doré)
- Foreground (primary figures): Maximum detail density 40-50 lines/inch, bold outlines, clear features
- Midground (secondary figures): Moderate detail 30-40 lines/inch, simplified but legible
- Background (context): Functional detail 15-30 lines/inch, supporting narrative without vagueness
- **CRITICAL:** Detail serves narrative clarity, NOT atmospheric depth — populist legibility prioritized
- Frame density: 70-95% filled with figures, objects, narrative elements — reject empty space

**Period Consistency Anchor:**

- 1888-1913 Mexican commercial relief printing technology
- Broadside (hoja volante) mass-media format
- Cheap wood-pulp paper with aniline dye coloring
- High-speed letterpress reproduction characteristics

**Production Method Anchor:**

- Relief printing: only raised carved surfaces receive ink
- Bold black ink on colored paper — slight ink spread from absorbent substrate
- Hand-carved plate texture: irregular line quality, tool mark evidence
- Speed printing imperfections: acceptable minor ink variations, registration marks

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:**

- Flexible format composition: horizontal group scenes, vertical portraits, square contained narratives
- Figure dominance regardless of format: 60-90% figure area maintained
- Packed density across all ratios: minimal negative space universally
- Format optimized for commercial broadside publication and mass distribution

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks:**

**Mexican Folk/Peasant Track (primary for popular scenes):**

- Simple cotton clothing, sarapes (striped blankets), rebozos (shawls)
- Period: 1880s-1910s rural/urban working class Mexico
- Fabric: Plain cotton, simple stripes, functional work wear
- Construction: Loose-fitting garments, rope belts, practical footwear

**Bourgeois/Dandy Track (for satirical class critique):**

- Elaborate hats (European fashion), formal suits, fancy dresses
- Period: Porfirian era (1876-1911) upper-class fashion
- Fabric: Fine textiles suggested through clean surfaces vs. working-class hatching
- Construction: Fitted garments, decorative elements, status signifiers

**Revolutionary Track (for political scenes):**

- Military-style clothing, bandoliers, work clothes with weapons
- Period: 1910-1920 Mexican Revolution
- Fabric: Rugged practical textiles, leather accessories
- Construction: Functional military/guerrilla style, ammunition belts

**Calavera Costume Track (for skeleton scenes):**

- Skeletons wear human clothing appropriate to social class/role
- Elaborate hats PRIMARY signifier: sombrero (peasant), feathered hat (bourgeois dandy—La Catrina), top hat (European elite), simple cap (worker)
- Clothing defines skeleton's satirical role: sarape (peasant), suit (bourgeois), military gear (revolutionary), work clothes (laborer)

**Fabric Behavior:**

- Bold outline definition with interior parallel line hatching suggesting drape
- Flowing movement lines for dynamic action (dancing, running, wind)
- Striped patterns (sarapes, ribbed fabrics) rendered with parallel lines
- Contrast between smooth bourgeois fabrics (minimal hatching) and textured peasant fabrics (dense hatching)

**Accessory Caps:** 2-4 accessories typical (hats, instruments, weapons, bottles, tools)

- Allowable: Elaborate hats (PRIMARY), musical instruments, work tools, bottles, weapons, cigarettes, fans
- Props define social role and satirical commentary

**Color Palette Restrictions:**

- Monochromatic rendering: black ink on colored paper substrate
- Paper color provides chromatic element: cream, yellow, pink, orange, scarlet, green
- NO multicolor ink printing (except rare chromolithograph exceptions)
- Clothing differentiation through tonal value (line density) and bold outline rather than color

**Wardrobe Variation Required:**

- Vary social class costumes between iterations: peasant sarape → bourgeois suit → revolutionary bandolier
- Cycle through hat styles: sombrero → feathered bourgeois hat → top hat → worker's cap
- Maintain 1888-1913 Mexican period consistency across all wardrobe choices

**Props (2-4 typical for Posada's narrative density):**

**YAML Prop Pool — Mexican Popular Culture Context:**

```yaml
hero_props:
  - elaborate_hat:
      description: "Sombrero, feathered bourgeois hat (Catrina), top hat, worker's cap"
      scale: 80-150% head size (exaggerated for satire)
      rendering: bold outline, hatching for texture/shadow, PRIMARY class signifier
      
  - musical_instrument:
      description: "Guitar, violin, trumpet, accordion"
      scale: proportional to figure
      rendering: simplified functional form, bold outline, minimal interior detail
      
  - bottle_drink:
      description: "Pulque bottle, aguardiente, beer, tequila"
      scale: 30-50cm typical bottle
      rendering: simple cylindrical form, label suggested, held in hand
      
  - weapon:
      description: "Rifle, pistol, knife, machete"
      scale: proportional to historical weapons
      rendering: bold outline emphasizing threatening silhouette
      
  - work_tool:
      description: "Shovel, hoe, hammer, sickle"
      scale: functional tool size
      rendering: simplified recognizable form, labor signifier

secondary_props:
  - bicycle:
      description: "Penny-farthing or early safety bicycle"
      scale: functional bicycle proportions
      rendering: wheel spokes as radiating lines, bold frame outline
      
  - furniture:
      description: "Table, chair, barrel, coffin"
      scale: functional furniture size
      rendering: simplified geometric forms, functional context
      
  - papers_text:
      description: "Broadsides, newspapers, letters, books"
      scale: handheld document size
      rendering: rectangular form with suggested text lines
      
  - skull_bones:
      description: "Ground skulls for cemetery scenes"
      scale: 10-15cm skulls
      rendering: simplified skull form, bold eye sockets, grinning teeth
      
  - small_objects:
      description: "Cigarettes, coins, flowers, rosaries"
      scale: 5-15cm objects
      rendering: economical simplified forms, narrative signifiers
```

**Coherence Filter:** All wardrobe and props must support 1888-1913 Mexican popular culture aesthetic serving satirical social commentary, Day of the Dead traditions, revolutionary politics, and folk narrative. If period consistency unclear, default to simple peasant attire with sombrero allowing satirical skeleton characterization to dominate.

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS (Flexible Broadside Formats):**

**HORIZONTAL FORMATS (5:3, 3:2, 2:1):**

- Group scenes: multiple figures in lateral arrangement
- Parade/procession compositions: left-to-right narrative flow
- Crowd scenes: densely packed horizontal bands of action
- Figure distribution: 60-90% coverage across width

**VERTICAL FORMATS (3:2, 4:3 portrait):**

- Single figure or paired figures emphasis
- Vertical stacking: figure over contextual ground
- Portrait orientation: elaborate hat/costume emphasis
- Figure dominance: 60-90% vertical frame occupation

**SQUARE FORMAT (1:1):**

- Centered figure or tight group
- Radial composition around central action
- Contained narrative scene
- Dense edge-to-edge fill: 70-95%

**Note on Format Flexibility:** Source image ratios may influence output. All formats prioritize figure dominance and packed density over environmental vastness.

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**Perspective Regime:**

- Flattened populist perspective: narrative clarity prioritized over academic spatial depth
- Non-systematic spatial logic: figures and objects arranged for maximum legibility
- Expressive distortion acceptable: scale exaggeration for satire, perspective compression for density
- Eye-level viewpoint predominant: direct engagement with viewer
- NO atmospheric recession — clarity maintained throughout depth

**Figure:Ground Ratio:**

- **Figure-dominant composition MANDATORY:** 60-90% figures/action, 10-40% background context
- **OPPOSITE of Doré:** Figures command space rather than subordinate to environment
- Central figures: maximum scale and detail
- Secondary figures: fill remaining space, create density
- Background: functional supporting context, NEVER empty or vast

**Density Percentage:**

- High visual density universal: 70-95% of frame filled with narrative elements
- Horror vacui principle: reject empty space, pack frame edge-to-edge
- Multiple figures, props, background details create vibrant crowded energy
- Minimal negative space: only functional breathing room between elements

**Lighting Logic:**

- Graphic contrast prioritized over naturalistic lighting
- Bold blacks and white paper create high-contrast clarity
- NO single dramatic light source (unlike Doré)
- Functional shading: hatching indicates volume and form, NOT atmospheric mood
- **Chiaroscuro balance:** 40-60% deep blacks (more balanced than Doré's oppressive 60-80%)
- Lighting serves legibility — populist clarity over dramatic atmosphere

**Detail:Negative Space Ratio:**

- Primary figures: 70-95% detail coverage with bold outlines and hatching
- Secondary figures: 60-80% detail coverage maintaining legibility
- Background: 40-60% functional detail supporting narrative
- **NO atmospheric recession** — detail serves clarity throughout depth
- Negative space: 5-30% maximum (only functional gaps between elements)

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:**

- Cheap wood-pulp newsprint with aniline dye coloring
- Paper colors: cream, pale yellow, pale pink, orange, scarlet, green, magenta
- Absorbent substrate texture: slight ink spread, fibrous paper structure
- Broadside (hoja volante) ephemeral publication context
- NOT fine art paper, NOT glossy modern stock

**Frame/Band Anchor:**

- OMIT decorative borders and aestheticizing framing devices
- Image may have simple linear border (printing plate edge) but NO elaborate ornamentation
- Typography (if present) integrated as compositional element, not decorative addition
- Reject European "high finish" framing conventions

**Production Context Anchor:**

- 1888-1913 Mexican commercial letterpress printing
- High-volume, low-cost broadside production
- Relief printing characteristics: plate impression texture, hand-carved line quality
- Speed printing imperfections: acceptable ink variations, slight registration drift

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:**

- Composition optimized for declared format (horizontal group, vertical portrait, square contained)
- Figure dominance maintained across all ratios: 60-90% figure area universal
- Packed density regardless of format: 70-95% frame filled
- Format serves commercial broadside flexibility, not artistic hierarchy

**ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENT (Background Options):**

**Cemetery Settings (for calavera scenes):**

- Tombstones, crosses, ground skulls
- Simplified architectural forms with bold outlines
- Functional context supporting skeleton narrative
- Human-scaled elements (NOT monumental overwhelming architecture)

**Urban Settings (for social/political scenes):**

- Street architecture, buildings, trains, modern technology
- Simplified geometric forms indicating context
- Crowd elements filling space
- Revolutionary/modern Mexico City environment

**Rural/Landscape Settings (for peasant/worker scenes):**

- Simplified vegetation, mountains, agave plants
- Functional ground plane with textural hatching
- Agricultural tools, buildings suggesting context
- Traditional rural Mexico

**Interior Settings (for cantina/domestic scenes):**

- Tables, barrels, architectural elements
- Props indicating function (bottles, instruments, furniture)
- Walls with simple hatching, floor with linear perspective
- Crowded intimate spaces

**Mood Amplification:**

- Backgrounds support satirical narrative, NOT atmospheric mood
- Settings indicate social context (cemetery = death commentary, cantina = popular culture, landscape = peasant life)
- Functional clarity over emotional atmosphere
- Populist legibility: viewers instantly read location and context

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** OMIT — No text, titles, headlines, or typography within the illustration.

**Rationale:** Although authentic Posada broadsides entwined image and sensational typography, this framework delivers text-free illustration plates for modern reuse. Keep the composition purely pictorial unless a dedicated typography workflow is introduced.

**Historical Context (Reference Only):** Traditional broadsides featured bold headline type above the image, narrative corrido columns below, and eclectic Victorian-era display faces set by letterpress. Typeface energy and illustration worked together as a single graphic unit.

**If Text Were Authorized (Reference Only):**
- Headline zone above the image, story columns below.
- Copy limits: headline ≤8 words; corrido text sized to fit below.
- Period fonts: late 19th-century Mexican letterpress display faces, condensed wood type, slab serifs.
- Hierarchy: headline dominates; mixed weights and condensed styles create carnival energy.

**Current Specification:** Follow user directive—omit all typography and deliver a clean illustration ready for separate layout work.
