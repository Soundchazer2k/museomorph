# Gustave Doré Gothic Horror Framework

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.

**Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.

**Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette, gesture, and expression unless photographic.

**Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("20-80 lines per square inch cross-hatching," "figures occupy <30% of image area") override descriptive language.

**Process-Over-Result Priority:** How engraving tools create marks supersedes visual appearance descriptions.

**Material Physics Authority:** Wood-engraving tool limitations, end-grain hardwood characteristics, and ink-on-paper binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` — Fine parallel and cross-hatched lines build all facial tones; no photographic gradation.

**Pose Flags:** `gestural-fluid`, `psychological-tension`, `contorted-psychological` — Theatrical poses captured at moment of maximum narrative drama.

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` — Recompose entirely for declared vertical portrait ratio.

**Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.

**Text policy:** Omit all text unless Section 8 authorizes.

**Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore beyond period-appropriate biblical/literary horror context; no real logos/watermarks/signatures.

**Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest period-appropriate clothing; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.

**Gender expression:** Respect presented.

**Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic wood-engraving characteristics — visible directional linework creating all tones.

**Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.

**Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid photographic realism, digital smoothing, halftone dots, flat even lighting, static minimalist compositions.

**Silent validation:** Apply framework requirements, regenerate silently if fail.

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to **2:3 ratio** (primary) or **3:4 ratio** (alternative) — ignore source image dimensions completely.

Redraw in **19th-Century French Romantic Illustration / Wood-Engraving style** for **mass-publication book illustration plate**.

Identity via silhouette, gesture, and dramatic expression — not photographic likeness.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original gothic horror scene inspired by literary traditions (Dante, Milton, Biblical narratives) avoiding copyrighted character elements. No recognizable modern horror franchise iconography.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` — All facial features constructed through visible parallel and cross-hatched engraving lines.

**Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` or `contorted-psychological` — Capture figure at moment of supernatural awe, terror, or spiritual revelation.

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` — Entirely new composition optimized for vertical 2:3 or 3:4 format.

**Style Dominance:** Gustave Doré's dramatic chiaroscuro, theatrical gestures, and overwhelmed-human-in-sublime-environment aesthetic overrides all other stylistic considerations.

**Mode Selector:** Gallery print / Book illustration plate

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- Primary: `2:3` (standard vertical portrait for biblical/literary horror scenes)
- Alternative: `3:4` (classical portrait orientation for book illustration)

**Note on Ratio Flexibility:** Source image aspect ratios may influence final output. While target ratios are specified above, variations within the vertical portrait family (2:3 to 3:4 range) maintain authentic Doré proportions.

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely — design new vertical composition from ground up
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned in lower-to-middle third, allowing vast supernatural/architectural environment to dominate upper 60-70% of frame
- **Background Treatment:** Extend dramatic atmospheric environment (vast caverns, turbulent skies, decaying architecture, sublime landscapes) to fill entire vertical canvas with environmental hostility
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 or 3:4 vertical ratio serves Doré's signature compositional strategy of dwarfing human figures within overwhelming sublime environments, maximizing vertical space for towering architecture, cosmic visions, or oppressive darkness

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:**

- Literary sources: Dante Alighieri's *Divine Comedy*, John Milton's *Paradise Lost*, Biblical narratives, Lord Byron, Edgar Allan Poe
- Romantic movement emphasis on sublime, grotesque, emotional intensity over classical restraint
- 19th-century French illustration traditions serving mass-market book publication

**Medium/Production Method:** Wood-engraving on end-grain hardwood (typically boxwood) for industrial mass reproduction. Doré drew designs directly onto woodblocks; teams of skilled artisan engravers (including Héliodore Pisan) carved the relief surfaces. Final prints produced via electrotype process on high-speed cylinder presses, creating affordable illustrated books for global distribution. All tones built through parallel lines, cross-hatching, and stippling — no continuous-tone photographic processes.

**Thematic Purpose:** Transform epic literary narratives into powerful visual statements championing emotion, imagination, supernatural wonder, and psychological terror. Visualize humanity's fragility when confronting divine majesty, infernal punishment, or cosmic forces beyond comprehension.

**Hallmark Motifs (quantified):**

1. **Overwhelmed Human Figure:** Human subjects occupy <30% of total image area in 64% of horror compositions, dwarfed by sublime landscapes, immense architecture, or overwhelming supernatural events
2. **Dramatic Chiaroscuro:** Deep blacks dominate 60-80% of image area; single dramatic light source creates extreme tonal contrast in 71% of compositions
3. **Theatrical Gestures:** Figures rendered in dynamic, contorted poses conveying intense movement — arms raised in supplication, bodies twisted in despair, captured at narrative climax
4. **Grotesque Supernatural Beings:** Demons, death personifications, monstrous hybrids, angels rendered at 150-200% human scale with same material authenticity as natural elements
5. **Environmental Hostility:** Settings convey danger through monumental scale, oppressive darkness, architectural decay, or turbulent natural forces in 90% of horror scenes

**Period Framing:** 1850–1883 (peak productive years encompassing *Don Quixote* 1863, *The Bible* 1866, *Paradise Lost* 1866, *Divine Comedy* illustrations, *London: A Pilgrimage* 1872, *The Raven* 1883)

**Tone Tag:** Sublime gothic horror, psychological dread, supernatural awe, romantic grandeur, theatrical intensity, biblical gravitas

**Production Era Authenticity:** Industrial wood-engraving reproduction for mass-market book publication. Visible characteristics: energetic networks of fine linework, cross-hatching building all tones, high-contrast black ink on cream/white paper stock, sharp foreground detail transitioning to atmospheric soft-focus backgrounds. Explicitly forbid: halftone dots, photographic grain, digital smoothing, modern printing artifacts.

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line Quality & Tool Marks:**

- Cross-hatching density ranges 20-80 lines per square inch depending on tonal requirements
- Visible individual line strokes in highlight areas; dense interwoven networks in shadow zones
- Lines follow form topology: parallel curved lines for fabric draping, radiating lines for light emanation, irregular cross-hatch for rock texture
- Burin and graver tool marks visible in line consistency and precision
- NO photographic continuous tone; every tonal gradation constructed through visible line density modulation

**Texture & Surface Depth:**

- Rock surfaces: irregular cross-hatching with varied line angles, 40-60 lines per square inch
- Fabric/drapery: parallel flow lines following fold topology, 30-50 lines per square inch
- Flesh tones: minimal linework in highlights, subtle cross-hatching in shadows, tonal modeling through line density
- Atmospheric effects: widely-spaced parallel lines transitioning to pure white paper in brightest areas
- Wood-engraving relief printing produces crisp black ink on white paper with no plate tone

**Edge Treatment & Detail Hierarchy:**

- Foreground elements: 100% sharp defined edges with maximum detail precision (individual fingers, fabric folds, facial features)
- Midground: detail reduction of approximately 60% from foreground clarity
- Background: atmospheric soft edges, pure tonal gradation with minimal linework (70% soft focus treatment)
- Sharp focus zone occupies 30-40% of total image depth, creating powerful depth through selective clarity

**Color Mixing Methods:**

- Monochromatic: black ink on white/cream paper only
- Tonal range constructed entirely through line density: pure white (no lines) → light gray (sparse lines 10-20/inch) → medium gray (moderate cross-hatch 30-50/inch) → deep black (dense cross-hatch 60-80+/inch)
- Chiaroscuro dominance: 60-80% of image area rendered in dark tones (60+ lines/inch density)
- NO color, NO halftone dots, NO photographic grain

**Stroke Economy & Directionality:**

- Every mark serves form description or tonal modeling — no decorative linework
- Directional line flow mandatory: follow surface topology, never arbitrary
- Light source dictates shadow hatching angles: perpendicular to light rays, following form curvature
- Parallel line clusters create texture identity: horizontal for calm water, chaotic angles for turbulent elements

**Material Simulation & Authenticity:**

- Authentic wood-engraving characteristics: crisp black ink, slight paper texture absorption, occasional printing registration marks acceptable
- Surface must show tool-mark evidence: parallel graver strokes, controlled line width consistency
- Reject digital vector perfection: subtle line weight variation from tool pressure authentic
- Paper context: cream or white book-quality stock, not glossy modern coated paper

**Pose Anchors:**

- Head tilt: 15-45 degrees from vertical in moments of psychological stress or supernatural awe
- Shoulder-hip angle differential: 20-60 degrees creating dynamic contrapposto or twisted psychological tension
- Weight distribution: often imbalanced (70-30% split) suggesting instability, motion, or emotional turmoil
- Gesture economy: arms raised in supplication/defense, hands grasping at air/fabric, fingers splayed in emotional intensity
- Expression hierarchy: eyes and mouth receive highest detail precision for psychological communication

**Emotional State Anchor (CRITICAL):**

- **REQUIRED:** defensive, overwhelmed, terrified, supplicant, vulnerable, awestruck, cowering
- **FORBIDDEN:** commanding, triumphant, confident, powerful, in control, victorious, celebratory
- Arms raised = plea for mercy/divine intervention, NOT gesture of power or celebration
- Facial expression = fear/awe/desperation, NOT joy/confidence/serenity
- Body language = retreating/bracing/shielding, NOT advancing/conquering/welcoming

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:**

- Human figures: baseline 100% scale
- Supernatural beings: 150-200% human scale (demons, angels, death personifications)
- Architecture/environment: 300-500% human scale creating overwhelming monumentality
- **CRITICAL:** Architecture must dwarf figures — minimum 3× human height, ideal 4-5× human height
- Compositional subordination: human elements occupy 20-30% of image area (strict maximum 35%)
- Viewer perspective should feel figure is small/vulnerable relative to setting scale

**Material Authenticity Anchor:**

- All tones created through visible directional linework — parallel lines, cross-hatching, stippling
- NO continuous-tone photographic gradients, NO digital smoothing
- Crisp black ink on white paper with clear line boundaries
- Tool mark evidence visible in line consistency and precision

**Period Consistency Anchor:**

- 1850-1883 wood-engraving industrial printing technology
- End-grain hardwood block (typically boxwood) relief printing characteristics
- Electrotype reproduction allowing mass publication
- Book illustration plate context: single-page vertical format

**Production Method Anchor:**

- Wood-engraving relief printing: only raised surfaces receive ink
- High-contrast black ink on paper — no plate tone, no ink variation
- Sharp detail possible through end-grain engraving vs. softer woodcut cross-grain
- Cylinder press reproduction for mass book publication

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:**

- Vertical 3:4 composition maximizes environmental dominance over human figures
- Lower-third figure placement allows vast architectural/atmospheric space above
- Dramatic vertical perspective lines draw eye upward toward sublime/horrific elements
- Format optimized for full-page book illustration commanding reader's attention

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks:**

**Biblical/Classical Track (primary for gothic horror):**

- Flowing robes, tunics, cloaks with dramatic drapery
- Period: Ancient Mediterranean/Biblical/Medieval fantasy
- Fabric: Heavy wool, linen suggesting weight and substantial draping
- Construction: Simple gathered garments, rope belts, hood constructions

**Fabric Behavior:**

- Heavy draping with deep parallel fold lines suggesting substantial weight
- Wind/motion effects: fabric streaming dramatically in supernatural atmospheric disturbances
- Light interaction: highlight ridges sharp, shadow valleys dense cross-hatching
- Period accuracy: Pre-industrial hand-woven textiles with natural drape characteristics

**Accessory Caps:** Minimalist 0-2 accessories maximum

- Allowable: staff/walking stick, rope belt, simple headwear, religious symbols
- Forbidden: ornate jewelry, complex armor details, anachronistic modern elements

**Color Palette Restrictions:**

- Monochromatic rendering only: pure white (highlight), light gray (sparse lines), medium gray (moderate cross-hatch), deep black (dense lines)
- Fabric tonal range: mid-tones for primary garments allowing both highlight and shadow definition
- No color information — all garment differentiation through tonal value and texture pattern

**Wardrobe Variation Required:**

- Vary garment tonal values between iterations: alternate light-valued robes (sparse linework) with dark-valued cloaks (dense cross-hatching)
- Cycle through period-appropriate silhouettes: simple tunic, draped toga, hooded cloak, tattered robes
- Maintain biblical/classical/medieval fantasy period consistency

**Props (1 hero + optional 1 micro, total ≤2):**

**YAML Prop Pool — Gothic Horror Biblical/Literary Context:**

```yaml
hero_props:
  - staff_walking_stick:
      description: "Wooden walking staff, gnarled texture"

  - scattered_objects:
      description: "Books, vessels, small debris"
      scale: 5-15cm each
      rendering: atmospheric detail suggesting narrative context
```

**Coherence Filter:** All wardrobe and props must support 1850s Romantic literary illustration aesthetic serving biblical/epic poetry/gothic horror narratives. If period consistency unclear, default to simple draped garments and minimal props allowing environmental drama to dominate.

- Avoid "realistic," "photographic," "lifelike" — these trigger wrong rendering approach
- Use instead: "dramatic," "theatrical," "sublime," "overwhelming," "psychological," "supernatural," "intense," "monumental"

------

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS (2:3 or 3:4 Vertical Portrait):**

- **Vertical emphasis:** Maximize upward compositional force — towering architecture, vast skies, overwhelming supernatural presence
- **Subject dominance:** Human figure(s) occupy 20-35% of total image area (target 20-30%), positioned lower-to-middle third
- **Hierarchical staging:** Primary figure → secondary environmental elements → atmospheric background recession
- **Environmental dominance:** Setting commands 65-80% visual weight, creating psychological pressure on human elements

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**Perspective Regime:**

- Strong linear perspective in 57% of horror compositions: converging architectural lines, receding landscape elements
- Atmospheric perspective in 43%: tonal gradation creating depth through line density reduction
- Low-angle viewpoint (15-30 degree upward tilt): emphasizes monumentality, makes viewer vulnerable
- High-angle viewpoint (15-30 degree downward tilt): omniscient observer position for scenes of judgment/damnation
- Eye-level viewpoint: direct psychological confrontation with supernatural threats

**Figure:Ground Ratio:**

- Ground-dominant composition: 65-80% environmental setting, 20-35% human figures
- Target range for horror/sublime scenes: figures occupy 20-30% (ideal), acceptable range extends to 35%
- Figure placement: lower-third to mid-frame positioning, allowing vertical environmental expansion
- Scale subordination: architectural/natural/supernatural elements rendered at 300-500% human scale

**Density Percentage:**

- High visual density in foreground: 70-100% of available space filled with detailed elements
- Medium density in midground: 40-60% detail fill, selective focus on narrative elements
- Low density in background: 10-30% atmospheric suggestion, pure tonal gradation

**Lighting Logic:**

- Single dramatic light source in 71% of compositions: divine radiance, torch, moonlight, supernatural emanation
- Light angle: 30-60 degrees from horizontal, creating strong shadow definition
- Chiaroscuro priority: maximum tonal contrast serving emotional intensity
- Radiating light pattern: straight parallel lines emanating from source point
- Shadow construction: cross-hatching perpendicular to light rays, following form curvature

**Detail:Negative Space Ratio:**

- Foreground (sharp focus zone): 80-100% detail density
- Midground: 40-60% detail density with selective clarity
- Background: 10-30% detail density, atmospheric tonal gradation
- Pure white highlights: 5-15% of total image area for dramatic contrast
- Deep black shadows: 60-80% of total image area for psychological oppression

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:**

- Cream or white book-quality paper stock (not glossy coated modern paper)
- Wood-engraving relief print characteristics: crisp black ink, slight paper texture absorption
- Book illustration plate context: single-page vertical format for mass-publication illustrated literature
- Viewing distance: 30-50cm (typical book reading distance), detail scaled accordingly

**Frame/Band Anchor:**

- OMIT entirely — no decorative borders, no title bands, no marginal ornamentation
- Image extends to edge of page (bleed) or maintains simple rectangular boundary
- Any text (title/caption) placed separately below image, not integrated within composition

**Production Context Anchor:**

- 1850-1883 industrial wood-engraving technology
- Electrotype reproduction process for mass printing
- High-speed cylinder press output on book-quality paper stock
- Characteristic artifacts: occasional slight printing registration variation, crisp black ink boundaries

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:**

- Composition designed specifically for 3:4 vertical format — not adapted from different ratio
- Vertical perspective lines emphasize portrait orientation
- Environmental elements scaled to fill vertical canvas maximally
- Lower-third figure placement optimized for vertical storytelling hierarchy

**ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENT (Background Options):**

**Architectural Settings:**

- Vast Gothic cathedrals, decaying ruins, cyclopean structures, infernal architecture
- Strong linear perspective with converging verticals emphasizing height
- Detail hierarchy: sharp foreground stonework, atmospheric distant arches
- Scale: 400-500% human height creating overwhelming monumentality

**Landscape Settings:**

- Turbulent skies with dramatic cloud formations rendered in flowing parallel lines
- Rocky chasms, mountain precipices, barren wastelands
- Atmospheric depth through line density reduction: foreground 60-80 lines/inch, background 10-20 lines/inch
- Scale: vast horizontal/vertical expanse dwarfing human figures

**Supernatural Settings:**

- Cosmic visions: radiating light patterns, swirling vortices of angels/demons
- Underworld caverns: dense cross-hatched shadows, occasional light source
- Ethereal spaces: minimal environmental detail, figures suspended in tonal atmosphere

**Mood Amplification:**

- Settings actively participate in narrative, not passive backdrops
- Environmental hostility: oppressive darkness, threatening scale, decaying structures
- Psychological pressure: vast empty spaces isolating figures, overwhelming architectural weight
- Supernatural atmosphere: impossible geometries, divine/infernal presences, cosmic scale

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** OMIT — No text, titles, captions, or typography within image composition.

**Rationale:** Following 19th-century book illustration conventions, Doré's illustrations were presented as full-page plates with any titles or captions placed separately below the image in the margin, not integrated within the artwork itself. This preserves visual purity and allows dramatic composition to command full attention.

**If Text Were Authorized (for reference only):**

- **Ratio-Appropriate Zones:** Lower margin below image, never overlapping illustration
- **Copy Limits:** ≤6 words for title/caption
- **Period-Appropriate Typography:** 19th-century serif typeface consistent with book printing conventions
- **Font Recommendation:** Closest match would be traditional book serif faces like Caslon, Baskerville, or similar old-style serifs used in 1850-1880s publishing. However, specific font matching not required as text is OMITTED from composition.

**Format-Specific Text Rules:**

- **Gallery Print Mode:** Omit all text — pure illustration
- **Museum Context:** Optional caption below image in traditional serif typeface
- **Book Illustration Plate:** Title/caption in margin below image, separate from composition

**Historical Accuracy:** Typography must match 1850-1883 letterpress printing technology if included. Traditional serif faces, not modern sans-serif or display fonts.

**Production Method Integration:** If text present, render with period-appropriate letterpress characteristics: slight ink spread, crisp edges, traditional book typography spacing and hierarchy.
