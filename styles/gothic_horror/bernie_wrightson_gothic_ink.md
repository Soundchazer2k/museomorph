about: >
  Bernie Wrightson crosshatched nightmares until the ink looked alive‚Äîrotting
  architecture, tortured anatomy, and candlelit chiaroscuro that would make Poe
  shiver. His Frankenstein portfolio set the bar for dramatic linework.
  MuseoMorph carries that operatic dread into new crypts, laboratories, and
  cursed bloodlines.

# Bernie Wrightson Gothic Horror Illustration Style Prompt

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1‚Üí8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `engrave-hatch` with `skeletal-gauntness` and `haunted-eyes`
- **Pose Flags:** `gestural-fluid`, `contorted-agony`, `spectral-glide`, `psychological-tension`
- **Canvas Control Flags:** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`
- **Material Physics Authority:** Bristol board substrate, india ink, and Gillott 291 nib specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Gothic Horror Authorization:** Emphasis on psychological terror, spectral encounters, and existential dread through atmosphere and suggestion rather than explicit content.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately unsettling or melancholic aesthetics when historically accurate to gothic horror tradition.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures. Emphasis on atmosphere and psychological impact.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.

------

## üìã Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[declared ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Bernie Wrightson Gothic Horror Pen-and-Ink Style** for **detailed book illustration format**.
- Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression with psychological dread and spectral presence.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original gothic horror designs avoiding copyrighted elements, focusing on universal themes of mortality, decay, and supernatural dread.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `engrave-hatch` with `skeletal-gauntness` and `haunted-eyes`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` or `spectral-glide`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Wrightson's theatrical literary horror illustration with emphasis on the grotesque and supernatural supersedes photographic realism.
- **Mode Selector:** Gothic horror book illustration for macabre narrative visualization.

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

**PORTRAIT FORMATS (preferred for character-focused horror):**

- `2:3` (classic book illustration / literary horror scenes)
- `3:4` (portrait study / character focus)
- `4:5` (modern poster format for dramatic impact)

**LANDSCAPE FORMATS (for environmental horror):**

- `4:3` (classical landscape with gothic architecture)
- `16:9` (cinematic horror panorama)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** extend-background with atmospheric fog or decay
- **Spatial Allocation:** Tormented figure placement with diminishing hope, supporting grotesque elements
- **Background Treatment:** Fill with suffocating cross-hatched environments, decaying architecture, or spectral mists extending to full canvas
- **Format Justification:** Ratio serves theatrical staging of gothic horror narrative

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** German Expressionism, Romantic horror literature (Poe, Shelley), Medieval danse macabre, Gustave Dor√© engraving tradition, EC Comics horror atmosphere
- **Medium/Production method:** Authentic pen-and-ink on bristol board using Gillott 291 nib with india ink, emphasizing cross-hatching and line weight variation rather than solid black fills
- **Thematic purpose:** Dramatic visualization of existential horror, spectral encounters, moral decay, and psychological terror with literary grandeur
- **5 hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**
  - Monumental figure scale at 120-150% naturalistic proportions for heroic gothic presence
  - Intricate cross-hatching patterns creating rich tonal gradation from pure white to deep black through line density variation
  - Decaying architectural grandeur with crumbling Gothic elements and skeletal details
  - Atmospheric perspective achieved through line density variation (3-5mm spacing for distance, 1mm for foreground)
  - Theatrical chiaroscuro with single dramatic light source creating stark white highlights against consuming shadows
- **Period framing:** 1970s horror comic illustration with literary classical influence
- **Tone Tag:** Ominous, psychologically unsettling, grotesquely dramatic, melancholic, theatrically macabre

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Line quality:** Gillott 291 nib characteristics with variable pressure creating 0.2-1.5mm line weights, authentic india ink flow with slight bleeding on bristol board texture
- **Cross-hatching specifications:** Primary hatching at 45¬∞ angles, secondary crosshatch at 135¬∞, tertiary hatching at 90¬∞ for deepest blacks, line spacing 0.5-3mm depending on tonal value
- **Surface simulation:** Bristol board tooth creating slight ink catch and organic line variation, no digital smoothing
- **Edge treatment:** Confident contour lines with selective lost edges in shadow areas, emphasis on silhouette clarity
- **Atmospheric technique:** Line density variation for depth - 80% detail density foreground, 40% middle ground, 15% background with pure white fade-outs
- **Material simulation:** Authentic pen-and-ink characteristics with no brush work or solid black fills
- **Scale proportions:** Heroic gothic proportions with possible anatomical elongation for spectral beings (neck elongation 120%, limb extension 110%)
- **Detail hierarchy:** Primary subject 100% detail resolution, secondary elements 60%, atmospheric elements 30%

------
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

- **Wardrobe tracks:** Tattered Victorian/Edwardian garments, decaying aristocratic attire, burial shrouds, monastic robes with period-accurate construction showing decay and age
- **Fabric behavior:** Heavy drapery with dramatic folds appearing torn, weathered, or ethereal with authentic textile physics
- **Accessory caps:** Elaborate 3-4 accessories supporting gothic horror narrative context
- **Color palette:** Pure black and white with full tonal range - no color, emphasizing dramatic contrast
- **Wardrobe variation:** Cycle through: tattered black cloaks, ghostly white shrouds, ceremonial garments showing decay, skeletal remnants, Victorian mourning dress
- **Props:** 1 hero + 1 micro prop maximum from gothic horror vocabulary
- **Coherence filter:** All elements support gothic horror/supernatural narrative with implied folkloric authenticity

**YAML Props Pool:**

```yaml
gothic_horror: [ornate_candelabra, human_skull_weathered, rusted_chains, broken_crucifix, spectral_lantern, withered_roses, open_tome_ancient, perched_raven]
decaying_architecture: [crumbling_archway, moss_covered_gargoyle, shattered_stained_glass, leaning_tombstone, twisted_ironwork]

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**‚ùå Canvas Negatives (‚â•2):**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "unmodified framing"
- "cheerfulness", "harmony", "conventional beauty", "optimistic lighting", "cleanliness", "modern digital effects"
- "solid black fills", "brush work", "painted textures", "color application"

**‚úÖ Canvas Positives (‚â•2):**

- "exactly [declared ratio]", "recomposed for gothic horror illustration"

**WRIGHTSON-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective:** Theatrical staging with dramatic viewpoints emphasizing psychological impact, often low angles for imposing gothic presence
- **Grid/Symmetry:** Classical composition with gothic architectural framework, balanced asymmetry creating tension
- **Figure:ground:** 70:30 with dense cross-hatching detail contrasting strategic white space for spectral effects
- **Density:** 85% detail saturation with selective simplification for atmospheric fade
- **Lighting logic:** Single dramatic light source (candle, moon, fireplace) creating strong chiaroscuro with pure white highlights emphasizing form against consuming darkness
- **Detail:negative space:** 80:20 ratio - intricate cross-hatching detail with strategic white space for moments of stark terror or spectral manifestation

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context:** Bristol board surface characteristics with authentic pen-and-ink relief, hints of paper aging appropriate to gothic literary tradition
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely - no decorative frames outside the illustration
- **Production Context:** 1970s horror comic book illustration methods with period-appropriate line art reproduction quality
- **Ratio Enforcement:** Composition designed specifically for declared ratio with gothic architectural elements supporting the format

------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)
