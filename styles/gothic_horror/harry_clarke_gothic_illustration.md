about: >
  Harry Clarke ornamented Poe and Perrault with razor-thin ink, jeweled color,
  and Gothic filigree that feels like leaded glass. His figures float amid
  patterns sharp enough to cut. MuseoMorph sustains that iridescent menace while
  unveiling new fables, saints, and sinuous borders.

# Harry Clarke Gothic Horror Illustration Style Prompt

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1‚Üí8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` with `stained-glass-lead` integration and `stippling-texture`
- **Pose Flags:** `hieratic-formal`, `gestural-fluid`, `psychological-tension`
- **Canvas Control Flags:** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`
- **Material Physics Authority:** Bristol board substrate, India ink, and dip pen specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Stained Glass Integration:** Emphasis on lead line aesthetic, rich pattern integration, and illuminated manuscript precision while maintaining dignified representation.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately intricate or challenging decorative aesthetics when appropriate to Art Nouveau tradition.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures. Emphasis on decorative patterns and literary fantasy elements.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters or modern post-processing; surface must exhibit authentic pen-and-ink characteristics with stained glass lead line integration.

## üìã Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[declared ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Harry Clarke Illuminated Fantasy Illustration Style** for **literary book illustration format**.
- Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression with decorative pattern integration and stained glass precision.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original illuminated fantasy designs avoiding copyrighted elements, focusing on universal themes of literary fantasy and decorative arts tradition.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` with `stained-glass-lead` integration
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `hieratic-formal` or `gestural-fluid`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Clarke's stained glass-influenced book illustration aesthetic with emphasis on decorative pattern integration supersedes photographic realism.
- **Mode Selector:** Literary fantasy book illustration for narrative visualization.

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

**PORTRAIT FORMATS (preferred for literary illustrations):**

- `2:3` (book illustration / literary narrative scenes)
- `3:4` (classical portrait with decorative elements)
- `4:5` (modern book format for detailed fantasy studies)

**LANDSCAPE FORMATS (for panoramic fantasy scenes):**

- `4:3` (classical landscape with decorative borders)
- `16:9` (panoramic fantasy narrative)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** extend-background with intricate decorative patterns or illuminated borders
- **Spatial Allocation:** Central narrative figures with decorative pattern framework supporting composition
- **Background Treatment:** Fill with arabesque patterns, stained glass motifs, or solid black voids extending to full canvas
- **Format Justification:** Ratio serves decorative precision and narrative illustration hierarchy

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Irish Arts and Crafts Movement, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, French Symbolist movement, medieval illuminated manuscripts, stained glass craftsmanship tradition
- **Medium/Production method:** Dip pen and India ink on Bristol board, emphasizing stippling technique and lead line integration from stained glass experience
- **Thematic purpose:** Literary fantasy visualization, decorative narrative illustration, stained glass aesthetic translation to two-dimensional format
- **5 hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**
  - Elongated figures with 120-150% naturalistic proportions and pointed feet characteristic of Art Nouveau stylization
  - Heavy black lead lines functioning as compositional framework with 2-4mm consistent width throughout
  - Intricate stippling patterns achieving 90% detail density in decorative areas with systematic dot spacing
  - Solid black voids comprising 40-60% of composition creating dramatic contrast against detailed stippled areas
  - Arabesque pattern integration with spiral motifs and organic forms filling 70-85% of available decorative space
- **Period framing:** 1910s-1920s Irish Arts and Crafts literary illustration with stained glass workshop precision
- **Tone Tag:** Decoratively intricate, fantastically literary, symbolically rich, craftsman-precise, mysteriously beautiful

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Dip pen technique:** Flexible nib creating variable line weights from 0.5-3mm, India ink flow with authentic bristol board interaction and organic line variation
- **Stippling specifications:** Systematic dot placement with 0.5-2mm spacing variation for tonal gradation, achieving texture through density rather than line work
- **Lead line integration:** Heavy black contour lines mimicking stained glass lead came structure, consistent 2-4mm width creating structural framework
- **Surface preparation:** Bristol board smooth finish allowing precise pen control while maintaining authentic paper tooth interaction
- **Pattern density hierarchy:** Primary narrative elements 100% detail resolution, decorative patterns 90% density, background elements 60-80% depending on compositional needs
- **Solid void management:** Strategic use of pure black areas comprising 40-60% of composition, creating dramatic negative space for pattern relief
- **Detail hierarchy anchor:** Four-and-half day illustration completion timeline reflected in systematic pattern building and precise stippling control
- **Stained glass translation anchor:** Two-dimensional interpretation of three-dimensional glass techniques maintaining lead line structural logic

------
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

- **Wardrobe tracks:** Art Nouveau period fantasy garments, medieval-influenced robes, decorative costume elements with stained glass pattern integration
- **Fabric behavior:** Heavy drapery with decorative pattern integration, period-accurate construction showing Clarke's textile pattern expertise
- **Accessory caps:** Elaborate 3-4 accessories supporting literary narrative context with stained glass decorative elements
- **Color palette:** Monochromatic black and white with selective rich color accents (when appropriate to commission specifications)
- **Wardrobe variation:** Cycle through: decorative robes, fantasy costumes, medieval-influenced garments, Art Nouveau styled clothing with pattern integration
- **Props:** 1 hero + 1 micro prop maximum from literary fantasy vocabulary with stained glass decorative treatment
- **Coherence filter:** All elements support literary fantasy narrative with Arts and Crafts authenticity
