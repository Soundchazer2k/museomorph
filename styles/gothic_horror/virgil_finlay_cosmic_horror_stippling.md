# Virgil Finlay Lovecraftian Cosmic Horror Stippling Illustration Style Prompt

------

## 🔧 Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `stippling-texture` with `scratchboard-carved` integration and `lithographic-precision`
- **Pose Flags:** `hieratic-formal`, `psychological-tension`, `gestural-fluid`
- **Canvas Control Flags:** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`
- **Material Physics Authority:** Scratchboard substrate, India ink, and 290 lithographic pen specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Weird Fiction Integration:** Emphasis on Lovecraftian cosmic horror themes, otherworldly narrative illustration, and atmospheric terror reproduction for rough wood pulp paper while maintaining dignified representation.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately intricate or atmospherically unsettling aesthetics when appropriate to cosmic horror and weird fiction tradition.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures. Emphasis on atmospheric cosmic horror and weird fiction elements.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters or modern post-processing; surface must exhibit authentic scratchboard and stippling characteristics with wood pulp reproduction considerations.

------

## 📋 Framework Sections

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[declared ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Virgil Finlay Lovecraftian Cosmic Horror Stippling Illustration Style** for **weird fiction magazine interior illustration format**.
- Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression with stippling texture integration and scratchboard precision.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original Lovecraftian cosmic horror designs avoiding copyrighted elements, focusing on universal themes of cosmic dread, weird fiction atmosphere, and otherworldly terror.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `stippling-texture` with `scratchboard-carved` integration
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` or `hieratic-formal`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Finlay's stippling-based cosmic horror illustration aesthetic with emphasis on meticulous craftsmanship supersedes photographic realism.
- **Mode Selector:** Weird fiction magazine interior illustration for cosmic horror narrative visualization.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

**PORTRAIT FORMATS (preferred for cosmic horror illustrations):**

- `2:3` (weird fiction magazine interior / cosmic horror narrative scenes)
- `3:4` (classical portrait with otherworldly elements)
- `4:5` (modern magazine format for detailed character studies in cosmic dread)

**LANDSCAPE FORMATS (for panoramic cosmic horror scenes):**

- `4:3` (classical landscape with otherworldly environments)
- `16:9` (panoramic cosmic horror vistas)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** extend-background with stippled atmospheric effects or otherworldly environments
- **Spatial Allocation:** Central narrative figures with supporting cosmic horror/weird fiction elements in stippling framework
- **Background Treatment:** Fill with psychologically disturbing stippling patterns, eldritch otherworldly environments, or oppressive solid black voids extending to full canvas with wood pulp reproduction considerations for cosmic horror atmosphere that suggests humanity's cosmic insignificance
- **Format Justification:** Ratio serves dramatic weird fiction illustration and cosmic horror layout hierarchy

------

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** American weird fiction tradition, H.P. Lovecraft cosmic horror aesthetic, Gothic Revival architecture, Gustave Doré engraving techniques, Pablo Picasso modernist influence, Edgar Allan Poe atmospheric terror
- **Medium/Production method:** 290 lithographic pen with India ink on scratchboard, emphasizing stippling technique with scratchboard subtractive methods for cosmic horror visualization
- **Thematic purpose:** Lovecraftian cosmic horror narrative visualization, weird fiction atmosphere illustration, otherworldly terror atmosphere with psychological dread storytelling
- **5 hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**
  - Meticulous stippling patterns achieving 95% detail density through individual dot placement creating obsessive texture suggesting cosmic terror
  - Scratchboard subtractive techniques creating 40-60% white line work carved from black ink surface evoking otherworldly luminosity
  - Gothic horror proportions with 110-130% naturalistic scaling for dramatic weird fiction impact and psychological unease
  - Cosmic/otherworldly environments with 80-90% stippled atmospheric detail density suggesting vast unknowable forces
  - Individual dot application using lithographic pen requiring 8 hours to several days completion timeline reflecting obsessive attention to cosmic dread details
- **Period framing:** 1930s-1950s American weird fiction magazine illustration with wood pulp paper reproduction considerations for Weird Tales and similar publications
- **Tone Tag:** Cosmically atmospheric, meticulously crafted, psychologically unsettling, otherworldly dramatic, weird-fiction-authentically detailed

------

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Lithographic pen technique:** 290 lithographic pen (ultra-fine point) with India ink, individual dot application requiring pen-tip wiping after each stipple for authentic pointillist texture
- **Scratchboard specifications:** Clay-covered board coated with black ink, white line carving using sharp blade creating 40-60% subtractive white areas
- **Stippling density control:** Individual dots spaced 0.5-2mm apart for tonal gradation, hundreds to thousands of dots per square inch in detailed areas
- **Surface preparation:** Scratchboard substrate allowing both additive pen work and subtractive blade work with authentic clay surface interaction
- **Detail hierarchy anchor:** Primary narrative elements 100% stippling resolution, secondary elements 80% density, atmospheric elements 60% with systematic dot spacing reduction
- **Reproduction compatibility anchor:** Technique optimized for wood pulp paper reproduction maintaining detail clarity at Weird Tales magazine scale
- **Time investment anchor:** Eight hours to several days per illustration timeline reflected in meticulous stippling density and scratchboard precision
- **Tool specificity anchor:** 290 lithographic pen point so fine that most artists cannot use it, requiring months of searching for properly flowing pens

------

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

- **Wardrobe tracks:** 1930s-1950s period occult investigator clothing, scholarly academic attire, weird fiction character garments with cosmic horror aesthetic and period authenticity
- **Fabric behavior:** Period-accurate construction showing Finlay's attention to textile rendering through stippling technique with emphasis on scholarly and occult themes, fabric showing signs of tension or distress (wrinkled from clutching forbidden knowledge, disheveled from cosmic revelations)
- **Accessory caps:** Elaborate 3-4 accessories supporting cosmic horror/weird fiction narrative context with occult or scholarly elements
- **Color palette:** Monochromatic black and white with full tonal range achieved through stippling density variation
- **Wardrobe variation:** Cycle through: occult investigator clothing, weird fiction academic attire, mysterious scholarly robes, period horror clothing with stippled detail integration
- **Props:** 1 hero + 1 micro prop maximum from cosmic horror/weird fiction vocabulary with scratchboard treatment
- **Coherence filter:** All elements support Lovecraftian cosmic horror narrative with period authenticity
