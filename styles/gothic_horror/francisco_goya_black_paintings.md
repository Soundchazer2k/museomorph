about: >
  Francisco Goya’s late murals smear oil into plaster like nightmares—impasto
  ridges, cavernous blacks, and faces bloated with dread. Painted in isolation
  after illness and revolution, they read as private exorcisms. We stay in that
  claustrophobic register while summoning fresh phantoms, props, and political
  shadows.

# Francisco Goya Black Paintings Style Prompt
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **4:3 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely. Redraw in **Goya's Black Paintings style circa 1820-1823** for **oil painting on plaster transferred to canvas**. Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression with psychological intensity. **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original designs avoiding copyrighted elements, focusing on universal human psychological themes. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean` with `impasto-sculptural` and `alla-prima-direct` **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style Dominance:** Goya's late period psychological expressionism supersedes all decorative or harmonious elements **Mode Selector:** Gallery painting for private contemplation
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `4:3` (classical landscape format matching Goya's wall proportions)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** extend-background with atmospheric depth
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject placement in psychological tension zones, off-center for compositional modernity
- **Background Treatment:** Fill with "avernal darkness" extending seamlessly from center
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 portrait ratio serves Goya's intimate psychological studies and allows for figure dominance with atmospheric depth
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Goya's Black Paintings (1820-1823), Romantic pessimism, post-illness psychological transformation, Spanish political turmoil **Medium/Production method:** Oil paint applied al secco directly onto plaster walls using broad strokes, large brushes, palette knives, and possibly sponges. Thick impasto with 3-5mm paint thickness, no preparatory drawings. **Thematic purpose:** Private psychological expression of deepest fears, political disillusionment, and human darkness **Hallmark motifs:**

- Chiaroscuro lighting with 90% darkness, 10% dramatic illumination
- Figures emerging from "avernal darkness"
- Off-center compositional imbalance (150% modern asymmetry)
- Thick, agitated brushwork showing tool marks and palette knife scraping
- Psychological facial distortion with bulging eyes and gaping mouths **Period framing:** Spain 1820-1823, liberal constitutional period, political repression, Goya's deafness and isolation **Tone Tag:** Pessimistic, nightmarish, psychologically violent **Production Era Authenticity:** Oil on plaster al secco technique with characteristic cracking and transfer damage from 1874 canvas mounting
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Paint application:** Thick impasto 3-5mm deep with visible palette knife marks, broad brush strokes applied rapidly and aggressively, fat-over-lean oil technique with linseed oil binding **Color mixing:** Earth palette - yellow ochre, brown ochre, light red, burnt sienna, four varieties of black (bone, ivory, lamp, peach), lead white, minimal vermillion accents **Texture specifications:** Rough, craggy surface texture simulating plaster substrate, aggressive tool marks from palette knives and large bristle brushes **Edge treatment:** Lost edges dissolving into darkness, hard edges only for psychological emphasis **Stroke economy:** Economical but expressive - maximum psychological impact with minimum strokes, directional brushwork following form and emotion **Surface depth:** Heavy impasto creating sculptural relief, paint thickness variations creating tactile surface **Detail hierarchy:** Sparse detail work, concentrated in psychologically critical areas (eyes, mouths, hands) **Material authenticity:** Authentic oil paint behavior with linseed oil flow characteristics, no modern acrylic smoothness **Scale proportions:** Anatomical distortions for psychological effect - neck elongation 120%, head size variations, bulging eyes 150% normal scale **Tool marks:** Visible palette knife scraping, bristle brush texture, sponge dabbing marks in atmospheric areas
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks:**

- Adult neutral: rough peasant clothing, monk's robes, Spanish period dress (1820s)
- Fabric behavior: Heavy woolens with matte finish, coarse linen with authentic drape **Accessory caps:** Minimalist 0-1 accessories **Color palette:** Restricted to earth tones - ochres, umbers, sienna, blacks, single white accent **Wardrobe variation:** Cycle through: dark monk robes, peasant browns, noble blacks, white ceremonial dress **Props:** 1 hero prop maximum: cudgel, book, ceremonial object, human skull **Coherence filter:** All elements support psychological narrative, authentic to 1820s Spain

**YAML Props Pool:**

```yaml
religious: [crucifix, prayer_book, monk_cowl, rosary_beads]
violence: [cudgel, rope, knife, gallows]
political: [constitution_papers, royal_decree, chains, crown]
mortality: [human_skull, hourglass, wilted_flowers, coffin]
```
## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "harmonious composition"
- "beautiful", "pleasant", "decorative", "ornamental"
- "bright lighting", "cheerful", "optimistic", "colorful"
- "smooth finish", "refined technique", "academic precision"

**✅ Canvas Positives:**

- "exactly 4:3 ratio", "recomposed for landscape format"
- "thick impasto 3-5mm paint thickness", "palette knife texture marks"
- "deep atmospheric shadow with 90% coverage", "psychological intensity zones"
- "earth pigment palette authentic to 1820s", "oil on plaster al secco technique"
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**4:3 LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

- Horizontal emphasis with psychological depth
- Environmental context 60%, figure dominance 40%
- Atmospheric staging with Goya's theatrical lighting

**GOYA-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- Perspective: Psychological space over geometric accuracy
- Grid/symmetry: Deliberately unbalanced, figures off-center for modern compositional approach
- Figure:ground 40:60 with figures emerging from darkness
- Density 20% - sparse, concentrated psychological impact
- Lighting: Dramatic chiaroscuro - single light source illuminating key psychological elements
- Detail:negative space 10:90 - vast areas of darkness with concentrated detail zones

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context:** Oil on plaster wall texture with transfer to canvas artifacts
- **Frame/Band:** Omit entirely - no decorative framing
- **Production Context:** Al secco technique on plaster substrate with 1874 transfer damage characteristics
- **Ratio Enforcement:** Composition designed for 4:3 theatrical viewing, horizontal psychological narrative
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Omit text entirely - Goya's Black Paintings contained no text elements **Historical accuracy:** No typography - these were private wall paintings, not public works **Production Method:** Pure visual expression without textual explanation
