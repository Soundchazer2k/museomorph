  H. R. Giger welded flesh and machinery into erotic nightmares‚Äîairbrushed
  spinal columns, uterus pods, and cathedral-scale turbines. The result is both
  sacred and surgical. We honor that biomechanical liturgy while designing new
  organisms, altars, and dystopian habitats.

# H.R. Giger Biomechanical Surrealist Style Prompt

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1‚Üí8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials are applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `airbrush-gradient` with `biomechanical-fusion` and `technological-integration`
- **Pose Flags:** `hieratic-formal`, `psychological-tension`, `technological-symbiosis`
- **Canvas Control Flags:** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`
- **Material Physics Authority:** Canvas board substrate, acrylic paint, and professional airbrush specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Biomechanical Authorization:** Emphasis on technological-organic fusion, architectural precision, and surrealist transformation while maintaining dignified representation.
- **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately unsettling technological aesthetics when appropriate to surrealist tradition.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures. Emphasis on technological fusion and architectural elements.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters or modern post-processing; surface must exhibit authentic airbrush characteristics.

## üìã Framework Sections
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[declared ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **H.R. Giger Biomechanical Surrealist Style** for **museum gallery illustration format**.
- Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression with technological integration and architectural precision.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original biomechanical designs avoiding copyrighted elements, focusing on universal themes of technological evolution and organic-mechanical fusion.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `airbrush-gradient` with `biomechanical-fusion`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `hieratic-formal` or `technological-symbiosis`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Giger's biomechanical surrealism with emphasis on technological-organic fusion supersedes photographic realism.
- **Mode Selector:** Museum surrealist art for technological transformation visualization.

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

**PORTRAIT FORMATS (preferred for biomechanical entities):**

- `2:3` (surrealist painting / vertical architectural emphasis)
- `3:4` (classical portrait with technological elements)
- `4:5` (modern gallery format for detailed biomechanical studies)

**LANDSCAPE FORMATS (for environmental biomechanical landscapes):**

- `4:3` (classical landscape with technological architecture)
- `16:9` (panoramic biomechanical environments)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** extend-background with technological architecture or mechanical environments
- **Spatial Allocation:** Central biomechanical entity placement with supporting technological framework
- **Background Treatment:** Fill with intricate mechanical architectures, technological corridors, or biomechanical landscapes extending to full canvas
- **Format Justification:** Ratio serves architectural precision and technological detail hierarchy

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

- **Influences:** Swiss Surrealism, Bauhaus precision, Ernst Fuchs, Salvador Dal√≠, architectural draftsmanship, technical illustration tradition
- **Medium/Production method:** Professional airbrush technique on canvas board using acrylic paints, emphasizing smooth gradations and precise mechanical detail
- **Thematic purpose:** Exploration of technological-organic fusion, architectural biomechanics, future evolution of form, and surrealist transformation
- **5 hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**
  - Biomechanical fusion elements with 90% geometric precision and 10% organic flow integration
  - Monochromatic palette with 95% grayscale range and selective metallic accent applications
  - Architectural corridor perspectives with 3-point perspective accuracy and 2-4mm technical line precision
  - Smooth airbrush gradations with 0.5mm edge transitions and seamless tonal modulation
  - Technological detail density at 85% coverage with systematic hierarchical organization
- **Period framing:** 1970s-1980s surrealist technical illustration with Swiss precision aesthetics
- **Tone Tag:** Technological, architectural, precisely surreal, biomechanically evolved, coldly beautiful

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

- **Airbrush technique:** Professional dual-action airbrush with 0.2-0.35mm needle creating seamless gradations, acrylic paint thinned to milk consistency with authentic paint flow characteristics and subtle application irregularities
- **Surface preparation:** Canvas board with smooth tooth for precise airbrush application, minimal texture interference but retaining authentic canvas grain
- **Tonal system:** Full monochromatic range with emphasis on mid-tones (40-60% gray values), strategic pure whites and deep blacks for contrast, avoiding digital perfection
- **Edge control:** Hand-controlled airbrush edges with subtle organic variation, stencil work for geometric precision but with authentic paint bleed characteristics
- **Material authenticity anchor:** Hand-painted surface qualities with subtle airbrush spatter, organic paint application variations, authentic canvas interaction avoiding CGI smoothness
- **Analog imperfection anchor:** Include subtle hand-painting irregularities, authentic airbrush overspray effects, organic paint flow variations that distinguish from digital rendering
- **Detail hierarchy:** Primary biomechanical elements 100% resolution, secondary technological components 75%, atmospheric elements 40%
- **Material simulation:** Metallic surfaces with authentic reflectivity gradients, organic elements with subtle texture variation
- **Atmospheric technique:** Subtle depth through tonal modulation rather than atmospheric perspective, emphasis on architectural lighting
- **Scale proportions:** Precise architectural measurements with biomechanical elements following technical drawing conventions

------
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

- **Wardrobe tracks:** Technological integration garments, architectural clothing forms, biomechanical accessories with precise geometric construction
- **Fabric behavior:** Synthetic materials with technological appearance, smooth surfaces reflecting airbrush technique aesthetic
- **Accessory caps:** Minimalist 0-2 accessories focusing on technological integration elements
- **Color palette:** Monochromatic grayscale with selective metallic accents - no color unless specifically technological (chrome, steel, titanium)
- **Wardrobe variation:** Cycle through: technological integration suits, architectural garments, biomechanical accessories, precision-engineered details
- **Props:** 1 hero + 1 micro prop maximum from biomechanical technological vocabulary
- **Coherence filter:** All elements support technological-organic fusion with architectural precision

**YAML Props Pool:**

- **Historical accuracy:** Pure airbrush art format appropriate to Swiss surrealist tradition
- **Biomechanical Emphasis:** Visual narrative through technological detail and architectural precision rather than textual elements
