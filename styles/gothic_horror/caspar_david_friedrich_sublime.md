# Caspar David Friedrich Romantic Sublime Style Prompt
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **4:3 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely. Redraw in **Friedrich's German Romantic landscape style circa 1810-1830** for **oil painting on fine primed canvas**. Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression with spiritual contemplation. **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original designs avoiding copyrighted elements, focusing on universal sublime landscape themes. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean` with `glazing-layers-buildup` **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` (Rückenfigur contemplation) **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style Dominance:** Friedrich's sublime spiritual landscapes supersede all decorative or conventional beauty elements **Mode Selector:** Gallery painting for transcendental contemplation
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `4:3` (classical landscape format matching Friedrich's compositional preferences)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** extend-background with atmospheric depth and infinite perspective
- **Spatial Allocation:** Rückenfigur placement in lower third, vast sky dominating upper two-thirds
- **Background Treatment:** Fill with graduated atmospheric effects extending to infinite horizon
- **Format Justification:** 4:3 ratio serves Friedrich's horizontal sublime landscapes and allows for proper sky-to-earth proportions essential to the spiritual experience
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** German Romanticism, Kantian sublime, Lutheran spirituality, Gothic revival, Northern European landscape tradition **Medium/Production method:** Oil paint applied in thin transparent washes over detailed underdrawing on fine primed canvas. Multiple glazing layers with precise stippling and controlled brushwork. **Thematic purpose:** Spiritual contemplation through nature's sublime power, existential meditation on humanity's place in the infinite **Hallmark motifs:**

- Rückenfigur (figures seen from behind) as viewer surrogates in contemplative poses
- Atmospheric perspective with graduated tonal values dissolving into infinity
- Gothic ruins and church spires as spiritual anchors in natural vastness
- Dramatic sky-to-earth ratios (70% sky, 30% earth)
- Sfumato effects in distant mountains and fog-filled valleys **Period framing:** German Romantic period 1810-1830, post-Napoleonic spiritual awakening, Lutheran mysticism **Tone Tag:** Sublime, contemplative, spiritually transcendent **Production Era Authenticity:** Early 19th century oil glazing techniques with period-appropriate pigment limitations and canvas preparation
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Paint application:** Thin transparent washes built up in multiple glazing layers, oil-fat-over-lean technique with linseed oil medium **Color mixing:** Early period - iron-based yellows, smalt blues, lead white, earth pigments; Later period - chromium yellows, cobalt blue, cadmium accents **Texture specifications:** Smooth, precise surface achieved through controlled stippling and delicate brushwork, minimal visible impasto **Edge treatment:** Soft sfumato transitions in atmospheric areas, precise linear definition in foreground elements **Stroke economy:** Economical precise strokes following detailed underdrawing, stippling technique for translucent mist effects **Surface depth:** Multiple transparent glazes creating luminous atmospheric depth, careful tonal gradations **Detail hierarchy:** Precise detail in foreground diminishing to atmospheric suggestion in distance **Material authenticity:** Period-accurate glazing with natural pigments, avoiding modern synthetic consistency **Scale proportions:** Figures reduced to 5-10% of canvas height to emphasize sublime scale relationships **Underdrawing authority:** Detailed preliminary drawing in pencil/ink establishing architectural and landscape structure **Atmospheric technique:** Smalt stippling for translucent mist effects, graduated tonal washes for infinite depth
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks:**

- Adult neutral: German Romantic period dress (1810-1830) - long coats, cloaks, simple traveling attire
- Fabric behavior: Heavy wool and linen with period-accurate silhouettes, natural drape without synthetic sheen **Accessory caps:** Minimalist 0-1 accessories **Color palette:** Restricted to earth tones, dark blues, browns, blacks, single white accent for spiritual emphasis **Wardrobe variation:** Cycle through: dark traveling coat, monk's robe, simple dress, peasant clothing **Props:** 1 hero prop maximum: walking stick, prayer book, simple cross, landscape sketching materials **Coherence filter:** All elements support spiritual contemplation narrative, authentic to 1810-1830 German culture

**YAML Props Pool:**

```yaml
spiritual: [simple_cross, prayer_book, rosary, pilgrimage_staff]
scholarly: [sketching_pad, natural_history_book, compass, walking_stick]
memorial: [gravestone, church_ruins, ancient_oak, abandoned_shrine]
natural: [weathered_rock, fallen_tree, mountain_cairn, seashells]
```

- Detail:negative space 10:90 - minimal detail serving maximum atmospheric effect

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context:** Fine primed canvas with smooth luminous surface for glazing techniques
- **Frame/Band:** Omit entirely - no decorative framing elements
- **Production Context:** Oil glazing on fine canvas appropriate to German Romantic period techniques
- **Ratio Enforcement:** Composition designed for 4:3 sublime landscape viewing with proper sky-earth proportions
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Omit text entirely - Friedrich's landscapes were pure visual spiritual experiences **Historical accuracy:** No typography - these were contemplative paintings without textual elements **Production Method:** Pure atmospheric visual communication without linguistic interference

------

- ### 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

  

  - **Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression with \*psychological dread and spectral presence\*.** (Instead of literary grandeur, focus on fear and the otherworldly).
  - **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Keep as is, focusing on universal human psychological themes and avoiding copyrighted elements.
  - **Face-Treatment Flag:** `engrave-hatch with skeletal-gauntness and haunted-eyes`
  - **Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid (contorted-agony or spectral-glide)`
  - **Style Dominance:** Doré's theatrical literary illustration **with an emphasis on the grotesque and the supernatural** supersedes photographic realism.
  - **Mode Selector:** Book illustration for **macabre narrative visualization or dark poetry.**
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

  

  - **Spatial Allocation:** *Tormented figure placement with diminishing hope, supporting grotesque elements in a suffocating arrangement.*
  - **Background Treatment:** Fill with *suffocating cross-hatched environments, decaying architecture, or spectral mists extending to full canvas.*
  - **Format Justification:** Keep as is.
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

  

  - **Influences:** *German Expressionism, Romantic horror literature (Poe, Shelley), Medieval danse macabre, Baroque dramatic composition with a focus on decay.*
  - **Thematic purpose:** *Dramatic visualization of existential horror, spectral encounters, moral decay, and the fragility of sanity with theatrical grandeur.*
  - **Hallmark motifs:**
    - Monumental figure scale (keep as is, but figures could be more emaciated or distorted).
    - Intricate cross-hatching patterns creating rich tonal gradation from pure white to deep black.
    - *Decaying architectural grandeur with crumbling Gothic and skeletal elements.*
    - *Atmospheric perspective achieved through line density variation, emphasizing oppressive fog or shadowy miasma.*
    - *Theatrical chiaroscuro with a single, sickly light source or spectral glow, emphasizing deep, consuming shadows.*
  - **Tone Tag:** *Ominous, horrifying, psychologically unsettling, grotesquely dramatic, melancholic.*
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

  

  - **Tonal system:** Complete grayscale range with an emphasis on *deep, suffocating blacks and stark, ghostly whites.*
  - **Cross-hatching specifications:** Keep as is, but emphasize *dense, agitated hatching for areas of dread and decay.*
  - **Surface simulation:** Authentic wood engraving line quality with characteristic white-on-black relief printing effects, *hinting at aged, brittle paper or crumbling stone.*
  - **Scale proportions:** Heroic figure proportions with 120-150% naturalistic scale, *with possible anatomical distortions leaning towards the gaunt or unnaturally elongated for spectral beings.*
  - **Atmospheric technique:** Line density variation for depth, *emphasizing suffocating fog, swirling spectral forms, or dust motes in stagnant air.*
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

  

  - **Wardrobe tracks:**

    - *Tattered robes, decaying aristocratic attire, burial shrouds, skeletal remains, spectral wisps with period-accurate draping.*
    - *Fabric behavior: Heavy drapery with dramatic folds, appearing torn, decaying, or ethereal.*

  - **Accessory caps:** Elaborate 3-4 accessories supporting *macabre narrative context, symbols of death or despair.*

  - **Wardrobe variation:** Cycle through: *tattered black cloaks, ghostly white shrouds, ceremonial garments stained with decay, skeletal armor.*

  - **Props:** 1 hero + 1 micro prop maximum: *scythe, hourglass, human skull (perhaps decaying), broken cross, rusted chains, spectral lantern, wilted flowers.*

  - **Coherence filter:** All elements support *gothic horror/supernatural narrative with implied historical or folkloric authenticity.*

  - **YAML Props Pool:**

    

    `gothic_horror: [scythe, human_skull, rusted_chains, broken_cross, spectral_lantern, withered_flowers, open_coffin, crow_perched]`

    `decaying_architecture: [crumbling_archway, moss-covered_statue, shattered_stained_glass, leaning_tombstone]`

    `macabre_symbols: [hourglass_nearly_empty, raven, shrouded_figure, single_candle_flickering]`
## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

  

  - **❌ Canvas Negatives:** Add "cheerfulness", "harmony", "beauty", "optimistic", "cleanliness".
  - **✅ Canvas Positives:** Add "decaying architectural grandeur", "suffocating atmospheric effects", "spectral figures", "psychological terror".
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

  

  - **DORÉ-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**
    - **Perspective:** Theatrical staging with *claustrophobic viewpoints, looming, decaying architecture, and an unsettling sense of scale.*
    - **Lighting:** Single dramatic light source creating strong chiaroscuro with pure white highlights, *but emphasizing deep, oppressive shadows where malevolent forces might lurk, or a sickly, greenish glow.*
    - **Detail:negative space 80:20 - dense engraving detail with strategic white space for spectral effects or moments of stark terror.*
  - **REQUIRED ANCHORS:**
    - **Surface Context:** Boxwood engraving block surface translated to white paper with authentic relief printing characteristics, *but with hints of aging, staining, or the brittle texture of ancient manuscripts.*

  By implementing these changes, the prompt emphasizes the chilling and macabre aspects of gothic horror through atmosphere, thematic elements, and subtle stylistic shifts, all while remaining within the technical and artistic framework of Gustave Doré's wood engraving style.
