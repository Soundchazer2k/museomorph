  Friedrich places lone figures before eternity—pale dawns, gravestone silhouettes,

# Caspar David Friedrich Romantic Sublime Style Prompt

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **4:3 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely. Redraw in **Friedrich's German Romantic landscape style circa 1810-1830** for **oil painting on fine primed canvas**. Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression with spiritual contemplation. **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original designs avoiding copyrighted elements, focusing on universal sublime landscape themes. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean` with `glazing-layers-buildup` **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` (Rückenfigur contemplation) **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style Dominance:** Friedrich's sublime spiritual landscapes supersede all decorative or conventional beauty elements **Mode Selector:** Gallery painting for transcendental contemplation

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `4:3` (classical landscape format matching Friedrich's compositional preferences)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** extend-background with atmospheric depth and infinite perspective
- **Spatial Allocation:** Rückenfigur placement in lower third, vast sky dominating upper two-thirds
- **Background Treatment:** Fill with graduated atmospheric effects extending to infinite horizon
- **Format Justification:** 4:3 ratio serves Friedrich's horizontal sublime landscapes and allows for proper sky-to-earth proportions essential to the spiritual experience

## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** German Romanticism, Kantian sublime, Lutheran spirituality, Gothic revival, Northern European landscape tradition **Medium/Production method:** Oil paint applied in thin transparent washes over detailed underdrawing on fine primed canvas. Multiple glazing layers with precise stippling and controlled brushwork. **Thematic purpose:** Spiritual contemplation through nature's sublime power, existential meditation on humanity's place in the infinite **Hallmark motifs:**

- Rückenfigur (figures seen from behind) as viewer surrogates in contemplative poses
- Atmospheric perspective with graduated tonal values dissolving into infinity
- Gothic ruins and church spires as spiritual anchors in natural vastness
- Dramatic sky-to-earth ratios (70% sky, 30% earth)
- Sfumato effects in distant mountains and fog-filled valleys **Period framing:** German Romantic period 1810-1830, post-Napoleonic spiritual awakening, Lutheran mysticism **Tone Tag:** Sublime, contemplative, spiritually transcendent **Production Era Authenticity:** Early 19th century oil glazing techniques with period-appropriate pigment limitations and canvas preparation

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Paint application:** Thin transparent washes built up in multiple glazing layers, oil-fat-over-lean technique with linseed oil medium **Color mixing:** Early period - iron-based yellows, smalt blues, lead white, earth pigments; Later period - chromium yellows, cobalt blue, cadmium accents **Texture specifications:** Smooth, precise surface achieved through controlled stippling and delicate brushwork, minimal visible impasto **Edge treatment:** Soft sfumato transitions in atmospheric areas, precise linear definition in foreground elements **Stroke economy:** Economical precise strokes following detailed underdrawing, stippling technique for translucent mist effects **Surface depth:** Multiple transparent glazes creating luminous atmospheric depth, careful tonal gradations **Detail hierarchy:** Precise detail in foreground diminishing to atmospheric suggestion in distance **Material authenticity:** Period-accurate glazing with natural pigments, avoiding modern synthetic consistency **Scale proportions:** Figures reduced to 5-10% of canvas height to emphasize sublime scale relationships **Underdrawing authority:** Detailed preliminary drawing in pencil/ink establishing architectural and landscape structure **Atmospheric technique:** Smalt stippling for translucent mist effects, graduated tonal washes for infinite depth

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe tracks:**

- Adult neutral: German Romantic period dress (1810-1830) - long coats, cloaks, simple traveling attire
- Fabric behavior: Heavy wool and linen with period-accurate silhouettes, natural drape without synthetic sheen **Accessory caps:** Minimalist 0-1 accessories **Color palette:** Restricted to earth tones, dark blues, browns, blacks, single white accent for spiritual emphasis **Wardrobe variation:** Cycle through: dark traveling coat, monk's robe, simple dress, peasant clothing **Props:** 1 hero prop maximum: walking stick, prayer book, simple cross, landscape sketching materials **Coherence filter:** All elements support spiritual contemplation narrative, authentic to 1810-1830 German culture

**YAML Props Pool:**

```yaml
spiritual: [simple_cross, prayer_book, rosary, pilgrimage_staff]
scholarly: [sketching_pad, natural_history_book, compass, walking_stick]
memorial: [gravestone, church_ruins, ancient_oak, abandoned_shrine]
natural: [weathered_rock, fallen_tree, mountain_cairn, seashells]
```

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**❌ Canvas Negatives:**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "bright cheerful colors"
- "busy composition", "multiple focal points", "decorative ornament"
- "modern clothing", "contemporary elements", "visible faces in detail"
- "dramatic lighting contrasts", "theatrical illumination", "artificial highlighting"

**✅ Canvas Positives:**

- "exactly 4:3 ratio", "recomposed for landscape sublime format"
- "atmospheric graduated tones", "sfumato mist effects with stippled technique"
- "Rückenfigur contemplative positioning", "spiritual transcendence through nature"
- "period-accurate glazing layers", "detailed underdrawing precision", "infinite atmospheric perspective"

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**4:3 LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

- Horizontal emphasis with infinite atmospheric depth
- Sky dominance ≥70%, earthly context ≤30%
- Sublime staging with transcendental viewing experience

**FRIEDRICH-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- Perspective: Atmospheric perspective with graduated tonal dissolution toward infinite horizon
- Grid/symmetry: Subtle symmetrical balance with off-center Rückenfigur placement
- Figure:ground 5:95 - tiny human figures emphasizing sublime scale
- Density 15% - vast empty spaces essential for transcendental effect
- Lighting: Soft, diffused natural light with subtle directional emphasis from horizon
- Detail:negative space 10:90 - minimal detail serving maximum atmospheric effect

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context:** Fine primed canvas with smooth luminous surface for glazing techniques
- **Frame/Band:** Omit entirely - no decorative framing elements
- **Production Context:** Oil glazing on fine canvas appropriate to German Romantic period techniques
- **Ratio Enforcement:** Composition designed for 4:3 sublime landscape viewing with proper sky-earth proportions

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** Omit text entirely - Friedrich's landscapes were pure visual spiritual experiences **Historical accuracy:** No typography - these were contemplative paintings without textual elements **Production Method:** Pure atmospheric visual communication without linguistic interference
