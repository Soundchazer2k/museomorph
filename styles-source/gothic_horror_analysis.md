# Francisco Goya Black Paintings Style Prompt

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **4:3 ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely. Redraw in **Goya's Black Paintings style circa 1820-1823** for **oil painting on plaster transferred to canvas**. Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression with psychological intensity. **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original designs avoiding copyrighted elements, focusing on universal human psychological themes. **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean` with `impasto-sculptural` and `alla-prima-direct` **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` **Style Dominance:** Goya's late period psychological expressionism supersedes all decorative or harmonious elements **Mode Selector:** Gallery painting for private contemplation

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `4:3` (classical landscape format matching Goya's wall proportions)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** extend-background with atmospheric depth
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject placement in psychological tension zones, off-center for compositional modernity
- **Background Treatment:** Fill with "avernal darkness" extending seamlessly from center
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 portrait ratio serves Goya's intimate psychological studies and allows for figure dominance with atmospheric depth

## 3) Artistic Style & Context

**Influences:** Goya's Black Paintings (1820-1823), Romantic pessimism, post-illness psychological transformation, Spanish political turmoil **Medium/Production method:** Oil paint applied al secco directly onto plaster walls using broad strokes, large brushes, palette knives, and possibly sponges. Thick impasto with 3-5mm paint thickness, no preparatory drawings. **Thematic purpose:** Private psychological expression of deepest fears, political disillusionment, and human darkness **Hallmark motifs:**

- Chiaroscuro lighting with 90% darkness, 10% dramatic illumination
- Figures emerging from "avernal darkness"
- Off-center compositional imbalance (150% modern asymmetry)
- Thick, agitated brushwork showing tool marks and palette knife scraping
- Psychological facial distortion with bulging eyes and gaping mouths **Period framing:** Spain 1820-1823, liberal constitutional period, political repression, Goya's deafness and isolation **Tone Tag:** Pessimistic, nightmarish, psychologically violent **Production Era Authenticity:** Oil on plaster al secco technique with characteristic cracking and transfer damage from 1874 canvas mounting

## 4) Technical Execution

**Paint application:** Thick impasto 3-5mm deep with visible palette knife marks, broad brush strokes applied rapidly and aggressively, fat-over-lean oil technique with linseed oil binding **Color mixing:** Earth palette - yellow ochre, brown ochre, light red, burnt sienna, four varieties of black (bone, ivory, lamp, peach), lead white, minimal vermillion accents **Texture specifications:** Rough, craggy surface texture simulating plaster substrate, aggressive tool marks from palette knives and large bristle brushes **Edge treatment:** Lost edges dissolving into darkness, hard edges only for psychological emphasis **Stroke economy:** Economical but expressive - maximum psychological impact with minimum strokes, directional brushwork following form and emotion **Surface depth:** Heavy impasto creating sculptural relief, paint thickness variations creating tactile surface **Detail hierarchy:** Sparse detail work, concentrated in psychologically critical areas (eyes, mouths, hands) **Material authenticity:** Authentic oil paint behavior with linseed oil flow characteristics, no modern acrylic smoothness **Scale proportions:** Anatomical distortions for psychological effect - neck elongation 120%, head size variations, bulging eyes 150% normal scale **Tool marks:** Visible palette knife scraping, bristle brush texture, sponge dabbing marks in atmospheric areas

  # Gustave Doré Gothic Horror Framework
  
  ## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter
  
  **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
  
  **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
  
  **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette, gesture, and expression unless photographic.
  
  **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("20-80 lines per square inch cross-hatching," "figures occupy <30% of image area") override descriptive language.
  
  **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How engraving tools create marks supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
  
  **Material Physics Authority:** Wood-engraving tool limitations, end-grain hardwood characteristics, and ink-on-paper binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences.
  
  **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` — Fine parallel and cross-hatched lines build all facial tones; no photographic gradation.
  
  **Pose Flags:** `gestural-fluid`, `psychological-tension`, `contorted-psychological` — Theatrical poses captured at moment of maximum narrative drama.
  
  **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` — Recompose entirely for declared vertical portrait ratio.
  
  **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.
  
  **Text policy:** Omit all text unless Section 8 authorizes.
  
  **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore beyond period-appropriate biblical/literary horror context; no real logos/watermarks/signatures.
  
  **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest period-appropriate clothing; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.
  
  **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
  
  **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics traditional media; surface must exhibit authentic wood-engraving characteristics — visible directional linework creating all tones.
  
  **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
  
  **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid photographic realism, digital smoothing, halftone dots, flat even lighting, static minimalist compositions.
  
  **Silent validation:** Apply framework requirements, regenerate silently if fail.
  
  ------
  
  ## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate
  
  **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to **2:3 ratio** (primary) or **3:4 ratio** (alternative) — ignore source image dimensions completely.
  
  Redraw in **19th-Century French Romantic Illustration / Wood-Engraving style** for **mass-publication book illustration plate**.
  
  Identity via silhouette, gesture, and dramatic expression — not photographic likeness.

  **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original gothic horror scene inspired by literary traditions (Dante, Milton, Biblical narratives) avoiding copyrighted character elements. No recognizable modern horror franchise iconography.

  **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` — All facial features constructed through visible parallel and cross-hatched engraving lines.

  **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension` or `contorted-psychological` — Capture figure at moment of supernatural awe, terror, or spiritual revelation.

  **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` — Entirely new composition optimized for vertical 2:3 or 3:4 format.

  **Style Dominance:** Gustave Doré's dramatic chiaroscuro, theatrical gestures, and overwhelmed-human-in-sublime-environment aesthetic overrides all other stylistic considerations.

  **Mode Selector:** Gallery print / Book illustration plate

  ------

  ## 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

  **MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

  - Primary: `2:3` (standard vertical portrait for biblical/literary horror scenes)
  - Alternative: `3:4` (classical portrait orientation for book illustration)
  
  **Note on Ratio Flexibility:** Source image aspect ratios may influence final output. While target ratios are specified above, variations within the vertical portrait family (2:3 to 3:4 range) maintain authentic Doré proportions.
  
  **CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**
  
  - **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely — design new vertical composition from ground up
  - **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned in lower-to-middle third, allowing vast supernatural/architectural environment to dominate upper 60-70% of frame
  - **Background Treatment:** Extend dramatic atmospheric environment (vast caverns, turbulent skies, decaying architecture, sublime landscapes) to fill entire vertical canvas with environmental hostility
  - **Format Justification:** 2:3 or 3:4 vertical ratio serves Doré's signature compositional strategy of dwarfing human figures within overwhelming sublime environments, maximizing vertical space for towering architecture, cosmic visions, or oppressive darkness
  
  ------
  
  ## 3) Artistic Style & Context
  
  **Influences:**
  
  - Literary sources: Dante Alighieri's *Divine Comedy*, John Milton's *Paradise Lost*, Biblical narratives, Lord Byron, Edgar Allan Poe
  - Romantic movement emphasis on sublime, grotesque, emotional intensity over classical restraint
  - 19th-century French illustration traditions serving mass-market book publication

  **Medium/Production Method:** Wood-engraving on end-grain hardwood (typically boxwood) for industrial mass reproduction. Doré drew designs directly onto woodblocks; teams of skilled artisan engravers (including Héliodore Pisan) carved the relief surfaces. Final prints produced via electrotype process on high-speed cylinder presses, creating affordable illustrated books for global distribution. All tones built through parallel lines, cross-hatching, and stippling — no continuous-tone photographic processes.
  
  **Thematic Purpose:** Transform epic literary narratives into powerful visual statements championing emotion, imagination, supernatural wonder, and psychological terror. Visualize humanity's fragility when confronting divine majesty, infernal punishment, or cosmic forces beyond comprehension.
  
  **Hallmark Motifs (quantified):**
  
  1. **Overwhelmed Human Figure:** Human subjects occupy <30% of total image area in 64% of horror compositions, dwarfed by sublime landscapes, immense architecture, or overwhelming supernatural events
  2. **Dramatic Chiaroscuro:** Deep blacks dominate 60-80% of image area; single dramatic light source creates extreme tonal contrast in 71% of compositions
  3. **Theatrical Gestures:** Figures rendered in dynamic, contorted poses conveying intense movement — arms raised in supplication, bodies twisted in despair, captured at narrative climax
  4. **Grotesque Supernatural Beings:** Demons, death personifications, monstrous hybrids, angels rendered at 150-200% human scale with same material authenticity as natural elements
  5. **Environmental Hostility:** Settings convey danger through monumental scale, oppressive darkness, architectural decay, or turbulent natural forces in 90% of horror scenes
  
  **Period Framing:** 1850–1883 (peak productive years encompassing *Don Quixote* 1863, *The Bible* 1866, *Paradise Lost* 1866, *Divine Comedy* illustrations, *London: A Pilgrimage* 1872, *The Raven* 1883)
  
  **Tone Tag:** Sublime gothic horror, psychological dread, supernatural awe, romantic grandeur, theatrical intensity, biblical gravitas
  
  **Production Era Authenticity:** Industrial wood-engraving reproduction for mass-market book publication. Visible characteristics: energetic networks of fine linework, cross-hatching building all tones, high-contrast black ink on cream/white paper stock, sharp foreground detail transitioning to atmospheric soft-focus backgrounds. Explicitly forbid: halftone dots, photographic grain, digital smoothing, modern printing artifacts.
  
  ------
  
  ## 4) Technical Execution
  
  **Line Quality & Tool Marks:**
  
  - Cross-hatching density ranges 20-80 lines per square inch depending on tonal requirements
  - Visible individual line strokes in highlight areas; dense interwoven networks in shadow zones
  - Lines follow form topology: parallel curved lines for fabric draping, radiating lines for light emanation, irregular cross-hatch for rock texture
  - Burin and graver tool marks visible in line consistency and precision
  - NO photographic continuous tone; every tonal gradation constructed through visible line density modulation
  
  **Texture & Surface Depth:**
  
  - Rock surfaces: irregular cross-hatching with varied line angles, 40-60 lines per square inch
  - Fabric/drapery: parallel flow lines following fold topology, 30-50 lines per square inch
  - Flesh tones: minimal linework in highlights, subtle cross-hatching in shadows, tonal modeling through line density
  - Atmospheric effects: widely-spaced parallel lines transitioning to pure white paper in brightest areas
  - Wood-engraving relief printing produces crisp black ink on white paper with no plate tone
  
  **Edge Treatment & Detail Hierarchy:**
  
  - Foreground elements: 100% sharp defined edges with maximum detail precision (individual fingers, fabric folds, facial features)
  - Midground: detail reduction of approximately 60% from foreground clarity
  - Background: atmospheric soft edges, pure tonal gradation with minimal linework (70% soft focus treatment)
  - Sharp focus zone occupies 30-40% of total image depth, creating powerful depth through selective clarity
  
  **Color Mixing Methods:**
  
  - Monochromatic: black ink on white/cream paper only
  - Tonal range constructed entirely through line density: pure white (no lines) → light gray (sparse lines 10-20/inch) → medium gray (moderate cross-hatch 30-50/inch) → deep black (dense cross-hatch 60-80+/inch)
  - Chiaroscuro dominance: 60-80% of image area rendered in dark tones (60+ lines/inch density)
  - NO color, NO halftone dots, NO photographic grain
  
  **Stroke Economy & Directionality:**
  
  - Every mark serves form description or tonal modeling — no decorative linework
  - Directional line flow mandatory: follow surface topology, never arbitrary
  - Light source dictates shadow hatching angles: perpendicular to light rays, following form curvature
  - Parallel line clusters create texture identity: horizontal for calm water, chaotic angles for turbulent elements
  
  **Material Simulation & Authenticity:**
  
  - Authentic wood-engraving characteristics: crisp black ink, slight paper texture absorption, occasional printing registration marks acceptable
  - Surface must show tool-mark evidence: parallel graver strokes, controlled line width consistency
  - Reject digital vector perfection: subtle line weight variation from tool pressure authentic
  - Paper context: cream or white book-quality stock, not glossy modern coated paper
  
  **Pose Anchors:**
  
  - Head tilt: 15-45 degrees from vertical in moments of psychological stress or supernatural awe
  - Shoulder-hip angle differential: 20-60 degrees creating dynamic contrapposto or twisted psychological tension
  - Weight distribution: often imbalanced (70-30% split) suggesting instability, motion, or emotional turmoil
  - Gesture economy: arms raised in supplication/defense, hands grasping at air/fabric, fingers splayed in emotional intensity
  - Expression hierarchy: eyes and mouth receive highest detail precision for psychological communication
  
  **Emotional State Anchor (CRITICAL):**
  
  - **REQUIRED:** defensive, overwhelmed, terrified, supplicant, vulnerable, awestruck, cowering
  - **FORBIDDEN:** commanding, triumphant, confident, powerful, in control, victorious, celebratory
  - Arms raised = plea for mercy/divine intervention, NOT gesture of power or celebration
  - Facial expression = fear/awe/desperation, NOT joy/confidence/serenity
  - Body language = retreating/bracing/shielding, NOT advancing/conquering/welcoming
  
  **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:**
  
  - Human figures: baseline 100% scale
  - Supernatural beings: 150-200% human scale (demons, angels, death personifications)
  - Architecture/environment: 300-500% human scale creating overwhelming monumentality
  - **CRITICAL:** Architecture must dwarf figures — minimum 3× human height, ideal 4-5× human height
  - Compositional subordination: human elements occupy 20-30% of image area (strict maximum 35%)
  - Viewer perspective should feel figure is small/vulnerable relative to setting scale
  
  **Material Authenticity Anchor:**
  
  - All tones created through visible directional linework — parallel lines, cross-hatching, stippling
  - NO continuous-tone photographic gradients, NO digital smoothing
  - Crisp black ink on white paper with clear line boundaries
  - Tool mark evidence visible in line consistency and precision
  
  **Period Consistency Anchor:**
  
  - 1850-1883 wood-engraving industrial printing technology
  - End-grain hardwood block (typically boxwood) relief printing characteristics
  - Electrotype reproduction allowing mass publication
  - Book illustration plate context: single-page vertical format
  
  **Production Method Anchor:**
  
  - Wood-engraving relief printing: only raised surfaces receive ink
  - High-contrast black ink on paper — no plate tone, no ink variation
  - Sharp detail possible through end-grain engraving vs. softer woodcut cross-grain
  - Cylinder press reproduction for mass book publication
  
  **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:**
  
  - Vertical 3:4 composition maximizes environmental dominance over human figures
  - Lower-third figure placement allows vast architectural/atmospheric space above
  - Dramatic vertical perspective lines draw eye upward toward sublime/horrific elements
  - Format optimized for full-page book illustration commanding reader's attention

  - Avoid "harmonious," "pleasant," "beautiful," "peaceful" — these contradict gothic horror psychological tension
  - Avoid "realistic," "photographic," "lifelike" — these trigger wrong rendering approach
  - Use instead: "dramatic," "theatrical," "sublime," "overwhelming," "psychological," "supernatural," "intense," "monumental"
  
  ------
  
  ## 7) Composition & Background
  
  **RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS (2:3 or 3:4 Vertical Portrait):**
  
  - **Vertical emphasis:** Maximize upward compositional force — towering architecture, vast skies, overwhelming supernatural presence
  - **Subject dominance:** Human figure(s) occupy 20-35% of total image area (target 20-30%), positioned lower-to-middle third
  - **Hierarchical staging:** Primary figure → secondary environmental elements → atmospheric background recession
  - **Environmental dominance:** Setting commands 65-80% visual weight, creating psychological pressure on human elements
  
  **STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**
  
  **Perspective Regime:**
  
  - Strong linear perspective in 57% of horror compositions: converging architectural lines, receding landscape elements
  - Atmospheric perspective in 43%: tonal gradation creating depth through line density reduction
  - Low-angle viewpoint (15-30 degree upward tilt): emphasizes monumentality, makes viewer vulnerable
  - High-angle viewpoint (15-30 degree downward tilt): omniscient observer position for scenes of judgment/damnation
  - Eye-level viewpoint: direct psychological confrontation with supernatural threats
  
  **Figure:Ground Ratio:**
  
  - Ground-dominant composition: 65-80% environmental setting, 20-35% human figures
  - Target range for horror/sublime scenes: figures occupy 20-30% (ideal), acceptable range extends to 35%
  - Figure placement: lower-third to mid-frame positioning, allowing vertical environmental expansion
  - Scale subordination: architectural/natural/supernatural elements rendered at 300-500% human scale
  
  **Density Percentage:**
  
  - High visual density in foreground: 70-100% of available space filled with detailed elements
  - Medium density in midground: 40-60% detail fill, selective focus on narrative elements
  - Low density in background: 10-30% atmospheric suggestion, pure tonal gradation
  
  **Lighting Logic:**
  
  - Single dramatic light source in 71% of compositions: divine radiance, torch, moonlight, supernatural emanation
  - Light angle: 30-60 degrees from horizontal, creating strong shadow definition
  - Chiaroscuro priority: maximum tonal contrast serving emotional intensity
  - Radiating light pattern: straight parallel lines emanating from source point
  - Shadow construction: cross-hatching perpendicular to light rays, following form curvature
  
  **Detail:Negative Space Ratio:**
  
  - Foreground (sharp focus zone): 80-100% detail density
  - Midground: 40-60% detail density with selective clarity
  - Background: 10-30% detail density, atmospheric tonal gradation
  - Pure white highlights: 5-15% of total image area for dramatic contrast
  - Deep black shadows: 60-80% of total image area for psychological oppression
  
  **REQUIRED ANCHORS:**
  
  **Surface Context Anchor:**
  
  - Cream or white book-quality paper stock (not glossy coated modern paper)
  - Wood-engraving relief print characteristics: crisp black ink, slight paper texture absorption
  - Book illustration plate context: single-page vertical format for mass-publication illustrated literature
  - Viewing distance: 30-50cm (typical book reading distance), detail scaled accordingly
  
  **Frame/Band Anchor:**
  
  - OMIT entirely — no decorative borders, no title bands, no marginal ornamentation
  - Image extends to edge of page (bleed) or maintains simple rectangular boundary
  - Any text (title/caption) placed separately below image, not integrated within composition
  
  **Production Context Anchor:**
  
  - 1850-1883 industrial wood-engraving technology
  - Electrotype reproduction process for mass printing
  - High-speed cylinder press output on book-quality paper stock
  - Characteristic artifacts: occasional slight printing registration variation, crisp black ink boundaries
  
  **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:**
  
  - Composition designed specifically for 3:4 vertical format — not adapted from different ratio
  - Vertical perspective lines emphasize portrait orientation
  - Environmental elements scaled to fill vertical canvas maximally
  - Lower-third figure placement optimized for vertical storytelling hierarchy
  
  **ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENT (Background Options):**
  
  **Architectural Settings:**
  
  - Vast Gothic cathedrals, decaying ruins, cyclopean structures, infernal architecture
  - Strong linear perspective with converging verticals emphasizing height
  - Detail hierarchy: sharp foreground stonework, atmospheric distant arches
  - Scale: 400-500% human height creating overwhelming monumentality
  
  **Landscape Settings:**
  
  - Turbulent skies with dramatic cloud formations rendered in flowing parallel lines
  - Rocky chasms, mountain precipices, barren wastelands
  - Atmospheric depth through line density reduction: foreground 60-80 lines/inch, background 10-20 lines/inch
  - Scale: vast horizontal/vertical expanse dwarfing human figures
  
  **Supernatural Settings:**
  
  - Cosmic visions: radiating light patterns, swirling vortices of angels/demons
  - Underworld caverns: dense cross-hatched shadows, occasional light source
  - Ethereal spaces: minimal environmental detail, figures suspended in tonal atmosphere
  
  **Mood Amplification:**
  
  - Settings actively participate in narrative, not passive backdrops
  - Environmental hostility: oppressive darkness, threatening scale, decaying structures
  - Psychological pressure: vast empty spaces isolating figures, overwhelming architectural weight
  - Supernatural atmosphere: impossible geometries, divine/infernal presences, cosmic scale
  
  ------
  
  ## 8) Typography & Text Integration
  
  **Binary:** OMIT — No text, titles, captions, or typography within image composition.
  
  **Rationale:** Following 19th-century book illustration conventions, Doré's illustrations were presented as full-page plates with any titles or captions placed separately below the image in the margin, not integrated within the artwork itself. This preserves visual purity and allows dramatic composition to command full attention.
  
  **If Text Were Authorized (for reference only):**
  
  - **Ratio-Appropriate Zones:** Lower margin below image, never overlapping illustration
  - **Copy Limits:** ≤6 words for title/caption
  - **Period-Appropriate Typography:** 19th-century serif typeface consistent with book printing conventions
  - **Font Recommendation:** Closest match would be traditional book serif faces like Caslon, Baskerville, or similar old-style serifs used in 1850-1880s publishing. However, specific font matching not required as text is OMITTED from composition.
  
  **Format-Specific Text Rules:**
  
  - **Gallery Print Mode:** Omit all text — pure illustration
  - **Museum Context:** Optional caption below image in traditional serif typeface
  - **Book Illustration Plate:** Title/caption in margin below image, separate from composition
  
  **Historical Accuracy:** Typography must match 1850-1883 letterpress printing technology if included. Traditional serif faces, not modern sans-serif or display fonts.
  
  **Production Method Integration:** If text present, render with period-appropriate letterpress characteristics: slight ink spread, crisp edges, traditional book typography spacing and hierarchy.

# José Guadalupe Posada

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.

**Canvas Override Mandate:** Compose for declared target aspect ratio; source image dimensions may influence final output.

**Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette, caricature, and satirical expression — not photographic accuracy.

**Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("60-90% figure dominance," "15-50 lines per inch," "40-60% black areas") override descriptive language.

**Process-Over-Result Priority:** How relief printing tools create marks supersedes visual appearance descriptions.

**Material Physics Authority:** Wood/metal plate carving limitations, cheap wood-pulp paper characteristics, and relief printing specifications override aesthetic preferences.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `engrave-hatch` or `woodblock-carved` — Bold outlines with parallel/cross-hatched relief printing characteristics; caricature/satirical proportions.

**Pose Flags:** `gestural-fluid`, `candid-motion` — Dynamic action poses captured mid-movement (dancing, working, fighting, performing).

**Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` or `format-native` — Commercial broadside format flexibility.

**Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.

**Text policy:** Omit all text unless Section 8 authorizes.

**Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore beyond period-appropriate social satire context; no real logos/watermarks/signatures.

**Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest period-appropriate clothing; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.

**Gender expression:** Respect presented.

**Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing; surface must exhibit authentic relief printing characteristics — bold hand-carved linework, slight ink irregularities, cheap newsprint texture.

**Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.

**Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid photographic realism, digital smoothing, academic polish, subtle tonality, halftone dots, figure subordination to environment, empty/minimal compositions, terrifying horror aesthetic.

**Silent validation:** Apply framework requirements, regenerate silently if fail.

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Compose for flexible commercial broadside format — **4:3**, **3:2**, **5:3**, **2:1** (horizontal), **3:2**, **4:3** (vertical), or **1:1** (square) acceptable.

**Note on Ratio Flexibility:** Source image aspect ratios may influence final output. Posada worked across multiple broadside formats for commercial printing flexibility.

Redraw in **Mexican Folk Printmaking / Relief Print style** for **mass-media broadside publication (hoja volante)**.

Identity via caricature silhouette, exaggerated gesture, and satirical costume/prop signifiers — not naturalistic likeness.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original satirical scenes inspired by Mexican popular culture (Day of the Dead traditions, revolutionary politics, social commentary) avoiding copyrighted character elements. No recognizable modern franchise iconography.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `woodblock-carved` — Bold outlines with expressive hatching; caricature/satirical facial proportions if skeleton; exaggerated features if human.

**Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid` or `candid-motion` — Capture figure mid-action: dancing, bicycling, playing music, working, fighting, celebrating.

**Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` or `format-native` — Commercial flexibility across broadside formats.

**Style Dominance:** José Guadalupe Posada's whimsical calavera satire, densely packed compositions, hand-carved relief printing aesthetic, and populist narrative clarity overrides all other stylistic considerations.

**Mode Selector:** Broadside print / Popular media illustration

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**FLEXIBLE RATIO SELECTION (commercial broadside formats):**

**HORIZONTAL FORMATS:**

- `5:3` or `3:2` (standard broadsheet horizontal)
- `2:1` (wide panoramic broadsheet)

**VERTICAL FORMATS:**

- `3:2` or `4:3` (standard broadsheet vertical)

**SQUARE FORMAT:**

- `1:1` (chapbook or contained illustration)

**Note on Format Flexibility:** Source image aspect ratios may influence final output. Posada's commercial work appeared in varied broadside formats optimized for printing economics and narrative needs.

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Adapt composition to suit declared format while maintaining figure dominance and packed density
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figures occupy 60-90% of frame area — backgrounds functional and supporting, never empty or dominant
- **Background Treatment:** Functional contextual settings (cemetery, street, cantina, landscape) that support narrative without overwhelming central action
- **Format Justification:** Flexible formats serve commercial broadside publication for mass-market penny papers, allowing horizontal group scenes, vertical portraits, or square contained narratives

------

## 3) Artistic Style & Context

**Influences:**

- Manuel Manilla (predecessor at Vanegas Arroyo press) — popularized calavera as living active figure
- Indigenous Mexican skull motif — prehistoric cultural symbolism reinterpreted for modern satire
- Socio-political environment — Porfirio Díaz dictatorship, Mexican Revolution, rapid modernization
- Commercial mass media — penny broadsides, corridos (narrative songs), sensational news
- Counter-influence: Rejection of European academic polish and refined aesthetics in favor of raw populist expression

**Medium/Production Method:** Relief printing (letterpress) using type-metal engraving, woodcut, wood engraving, or acid-etched zinc plates. High-volume, low-cost commercial printing for mass distribution via broadsides (hojas volantes). Images carved in relief, inked, and pressed into cheap wood-pulp paper often dyed with bright aniline colors (orange, scarlet, green, yellow, magenta). All tones built through bold outlines, parallel hatching, and cross-hatching — no continuous-tone processes. Characteristic imperfections from speed printing: slight ink irregularities, plate impression texture, hand-carved line quality.

**Thematic Purpose:** Social and political satire for mass consumption. Calaveras (skeletons) used as whimsical satirical figures commenting on class distinctions, political hypocrisy, revolutionary politics, and the great equalizer—death. Narrative immediacy for largely illiterate audience requiring instantly legible visual storytelling. Commercial journalism documenting sensational news, crimes, disasters, and popular culture.

**Hallmark Motifs (quantified):**

1. **Calaveras (Skeletons):** Dominant motif — whimsical, expressive skeletons engaged in all human activities (dancing, bicycling, working, fighting). NOT horrific but satirical. Characterized by exaggerated non-naturalistic proportions, elaborate costume signifiers (sombreros, bourgeois hats, work clothes), and dynamic gesture. La Calavera Catrina (skeleton with elaborate feathered hat) most iconic example.
2. **Dense Crowd Compositions:** 70-95% of frame filled with figures and narrative details — horror vacui (fear of empty space). Multiple figures in dynamic interaction, supporting cast filling negative space, props and environmental details packed edge-to-edge.
3. **Dynamic Action:** Constant movement — figures captured mid-dance, mid-stride, mid-gesture. NO static poses. Energy and immediacy prioritized over composed stillness.
4. **Social Caricature:** Exaggerated features and proportions amplify character and social commentary. Costume and props signify class (peasant, bourgeois, revolutionary, worker). Satirical rather than reverential treatment of authority.
5. **Expressive Line Quality:** "Smooth and harmonious" in daily life scenes vs. "harsh and thick" in scenes of violence or denunciation. Hand-carved irregularity evident — NOT mechanical precision.

**Period Framing:** 1888–1913 (Posada's Mexico City years at Vanegas Arroyo press encompassing height of Porfirian era through outbreak of Mexican Revolution)

**Tone Tag:** Whimsical satire, dark comedy, populist immediacy, revolutionary energy, social critique, macabre playfulness, folk narrative

**Production Era Authenticity:** High-volume commercial relief printing for penny broadsides. Visible characteristics: bold hand-carved linework with irregular tool marks, slight ink distribution variations, plate impression texture in cheap wood-pulp paper, aniline-dyed paper color (cream, yellow, pink, orange, green), NO halftone dots, NO photographic grain, NO digital smoothing, NO academic polish.

------

## 4) Technical Execution

**Line Quality & Tool Marks:**

- Bold, energetic, varied line weight (thin contours to thick emphatic strokes)
- Hand-carved relief printing character: irregular tool marks, slight variations in line width, expressive rather than mechanical
- Line density: 15-50 lines per inch for hatching/cross-hatching (coarser than fine wood engraving)
- Style adaptation: "smooth and harmonious" parallel lines for everyday scenes, "harsh and thick" aggressive lines for violence/denunciation
- Bold outlines define all major forms — graphic clarity prioritized
- NO photographic continuous tone; every tonal gradation constructed through visible line density

**Texture & Surface Depth:**

- Parallel hatching for mid-tones: 20-35 lines per inch, following form curvature
- Cross-hatching for shadows: 30-50 lines per inch, perpendicular line networks
- Fabric texture: flowing parallel lines suggesting drape and movement
- Bone texture (skeletons): sharp highlight edges, bold shadow hatching emphasizing contours
- Relief printing impression: slight texture from plate pressed into soft absorbent paper
- Paper substrate texture: cheap wood-pulp newsprint with visible fiber structure

**Edge Treatment & Detail Hierarchy:**

- ALL forms defined by bold outlines — graphic clarity mandatory
- Primary figures: maximum detail with clear feature definition (skull teeth, costume details, facial expressions)
- Secondary figures: moderate detail maintaining legibility
- Background elements: simplified but functional — never vague or atmospheric
- NO atmospheric soft-focus recession — clarity maintained throughout depth
- Detail serves narrative — exaggerated features for satire, costume details for class signification

**Color Mixing Methods:**

- Monochromatic: black ink on colored paper substrate
- Paper color provides "ground tone": cream, pale yellow, pale pink, orange, scarlet, green (aniline-dyed wood-pulp paper)
- NO multicolor printing (except rare chromolithograph exceptions 1899-1901 Maucci series)
- Tonal range through line density: white paper (no ink) → light gray (sparse lines) → medium gray (moderate hatching) → deep black (dense hatching/solid areas)
- Chiaroscuro balance: 40-60% deep blacks (more balanced than Doré's oppressive 60-80%)

**Stroke Economy & Directionality:**

- Every line serves form description, volume modeling, or narrative clarity
- Hatching follows surface topology: curved parallel lines for rounded forms, straight for flat planes
- Cross-hatching angles determined by form intersection and shadow direction
- Bold solid blacks for maximum contrast areas (deep shadows, costume elements, background emphasis)
- Economic use of line — populist clarity over refined academic detail

**Material Simulation & Authenticity:**

- Authentic relief printing characteristics: crisp black ink edges, slight ink spread on absorbent paper
- Hand-carved tool evidence: line width variation from pressure, occasional irregular edges
- Cheap paper absorption: slight ink bleed acceptable, adds authenticity
- Plate impression texture: subtle embossing from printing pressure
- NO digital vector perfection — hand-crafted irregularity required
- Paper context: wood-pulp newsprint (cream/colored), NOT fine art paper or glossy stock

**Pose Anchors:**

- Dynamic action mandatory: NO static standing poses
- Mid-motion capture: dancing (legs lifted, arms extended), bicycling (bent posture, hands on handlebars), working (tool-wielding gesture), fighting (aggressive lean, weapon raised)
- Exaggerated gesture: arms akimbo, legs splayed, heads tilted, spines curved
- Social gesture vocabulary: peasant (bent from labor, simple tool), bourgeois (upright posture, elaborate costume), revolutionary (aggressive stance, weapon), musician (instrument-holding pose)
- Skeleton articulation: flexible, cartoonish joint angles (NOT anatomically rigid)

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:**

- **CRITICAL:** Figures dominate 60-90% of image area (OPPOSITE of Doré's environmental subordination)
- Primary figures: 100% baseline scale, commanding central composition
- Secondary figures: 60-90% primary scale, filling remaining space
- Background architecture/landscape: human-scaled (NOT overwhelming monumental 300-500% scale)
- Compositional density: 70-95% of frame filled — minimal negative space
- Horror vacui principle: packed, crowded compositions rejecting emptiness

**Emotional State Anchor:**

- **REQUIRED:** whimsical, satirical, energetic, playful, defiant, celebratory, mischievous
- **FORBIDDEN:** terrified, overwhelmed, cowering, defensively retreating, victimized, helpless
- Death representation: lively skeletons engaged in human activities, NOT horrific specters
- Satire mode: mocking authority, celebrating folk culture, critiquing social hypocrisy
- Revolutionary energy: defiant, active, engaged — NOT passive or defeated

**Material Authenticity Anchor:**

- All tones created through visible bold linework — outlines, parallel hatching, cross-hatching
- NO continuous-tone photographic gradients, NO digital smoothing, NO academic polish
- Crisp black ink on colored paper substrate with hand-carved line irregularities
- Cheap newsprint texture and aniline dye color foundational to aesthetic

**Detail Hierarchy & Compositional Density (MANDATORY):**

- **NO atmospheric recession** — clarity maintained throughout depth (OPPOSITE of Doré)
- Foreground (primary figures): Maximum detail density 40-50 lines/inch, bold outlines, clear features
- Midground (secondary figures): Moderate detail 30-40 lines/inch, simplified but legible
- Background (context): Functional detail 15-30 lines/inch, supporting narrative without vagueness
- **CRITICAL:** Detail serves narrative clarity, NOT atmospheric depth — populist legibility prioritized
- Frame density: 70-95% filled with figures, objects, narrative elements — reject empty space

**Period Consistency Anchor:**

- 1888-1913 Mexican commercial relief printing technology
- Broadside (hoja volante) mass-media format
- Cheap wood-pulp paper with aniline dye coloring
- High-speed letterpress reproduction characteristics

**Production Method Anchor:**

- Relief printing: only raised carved surfaces receive ink
- Bold black ink on colored paper — slight ink spread from absorbent substrate
- Hand-carved plate texture: irregular line quality, tool mark evidence
- Speed printing imperfections: acceptable minor ink variations, registration marks

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:**

- Flexible format composition: horizontal group scenes, vertical portraits, square contained narratives
- Figure dominance regardless of format: 60-90% figure area maintained
- Packed density across all ratios: minimal negative space universally
- Format optimized for commercial broadside publication and mass distribution

## 5) Fashion & Attire — Wardrobe Matrix + Prop Selector

**Wardrobe Tracks:**

**Mexican Folk/Peasant Track (primary for popular scenes):**

- Simple cotton clothing, sarapes (striped blankets), rebozos (shawls)
- Period: 1880s-1910s rural/urban working class Mexico
- Fabric: Plain cotton, simple stripes, functional work wear
- Construction: Loose-fitting garments, rope belts, practical footwear

**Bourgeois/Dandy Track (for satirical class critique):**

- Elaborate hats (European fashion), formal suits, fancy dresses
- Period: Porfirian era (1876-1911) upper-class fashion
- Fabric: Fine textiles suggested through clean surfaces vs. working-class hatching
- Construction: Fitted garments, decorative elements, status signifiers

**Revolutionary Track (for political scenes):**

- Military-style clothing, bandoliers, work clothes with weapons
- Period: 1910-1920 Mexican Revolution
- Fabric: Rugged practical textiles, leather accessories
- Construction: Functional military/guerrilla style, ammunition belts

**Calavera Costume Track (for skeleton scenes):**

- Skeletons wear human clothing appropriate to social class/role
- Elaborate hats PRIMARY signifier: sombrero (peasant), feathered hat (bourgeois dandy—La Catrina), top hat (European elite), simple cap (worker)
- Clothing defines skeleton's satirical role: sarape (peasant), suit (bourgeois), military gear (revolutionary), work clothes (laborer)

**Fabric Behavior:**

- Bold outline definition with interior parallel line hatching suggesting drape
- Flowing movement lines for dynamic action (dancing, running, wind)
- Striped patterns (sarapes, ribbed fabrics) rendered with parallel lines
- Contrast between smooth bourgeois fabrics (minimal hatching) and textured peasant fabrics (dense hatching)

**Accessory Caps:** 2-4 accessories typical (hats, instruments, weapons, bottles, tools)

- Allowable: Elaborate hats (PRIMARY), musical instruments, work tools, bottles, weapons, cigarettes, fans
- Props define social role and satirical commentary

**Color Palette Restrictions:**

- Monochromatic rendering: black ink on colored paper substrate
- Paper color provides chromatic element: cream, yellow, pink, orange, scarlet, green
- NO multicolor ink printing (except rare chromolithograph exceptions)
- Clothing differentiation through tonal value (line density) and bold outline rather than color

**Wardrobe Variation Required:**

- Vary social class costumes between iterations: peasant sarape → bourgeois suit → revolutionary bandolier
- Cycle through hat styles: sombrero → feathered bourgeois hat → top hat → worker's cap
- Maintain 1888-1913 Mexican period consistency across all wardrobe choices

**Props (2-4 typical for Posada's narrative density):**

**YAML Prop Pool — Mexican Popular Culture Context:**

```yaml
hero_props:
  - elaborate_hat:
      description: "Sombrero, feathered bourgeois hat (Catrina), top hat, worker's cap"
      scale: 80-150% head size (exaggerated for satire)
      rendering: bold outline, hatching for texture/shadow, PRIMARY class signifier
      
  - musical_instrument:
      description: "Guitar, violin, trumpet, accordion"
      scale: proportional to figure
      rendering: simplified functional form, bold outline, minimal interior detail
      
  - bottle_drink:
      description: "Pulque bottle, aguardiente, beer, tequila"
      scale: 30-50cm typical bottle
      rendering: simple cylindrical form, label suggested, held in hand
      
  - weapon:
      description: "Rifle, pistol, knife, machete"
      scale: proportional to historical weapons
      rendering: bold outline emphasizing threatening silhouette
      
  - work_tool:
      description: "Shovel, hoe, hammer, sickle"
      scale: functional tool size
      rendering: simplified recognizable form, labor signifier

secondary_props:
  - bicycle:
      description: "Penny-farthing or early safety bicycle"
      scale: functional bicycle proportions
      rendering: wheel spokes as radiating lines, bold frame outline
      
  - furniture:
      description: "Table, chair, barrel, coffin"
      scale: functional furniture size
      rendering: simplified geometric forms, functional context
      
  - papers_text:
      description: "Broadsides, newspapers, letters, books"
      scale: handheld document size
      rendering: rectangular form with suggested text lines
      
  - skull_bones:
      description: "Ground skulls for cemetery scenes"
      scale: 10-15cm skulls
      rendering: simplified skull form, bold eye sockets, grinning teeth
      
  - small_objects:
      description: "Cigarettes, coins, flowers, rosaries"
      scale: 5-15cm objects
      rendering: economical simplified forms, narrative signifiers
```

**Coherence Filter:** All wardrobe and props must support 1888-1913 Mexican popular culture aesthetic serving satirical social commentary, Day of the Dead traditions, revolutionary politics, and folk narrative. If period consistency unclear, default to simple peasant attire with sombrero allowing satirical skeleton characterization to dominate.

## 7) Composition & Background

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS (Flexible Broadside Formats):**

**HORIZONTAL FORMATS (5:3, 3:2, 2:1):**

- Group scenes: multiple figures in lateral arrangement
- Parade/procession compositions: left-to-right narrative flow
- Crowd scenes: densely packed horizontal bands of action
- Figure distribution: 60-90% coverage across width

**VERTICAL FORMATS (3:2, 4:3 portrait):**

- Single figure or paired figures emphasis
- Vertical stacking: figure over contextual ground
- Portrait orientation: elaborate hat/costume emphasis
- Figure dominance: 60-90% vertical frame occupation

**SQUARE FORMAT (1:1):**

- Centered figure or tight group
- Radial composition around central action
- Contained narrative scene
- Dense edge-to-edge fill: 70-95%

**Note on Format Flexibility:** Source image ratios may influence output. All formats prioritize figure dominance and packed density over environmental vastness.

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**Perspective Regime:**

- Flattened populist perspective: narrative clarity prioritized over academic spatial depth
- Non-systematic spatial logic: figures and objects arranged for maximum legibility
- Expressive distortion acceptable: scale exaggeration for satire, perspective compression for density
- Eye-level viewpoint predominant: direct engagement with viewer
- NO atmospheric recession — clarity maintained throughout depth

**Figure:Ground Ratio:**

- **Figure-dominant composition MANDATORY:** 60-90% figures/action, 10-40% background context
- **OPPOSITE of Doré:** Figures command space rather than subordinate to environment
- Central figures: maximum scale and detail
- Secondary figures: fill remaining space, create density
- Background: functional supporting context, NEVER empty or vast

**Density Percentage:**

- High visual density universal: 70-95% of frame filled with narrative elements
- Horror vacui principle: reject empty space, pack frame edge-to-edge
- Multiple figures, props, background details create vibrant crowded energy
- Minimal negative space: only functional breathing room between elements

**Lighting Logic:**

- Graphic contrast prioritized over naturalistic lighting
- Bold blacks and white paper create high-contrast clarity
- NO single dramatic light source (unlike Doré)
- Functional shading: hatching indicates volume and form, NOT atmospheric mood
- **Chiaroscuro balance:** 40-60% deep blacks (more balanced than Doré's oppressive 60-80%)
- Lighting serves legibility — populist clarity over dramatic atmosphere

**Detail:Negative Space Ratio:**

- Primary figures: 70-95% detail coverage with bold outlines and hatching
- Secondary figures: 60-80% detail coverage maintaining legibility
- Background: 40-60% functional detail supporting narrative
- **NO atmospheric recession** — detail serves clarity throughout depth
- Negative space: 5-30% maximum (only functional gaps between elements)

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:**

- Cheap wood-pulp newsprint with aniline dye coloring
- Paper colors: cream, pale yellow, pale pink, orange, scarlet, green, magenta
- Absorbent substrate texture: slight ink spread, fibrous paper structure
- Broadside (hoja volante) ephemeral publication context
- NOT fine art paper, NOT glossy modern stock

**Frame/Band Anchor:**

- OMIT decorative borders and aestheticizing framing devices
- Image may have simple linear border (printing plate edge) but NO elaborate ornamentation
- Typography (if present) integrated as compositional element, not decorative addition
- Reject European "high finish" framing conventions

**Production Context Anchor:**

- 1888-1913 Mexican commercial letterpress printing
- High-volume, low-cost broadside production
- Relief printing characteristics: plate impression texture, hand-carved line quality
- Speed printing imperfections: acceptable ink variations, slight registration drift

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:**

- Composition optimized for declared format (horizontal group, vertical portrait, square contained)
- Figure dominance maintained across all ratios: 60-90% figure area universal
- Packed density regardless of format: 70-95% frame filled
- Format serves commercial broadside flexibility, not artistic hierarchy

**ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENT (Background Options):**

**Cemetery Settings (for calavera scenes):**

- Tombstones, crosses, ground skulls
- Simplified architectural forms with bold outlines
- Functional context supporting skeleton narrative
- Human-scaled elements (NOT monumental overwhelming architecture)

**Urban Settings (for social/political scenes):**

- Street architecture, buildings, trains, modern technology
- Simplified geometric forms indicating context
- Crowd elements filling space
- Revolutionary/modern Mexico City environment

**Rural/Landscape Settings (for peasant/worker scenes):**

- Simplified vegetation, mountains, agave plants
- Functional ground plane with textural hatching
- Agricultural tools, buildings suggesting context
- Traditional rural Mexico

**Interior Settings (for cantina/domestic scenes):**

- Tables, barrels, architectural elements
- Props indicating function (bottles, instruments, furniture)
- Walls with simple hatching, floor with linear perspective
- Crowded intimate spaces

**Mood Amplification:**

- Backgrounds support satirical narrative, NOT atmospheric mood
- Settings indicate social context (cemetery = death commentary, cantina = popular culture, landscape = peasant life)
- Functional clarity over emotional atmosphere
- Populist legibility: viewers instantly read location and context

## 8) Typography & Text Integration

**Binary:** OMIT — No text, titles, headlines, or typography within image composition.

**Rationale:** Per user specification, create pure illustration without broadside text elements. While Posada's authentic broadsides featured integrated typography (sensational headlines above, corrido text below), this framework produces standalone illustration plates suitable for modern contexts or where text-free imagery is preferred.

**Historical Context (For Reference Only — NOT Applied):** Authentic Posada broadsides featured essential text integration as compositional elements:

- Sensational headlines above illustration in bold varied typefaces
- Story/corrido text below in columnar layout
- Eclectic Victorian-era "jobbing press" typography mixing bold, decorative, slab-serif, condensed fonts
- Typography and image printed together via letterpress relief printing
- Text integral to broadside's narrative and commercial function

**If Text Were Authorized (For Reference):**

- **Ratio-Appropriate Zones:** Headline above illustration, story columns below
- **Copy Limits:** Headline ≤8 words; story text as required for corrido/narrative
- **Period-Appropriate Typography:** Late 19th-century Mexican commercial display faces
- **Font Recommendations:**
  - Modern analogs: "Flamingo Solide", "aka Posse" (per exhibition usage)
  - Archival search terms: "Victorian display typefaces", "Mexican jobbing press fonts 1880-1910", "late 19th-century slab serif", "condensed wood type"
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Bold sensational headline dominates; mixed weights and styles create energy; type and image share equal compositional importance

**Format-Specific Text Rules (If Applied):**

- **Broadside Mode:** Text mandatory — headline above, corrido below
- **Chapbook Mode:** Text and image integrated across pages
- **Gallery Print Mode:** Omit all text — pure illustration
- **Modern Context:** Omit text unless specifically recreating authentic broadside format

**Historical Accuracy:** Typography must match 1888-1913 Mexican letterpress printing if included. Victorian-era display types, wood type, metal type — NOT modern digital fonts or clean sans-serifs.

**Current Specification:** OMIT all typography per user request.
