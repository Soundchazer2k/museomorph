- **Adams color revolution** - expanded 64-color palette with restored "tone yellow" (25%, 50% screens) enabling natural flesh tones instead of flat pink
- **Hard color separations** - distinct boundaries between color areas with minimal blending, characteristic registration drift of 0.5-1mm creating period-authentic imperfections
- **High contrast chiaroscuro** - deep solid blacks (100% K) contrasted with bright highlight areas using stark 80-20 light/dark ratios
- **Environmental color logic** - warm interior building lighting (yellows 50-75% + magentas 25%), cool moonlight/sky (cyans 75% + magentas 25%), authentic material colors
- **Visible printing artifacts** - slight color misregistration, dot gain in shadow areas, paper show-through in highlight areas typical of newsprint reproduction

- **Multiple-character compositions prioritized** - feature 2-3 characters minimum in complex overlapping relationships: one character supporting/catching another, figures physically connected through grabbing, pulling, or falling together
- **Panel-breaking extensions mandatory** - cape edges, extended arms, weapons, or flowing hair must extend beyond traditional frame boundaries by 10-20% into white space or margin areas
- **Asymmetrical character arrangements** - reject centered compositions, place main figure at 1/3 rule positioning with supporting characters creating triangular or diagonal compositional flow
- **Tilted horizon compositions** - rotate entire scene 10-20 degrees off vertical axis to create psychological tension and dynamic energy
- **Environmental integration** - characters interacting with architectural elements (leaning on buildings, swinging from structures) with accurate perspective and scale relationships
- **Emotional authenticity** - faces showing genuine fear, determination, exhaustion, or pain with specific micro-expressions: furrowed brows, clenched jaw, worried eyes, stressed facial muscles

**Scale Hierarchy:** Photorealistic proportions emphasizing anatomical accuracy over stylized exaggeration (realistic anatomy 85-95%, dramatic lighting 70%, sophisticated detail 60%)

**Material Authenticity:** Authentic 1970s commercial printing techniques with painterly pencil methodology - no modern digital effects

### **Constraints**

**Canvas Negatives (≥2):**

- "original aspect ratio", "source dimensions", "unmodified framing"
- "bigfoot cartoon anatomy", "simplified proportions", "stylized comic book rendering"
- "flat lighting", "amateur line quality", "unsophisticated color"
- "basic halftone patterns", "limited color palette", "primitive printing quality"
- "cartoonish facial features", "exaggerated anatomy", "unrealistic proportions"
- "computer-generated gradients", "digital airbrushing", "smooth color blending", "modern digital effects"
- "static centered poses", "conventional superhero stances", "predictable viewing angles"

**Canvas Positives (≥2):**

- "exactly 2:3 ratio", "recomposed for dramatic realism impact"
- "extreme foreshortening 25-45 degrees", "Adams signature kick composition", "unconventional viewing angles"
- "period-authentic 1970s four-color process", "flat color separations", "halftone-only gradients"
- "commercial illustration sophistication", "expanded 64-color palette utilization"
- "sophisticated halftone screens 85-100 LPI", "realistic material rendering"

**Vocabulary warnings**: Avoid "cartoon," "stylized," "simplified" unless contextually subverting. Avoid "exaggerated," "unrealistic" unless serving dramatic staging purpose.
