### 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

- `4:3` (classical landscape for Catalonian dreamscapes)
- `3:4` (portrait for psychological studies)
- `4:5` (Instagram format adapted for modern surreal portraiture)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method**: extend-background with Mediterranean/Catalonian landscape elements
- **Spatial Allocation**: Subject placement according to Renaissance golden ratio within surreal context
- **Background Treatment**: Seamless extension of hyperrealistic dream environments with atmospheric perspective
- **Format Justification**: Canvas ratio optimized for Dalí's classical composition within surreal narrative structure

------

### 3) Artistic Style & Context

**Medium/Production Method**: Oil on canvas with Renaissance-level technical precision using classical preparation methods. Canvas primed with traditional gesso; oil paints mixed with linseed oil for extended workability (2-3 week drying time between layers). Fat-over-lean technique with invisible brushwork achieving photographic surface quality.

**Thematic Purpose**: Exploration of unconscious mind through Freudian psychoanalysis rendered with hyperrealistic precision. Transformation of rational reality through paranoiac-critical method revealing hidden psychological associations.

**Period Framing**: European Surrealism (1920s-1980s) with specific focus on Catalonian cultural elements and Mediterranean environment. Peak technical period emphasizing "hand-painted dream photographs."

**5 Hallmark Motifs with Quantified Specifications**:

1. **Melting/Soft Objects**: Timepieces, organic forms liquefied while maintaining structural recognition - 30-40% form retention
2. **Impossible Perspectives**: Classical Renaissance perspective applied to dream logic - single-point perspective with multiple horizon lines
3. **Symbolic Integration**: Personal iconography (ants=death, eggs=hope, crutches=support) - 2-3 symbols maximum per composition
4. **Hyperrealistic Precision**: Photographic accuracy in impossible scenarios - every surface rendered with scientific illustration detail
5. **Catalonian Landscapes**: Mediterranean coastal elements with golden light - specific reference to Port Lligat geography

**Tone Tag**: Dreamlike precision, psychological revelation, classical technique applied to irrational content.

**Innovation Line**: Paranoiac-critical method enabling systematic access to unconscious imagery through controlled paranoid states.

------

### 4) Technical Execution

**Anchors with Measurement Specifications**:

**Line Quality & Tool Marks**: Invisible brushwork achieved through multiple glazing layers. Individual brush strokes completely eliminated through wet-blending technique. Surface smoothness comparable to Renaissance masters (Meissonier precision level).

**Color Mixing Methods**: Oil paints mixed with linseed oil in 3:1 ratio for extended working time. Colors built through transparent glazes over detailed underpainting. No impasto texture - completely smooth surface finish.

**Texture Thickness Specifications**: Paint layer thickness 2-3mm maximum. No visible brush texture. Surface achieves porcelain-like smoothness through multiple glazing applications.

**Edge Treatment**: Edges rendered with scientific illustration precision. No lost edges - every form maintains clear delineation even within soft/melting transformations.

**Detail Hierarchy with Proportional Specifications**:

- Primary subject: 100% photographic detail
- Secondary elements: 85% detail level
- Background: 70% detail but atmospheric perspective maintained
- Symbolic elements: 100% precision regardless of scale

**Material Simulation with Authentic Characteristics**: Every surface (fabric, metal, organic matter, landscape) rendered with material-specific light behavior. Reflection, refraction, and subsurface scattering calculated for photographic accuracy.

**Pose Anchors**:

- Head tilt: Classical contrapposto angles (15-20 degrees from vertical)
- Shoulder-hip differential: Renaissance proportion standards
- Weight distribution: 60/40 classical stance adapted to surreal ground plane
- Gesture economy: Maximum 2 symbolic gestures integrated naturally

**Scale Hierarchy**: Proportional relationships follow Renaissance standards unless specifically distorted for psychological effect (elongations measured as percentages: neck elongation 150%, limb extensions 120-180%).

**Material Authenticity**: Authentic oil painting surface characteristics - no digital simulation. Paint behavior must follow physical properties of oil medium including drying crack patterns and aging characteristics.

**Period Consistency**: All technical methods documented from 1929-1980 Dalí studio practice. No techniques unavailable during historical period.

**Canvas Adaptation**: Composition specifically designed for declared aspect ratio with background elements extending naturally to fill frame without cropping or distortion.

### 7) Composition & Background

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS**:

- **For Portrait Ratios (3:4, 4:5)**: Metamorphic figure dominance ≥70% with impossible spatial environment integration, archetypal transformation emphasis through vertical format supporting ceremonial narrative
- **For Landscape Ratios (4:3, 5:3, 16:9)**: Spatially impossible environmental context ≥50%, theatrical staging distribution across horizontal space following dream-stage logic rather than realistic perspective
- **For Square (1:1)**: Central archetypal focus with balanced impossible element distribution, equal weight between metamorphic figure and spatially impossible environmental context

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION**:

- **Perspective Regime**: Impossible spatial organization defying realistic perspective while maintaining tempera precision. Theatrical staging principles creating dream-environments supporting archetypal narrative rather than naturalistic space.
- **Grid/Symmetry**: Ceremonial arrangement following symbolic narrative logic rather than realistic spatial organization. Archetypal positioning emphasizing ritual function over naturalistic gesture.
- **Figure:Ground %**: Archetypal figures 60-70%, spatially impossible environmental context 30-40%, atmospheric areas supporting symbolic narrative - every surface carrying transformation significance through tempera precision
- **Density %**: Moderate symbolic density supporting archetypal clarity - 60-70% detailed content with atmospheric integration allowing ceremonial contemplation rather than decorative oversaturation
- **Lighting Logic**: Impossible atmospheric lighting creating symbolic mood through multiple inconsistent sources. Tempera precision applied to lighting that supports archetypal narrative rather than realistic illumination.
- **Detail:Negative Space Ratio**: Balanced archetypal relationship supporting symbolic storytelling - atmospheric depth allowing ceremonial engagement with metamorphic elements integrated through tempera precision

**REQUIRED ANCHORS**:

- **Surface Context**: Tempera and oil on wood panels/canvas with smooth gesso preparation and enamel-like precision characteristics requiring intimate symbolic viewing engagement
- **Frame/Band Anchor**: No external frames - composition exists within canvas boundaries following archetypal presentation conventions
- **Production Context**: 1937-2011 British-Mexican exile studio methods with authentic tempera technique research and metamorphic symbolic practice integration
- **Ratio Enforcement**: Composition designed specifically for declared aspect ratio with impossible spatial narrative elements following theatrical staging principles rather than realistic architectural organization

### 8) Typography & Text Integration

**Binary**: Omit entirely - Carrington's metamorphic surrealism emphasized pure archetypal visual transformation without text integration

**Text Policy**: No typography permitted. All metamorphic and symbolic content communicated through visual transformation and impossible spatial integration. Any text elements would violate authentic Carrington aesthetic approach focusing on archetypal visual language and symbolic storytelling through tempera precision alone.

**Historical Accuracy**: Carrington's gallery works excluded text integration - maintained metamorphic surrealist art purity through visual archetypal communication exclusively. Symbolic transformation and impossible spatial content transmitted through tempera technique, metamorphic integration, and theatrical staging rather than written language.
