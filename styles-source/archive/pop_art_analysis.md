**Based on visual analysis of 1962-1969 Factory era silkscreen works**

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via appropriated media imagery flattened to graphic shapes.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("registration drift 2-3mm", "ink coverage 85-95%") override descriptive language ("slightly misaligned", "uneven").
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How silkscreen process is simulated supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Custom Flag Authorization:** Warhol-specific flags permitted when standard options fail authenticity requirements.
- **Material Physics Authority:** Silkscreen ink properties, canvas substrate, and printing mechanics override aesthetic preferences.
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real celebrity likenesses; no actual copyrighted brand logos or trademarked characters.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral (21+).
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented.
- **Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters, Instagram effects, or modern post-processing that mimics silkscreen; surface must exhibit authentic mechanical reproduction characteristics.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** Use 1960s Factory-era silkscreen printing methods with characteristic registration drift, uneven ink coverage, and halftone dot patterns - avoid modern digital perfection.
- **Composition boundaries:** No frames outside the canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, watermarks, or credits.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid painterly autopilot, HDR smoothing, perfect digital gradients.
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

**Face-Treatment Flags (choose one):**

- *Print/Reproduction (Warhol-appropriate):* `silkscreen-layered`, `offset-dot`, `halftone-dot`, `four-color-process`, `registration-drift`
- *Other options (for reference):* `engrave-hatch`, `woodblock-carved`, `lithographic-psychological`

**Pose Flags (choose one):**

- *Appropriated Media (Warhol-appropriate):* `appropriated-media-pose`, `frontal-rigid`, `power-stance`
- *Other options (for reference):* `contrapposto`, `candid-motion`, `hieratic-formal`

**Canvas Control Flags (choose one):**

- *Warhol-appropriate:* `strict-reframe`, `format-native`
- *Other options (for reference):* `adaptive-extend`, `source-respect`

**Conceptual Anchor:** Art as commodity. The artist as machine. Everything is on the surface. Mass production as artistic philosophy.

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to declared aspect ratio for 1960s Pop Art presentation. Ignore source dimensions.

Redraw subject in **Andy Warhol 1960s Pop Art silkscreen style** for gallery canvas or print reproduction.

**CRITICAL APPROPRIATION MANDATE:** Subject must be sourced from popular culture, mass media, or consumer products. Do NOT create original poses or compositions. Appropriate the visual language of advertising, publicity photography, or commercial packaging.

**IP Safeguard:** Since authentic Warhol appropriated existing copyrighted imagery, modern recreation must use:

- Fictional celebrities or abstract figures styled as publicity photos
- Original fictional consumer product packaging
- Original cartoon-style characters (not copyrighted properties)
- Generic mechanical objects without brand identifiers

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `silkscreen-layered`
 **Pose Flag:** `appropriated-media-pose`
 **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance:** Warhol's mechanical silkscreen aesthetic supersedes photographic realism. Eliminate artist's hand. Be a machine.

**Mode:** Gallery canvas or print suitable for exhibition.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION (choose one exact specification):**

**PORTRAIT FORMATS:**

- `3:4` (classical portrait)
- `4:5` (Instagram portrait)
- `2:3` (poster/magazine cover)
- `9:16` (social story format)
- `3:10` (vertical scroll)

**LANDSCAPE FORMATS:**

- `4:3` (classical landscape)
- `16:9` (cinematic widescreen)
- `5:3` (panoramic view)
- `10:3` (horizontal scroll)
- `21:9` (ultra-widescreen)
- `2:1` (diptych format for serial repetition)
- `2.35:1` (wide serial format)

**SQUARE FORMATS:**

- `1:1` (most common for iconic single subject - soup cans, celebrity portraits)

**SPECIALTY FORMATS:**

- `2.5:3.5` (playing card)
- `2.75:3.75` (collectible card)
- `8.5:11` (US magazine/letter)
- `11:17` (tabloid magazine)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Strict reframe to maximize subject within declared ratio
- **Spatial Allocation:** Center subject or create grid divisions for serial repetition
- **Background Treatment:** Fill with flat monochrome color field or geometric color blocks
- **Format Justification:** Square for iconic single subject; landscape for serial repetition; portrait for vertical figure emphasis

------

## 3) Artistic Style & Context

**Influences:** Marcel Duchamp's readymades (everyday objects as art), rejection of Abstract Expressionism's emotional mark-making, post-war American consumer culture and mass media saturation.

**Medium/Production Method:**

- Original: Silkscreen ink on acrylic-painted canvas using photographic stencils
- Process: Publicity photo/product image → high-contrast photographic conversion → silkscreen stencil → multiple color layer passes with registration variation
- Studio: Factory assembly-line production with assistants, 1962-1969 era

**Thematic Purpose:** Art as commodity in consumer society; celebrity as manufactured product; mechanical reproduction commentary; elimination of artist's hand; surface over depth philosophy.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Flat color fields** - Large uniform areas with zero gradation or blending
2. **High-contrast photographic source** - Image reduced to stark black shapes and white highlights
3. **Non-naturalistic pop colors** - Bold saturated hues (hot pink, electric blue, vibrant yellow) chosen for graphic impact
4. **Serial repetition with variation** - Same image repeated with different color treatments
5. **Graphic black outlines** - Bold contours created by high-contrast photography

**Period Framing:** 1962-1969 Factory era when Warhol perfected silkscreen technique for mass-producing art.

**Tone Tag:** Cool, detached, impersonal, mechanical, ironic, surface-focused.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Silkscreen printing on canvas with period-appropriate registration imperfections, uneven ink coverage, and mechanical reproduction artifacts.

------

## 4) Technical Execution

### CRITICAL MECHANICAL REPRODUCTION MANDATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

**MANDATORY SILKSCREEN CHARACTERISTICS:** Image must exhibit authentic silkscreen printing process characteristics. Perfect digital smoothness is INAUTHENTIC. The following "flaws" are REQUIRED authentication elements:

- Registration drift between color layers (slight misalignment)
- Uneven ink coverage within color fields (texture variation)
- Visible halftone dot patterns in photographic areas
- Color layer separation creating dimensional effects

**PROHIBITED:** Any evidence of artist's hand - no brushstrokes, no blending, no painterly marks, no emotional expression through technique.

### Silkscreen Process Anchors (≥5 required):

1. **Flat uniform color fields** - Large areas of single color with NO gradation, blending, or tonal variation; each color zone completely uniform as if printed
2. **High-contrast photographic conversion** - Source image reduced to stark black shapes against white highlights with NO mid-tones; photographic detail simplified to graphic shapes
3. **Bold graphic outlines** - Strong black contour lines defining all forms, created by high-contrast photo process, not hand-drawn
4. **Registration imperfections REQUIRED** - Slight misalignment between color layers creating offset effect; colors not perfectly overlapping
5. **Uneven ink coverage texture** - Visible variation in ink density within color fields; some areas show canvas texture through ink, creating authentic mechanical reproduction character

### Color Treatment Anchors:

1. **Non-naturalistic pop palette** - Bold saturated colors chosen for graphic impact, NOT representational accuracy; hot pink skin, yellow hair, electric blue backgrounds, lime green shadows
2. **Limited color per layer** - Each silkscreen pass applies ONE flat color; typical palette 3-5 colors total including black outlines
3. **High saturation primacy** - Colors at maximum intensity; avoid muddy tones, earth tones, or subtle pastels
4. **Monochrome variations optional** - Single-color or grayscale versions for commentary on image fading/reproduction

### Photographic Source Treatment:

1. **Appropriated media image** - Subject derived from existing publicity photo, advertisement, or product packaging; NOT originally composed
2. **Tight cropping** - Billboard-style framing maximizing subject visibility; face/product fills 70-95% of frame
3. **Flattened perspective** - Zero illusionistic depth; complete rejection of atmospheric modeling or Renaissance space

### Serial Repetition Logic (if applicable):

1. **Grid organization** - Multiple repetitions arranged in strict orthogonal layout (2x2, 1x2, etc.)
2. **Color variation across instances** - Each repetition uses different color combination while maintaining identical composition
3. **Mechanical uniformity** - Repeated elements exactly same size and position, emphasizing assembly-line production

### Pose Anchors (if human subject):

1. **Head tilt 0-15 degrees** - Slight angle from appropriated publicity photo; avoid extreme tilts
2. **Shoulder-hip alignment** - Typically frontal or slight rotation; photographed pose, not staged
3. **Weight distribution** - As captured in source photo; no dynamic athletic poses
4. **Gesture economy** - Minimal hand gestures; poses are static publicity shots

### Canvas Adaptation Anchor:

1. **Composition optimized for declared aspect ratio** - Subject scaled and positioned to fill chosen format; serial repetitions divided evenly if grid layout; tight cropping maximizes subject presence within ratio
2. **Canvas substrate visible** - Silkscreen ink allows canvas texture to show through in areas; not opaque like house paint
3. **Layered transparency effects** - Where colors overlap, slight transparency or color mixing visible from printing process
4. **No digital perfection** - Image must feel mechanically printed, not computer-generated; authentic process artifacts throughout

------

## 5) Fashion & Attire – Subject Matter Matrix

### Subject Categories (Choose One):

**CELEBRITY/FIGURE PORTRAITS:**

- **Source Type:** Appropriated publicity photograph or film still aesthetic
- **Pose Convention:** Pre-existing media pose (publicity shot, film still, performance photo); NOT staged by artist
- **Cropping:** Tight framing on face/upper body, billboard-style intimacy
- **Treatment:** Face flattened to graphic shapes, features defined by high-contrast black outlines
- **Wardrobe:** Period-appropriate 1960s styling; costume should read as "from publicity photo"
- **Fabric Behavior:** Flattened to graphic color fields; no realistic drape or texture modeling; simplified to solid color shapes
- **NO real celebrities:** Use fictional figure styled as iconic celebrity

**CONSUMER PRODUCTS:**

- **Source Type:** Commercial packaging or product design
- **Presentation:** Isolated against flat background with no environmental context
- **Typography:** Brand names/logos integral to composition, reproduced from fictional packaging design
- **Scale:** Product monumentalized to fill canvas like billboard
- **Material Physics:** Packaging rendered as flat graphic reproduction; no dimensional product photography lighting
- **Examples:** Soup can, soda bottle, food box, household item
- **NO real brands:** Create original fictional brand with period-appropriate graphic design

**MECHANICAL OBJECTS:**

- **Source Type:** Mass-produced manufactured items
- **Presentation:** Isolated on flat color field, single viewpoint
- **Treatment:** Serialized repetition emphasizing interchangeable nature
- **Surface Treatment:** Metallic or painted surfaces flattened to graphic color fields
- **Examples:** Cars, tools, machinery, currency
- **NO brand logos:** Generic or fictional manufacturer identifiers only

**CARTOON/POP CULTURE ICONS:**

- **Source Type:** Comic or animation character aesthetic
- **Treatment:** Flat graphic rendering with bold outlines
- **Presentation:** Character isolated on color field
- **Line Quality:** Bold black contours defining all forms
- **NO copyrighted characters:** Create original cartoon-style character

### Wardrobe & Styling (If Human Subject):

- **Period:** 1960s styling for authentic Warhol era
- **Approach:** Costume should suggest "publicity photograph" source
- **Detail Level:** Simplified to graphic shapes by high-contrast process; minimal clothing detail
- **Color Treatment:** Non-naturalistic flat colors per silkscreen aesthetic
- **Fabric Physics:** All fabric rendered as flat color fields; no realistic draping, folding, or texture; clothing exists as bold graphic shapes
- **Accessories:** Minimal; only if integral to iconic image

### Accessory Caps:

**Minimalist (0-2 accessories):** Typical for Warhol portraits - jewelry, glasses, or single iconic element only if essential to image recognition

**Props:**

- **Prop Limit:** Maximum 1 hero element if product/object subject
- **Treatment:** Props flattened to graphic shapes, same high-contrast process as main subject
- **Integration:** Props isolated against flat background, no spatial depth
- **Material Rendering:** All materials (metal, glass, fabric, plastic) rendered as flat graphic color fields with bold outlines

### Color Palette (Non-Naturalistic):

**Primary Pop Colors:** Hot pink, electric blue, vibrant yellow, bright red, lime green, orange
 **Avoid:** Realistic skin tones, natural hair colors, earth tones, muddy colors, subtle pastels
 **Background:** Flat monochrome field OR geometric color blocks (never atmospheric or environmental)

### Wardrobe Variation Required:

Change color treatments between iterations if creating serial work; cycle through non-naturalistic pop palette avoiding identical color repetition across multiple versions.

### Coherence Filter:

All costume and styling elements must support 1960s Pop Art appropriation aesthetic; avoid contemporary fashion or styling that would break period authenticity. Fallback = simplified iconic figure in bold single-color outfit against contrasting flat background.

------

## 7) Composition & Background

### Ratio-Specific Composition:

**For Square (1:1):**

- Central subject placement with bilateral symmetry
- Subject occupies 75-90% of canvas
- Iconic presentation like product photography

**For Landscape (Serial Repetition):**

- Grid divisions (2, 3, or 4 panels across)
- Each panel contains identical subject with color variation
- Strict orthogonal organization

**For Portrait (Vertical):**

- Vertical emphasis with tight cropping
- Head/shoulders fill frame
- Minimal negative space

### Style-Specific Composition:

- **Perspective regime:** FLAT - complete rejection of illusionistic depth; no atmospheric perspective, no vanishing points, no spatial recession
- **Grid/symmetry:** Bilateral symmetry for iconic subjects; strict orthogonal grid for serial works
- **Figure:ground ratio:** 70-95% subject dominance; background minimal
- **Density:** Subject fills frame with billboard-scale presence
- **Lighting logic:** Flat frontal lighting eliminating dimensional modeling; high-contrast conversion removes all mid-tones
- **Detail:negative space:** Maximum subject visibility, minimal empty space

### Background Treatment:

**Primary Options:**

- Flat monochrome color field (single solid color behind subject)
- Geometric color blocks (two or more flat color zones creating abstract division)
- **NEVER:** Environmental context, landscape, interior space, atmospheric effects, gradated backgrounds

**Background Colors:** Bold saturated hues contrasting with subject - turquoise, pink, yellow, green, blue, red

### Required Anchors:

**Surface Context Anchor:** Canvas with silkscreen ink application; substrate texture visible through ink

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT ENTIRELY - No frames, borders, or decorative bands outside canvas edge

**Production Context Anchor:** 1960s silkscreen printing on canvas with Factory assembly-line production aesthetic; mechanical reproduction with characteristic registration and ink imperfections

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed for declared aspect ratio with subject scaled to fill format; serial repetitions divided evenly across canvas if grid format

### Spatial Logic:

- **Subject isolation:** Remove all environmental context; subject exists in graphic void
- **Commercial advertising logic:** Frame like product photograph or billboard
- **No narrative:** Eliminate storytelling elements; present icon without context
- **Mechanical organization:** Grid-based serial works show assembly-line regularity

------

## 8) Typography & Text Integration

**Typography Policy:** CONDITIONAL - Only if subject is consumer product with brand identity

### If Product Subject:

**Typography Treatment:**

- **Ratio-Appropriate Zones:** Text positioned within declared aspect ratio following packaging design hierarchy
- **Copy Limits:** ≤6 words per line for brand names; ≤7 total text elements if complex packaging
- **Source:** Appropriated directly from fictional product packaging design
- **Integration:** Typography is integral part of image, not added caption
- **Style:** Reproduce packaging fonts exactly; script logos, sans-serif brand names, etc.
- **Silkscreen Process:** Text subject to same registration drift and ink variation as image
- **Examples:** "Campbell's" script, "TOMATO SOUP" sans-serif, decorative flourishes from label design

**Period-Appropriate Typography:**

- 1960s commercial typography conventions
- Script fonts for brand names (simulate hand-lettered quality)
- Bold sans-serif for product descriptions
- Typography must appear printed, not hand-drawn

**Font Recommendation Format:**

- Closest Google Font: **[Name]** ([Description], [Similarity %])
- Better (if archival): **[Professional Font Family]**
- Example: "Closest Google Font: Lobster (script logo analog, 80%). Better: House Industries Script"

**Production Method Integration:**

- Typography rendered with silkscreen registration imperfections
- Slight ink bleed or misalignment characteristic of 1960s printing
- Text integrated into color layer sequence

### If Celebrity/Figure Subject:

**Typography Policy:** OMIT ALL TEXT

No captions, no names, no dates, no titles. Image speaks entirely through visual icon.

### If Cartoon Character Subject:

**Typography Policy:** OPTIONAL - May include character name if integral to design

Treat text as graphic element with bold simple letterforms following ≤6 words per line limit.

**Format-Specific Text Rules:**

- **Gallery print mode:** Omit text entirely
- **Product subject mode:** Typography essential and integral
- **Serial repetition mode:** Text may appear once or repeat across all panels

------

**END OF FRAMEWORK**

*This framework is constructed from evidence-based visual analysis of 9 authentic Andy Warhol silkscreen works from his 1962-1969 Factory era, representing his definitive Pop Art style. All technical specifications and compositional rules derived from systematic forensic examination of Campbell's Soup Cans (1962), Marilyn Monroe portraits (1962-1967), Elvis (1963), Mercedes-Benz race cars (1986 style but 60s technique), Mickey Mouse (1981 but representative), and commissioned portrait work showing his characteristic silkscreen process.*

# Roy Lichtenstein (Pop Art Period, 1961-1966)

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.

**Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.

**Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette, gesture, and expression through comic book stereotypes.

**Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language.

**Process-Over-Result Priority:** How materials simulate commercial printing supersedes visual appearance.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `halftone-dot-mechanical`

**Pose Flags:** `candid-motion`, `frontal-rigid`, `theatrical-archetype`

**Canvas Control Flags:** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`

**Quantifiers authoritative:** Numeric anchors are targets.

**Text policy:** Optional - follows Section 8 authorization.

**Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures; no copyrighted comic book characters or recognizable superhero iconography.

**Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest; unknown age defaults to adult neutral attire.

**Material authenticity:** No digital photo filters; surface must exhibit authentic mechanical printing simulation with Ben Day dots.

**Period Production Authenticity:** Simulate cheap 1960s comic book printing - newsprint texture, mechanical halftone dots, flat offset color.

**Composition boundaries:** No frames outside canvas; no artificial presentation frames, borders, or credits.

**Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid painterly brushwork, color gradients, atmospheric shading, perspective depth, sensitive line variation.

**Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Redraw in **Roy Lichtenstein's American Pop Art style (1961-1966 classic period)** for **single-panel comic book enlargement**.

Identity via silhouette, gesture, emotional archetype, and comic book stereotyped features.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original character design avoiding copyrighted comic book characters, superhero iconography, recognizable logos, or trademarked costume elements. No existing comic book character names, symbols, or distinctive design elements.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `halftone-dot-mechanical` - skin rendered with uniform red/pink Ben Day dots over white ground creating optical flesh tone.

**Pose Flag:** Selected from `theatrical-archetype` (romance comic emotional poses), `candid-motion` (action sequences), or `frontal-rigid` (confrontational direct address).

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` for dramatic cropping emphasis.

**Style Dominance:** Commercial printing aesthetic dominates over photographic likeness; comic book archetype convention supersedes naturalism.

**Mode Selector:** Single-panel enlargement - extracted comic frame presented as monumental painting.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:**

**PRIMARY FORMATS:**

- `1:1` (square - iconic single subject)
- `4:5` (portrait - close emotional drama)
- `3:4` (classical portrait - figure dominance)
- `5:4` (near-square landscape - two-figure interaction)
- `4:3` (landscape - action/narrative scene)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

**Reframing Method:** Aggressive cropping with figure-to-edge contact - forms press against canvas boundaries to flatten pictorial space and assert two-dimensionality.

**Spatial Allocation:**

- Single figure: occupies 75-85% of canvas area
- Two figures: combined 80-90% of canvas area
- Background: reduced to minimal flat color fields or uniform dot patterns

**Background Treatment:** Radically simplified - solid primary color field, uniform Ben Day dot pattern, or minimal geometric elements. No environmental detail, no atmospheric perspective, no depth cues.

**Format Justification:** Mimics single comic book panel extracted and monumentalized. Ratio chosen enhances emotional impact of frozen narrative moment - portrait for intimacy, landscape for action, square for iconic isolation.

------

## 3) Artistic Style & Context

**Core Influences:**

- 1950s-1960s romance comic books (DC Comics romance titles, Charlton romance comics)
- War comic books (DC war titles, action comics)
- Commercial advertising graphics
- Yellow Pages telephone directory layouts
- Bubble gum wrapper graphics
- Direct reaction against Abstract Expressionism's gestural emotionalism

**Medium/Production Method:** Oil and Magna acrylic on canvas, executed to precisely simulate mechanical offset printing on cheap newsprint. Ben Day dot patterns hand-created using custom stencils, dog-grooming brush, or wire screen frottage to achieve perfectly uniform mechanical appearance. Goal is to eliminate all evidence of artist's hand and replicate industrial reproduction process.

**Thematic Purpose:** Elevation of "low" commercial mass-media imagery to "high" art status through ironic parody of representational linear drawing. Transformation of disposable comic book clichés into monumental cultural icons. "Cool," detached, depersonalized aesthetic replacing subjective emotional expression.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Ben Day Dot System:** Mechanically uniform circular dots in single primary colors creating optical tone mixing. Red/pink dots over white = flesh tones. Blue dots = background atmosphere. Yellow dots = highlights. Dot density controls perceived saturation - no gradation within single dot field.
2. **Heavy Black Enclosure Lines:** Thick, unmodulated black contour lines with characteristic blunt terminals ending in ink "blobs." Lines enclose all forms creating discrete cells. No sensitive line variation, no calligraphic quality - deliberately awkward and depersonalized.
3. **Emotional Archetypes:** Theatrical poses derived from romance comic clichés - crying girls with hand to face, passionate embraces, vulnerable gazes, clenched fists of aggression. Figures frozen in peak emotional moments extracted from narrative context.
4. **Simplified Stylized Anatomy:** Comic book stereotype features - large oval eyes, minimal nose indication, full lips with white highlight, hair rendered as parallel curved line clusters. Anti-naturalistic proportions serve emotional archetype over anatomical accuracy.
5. **Typography Integration (Optional):** Speech bubbles, thought bubbles, sound effect onomatopoeia, caption boxes - fully integrated as graphic compositional elements when present. Hand-lettered uppercase sans-serif mimicking commercial comic lettering.

**Period Framing:** 1961-1966 classic Pop Art period - height of Lichtenstein's comic book appropriation phase. Authentic production era when cheap commercial printing aesthetic was central conceptual strategy.

**Tone Tag:** Cool, detached, ironic, confrontational, anti-sentimental. Mechanical reproduction aesthetic creating emotional distance from subject matter.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Simulate 1960s four-color offset printing process on newsprint - hard-edged flat color registration, visible halftone dot structure, no color bleed, industrial finish eliminating painterly surface.

------

## 4) Technical Execution

**Core Technical Anchors:**

1. **Ben Day Dot Rendering (Primary Surface Treatment):**
   - Dot diameter: 2-3mm equivalent at viewing scale
   - Dot spacing: uniform 4-5mm center-to-center
   - Dot color: single pure primary per area - red/pink for skin, blue for backgrounds/shadows, yellow for highlights/hair
   - Dot density: consistent 50% or 75% coverage per zone - no gradation
   - Dot perfection: mechanically circular, precise spacing, zero hand-drawn irregularity
   - White ground visible: dots always over white, never over other colors
   - Application zones: skin tones universally red/pink dots, backgrounds often blue or yellow dots, hair can be solid or dotted
2. **Line Quality (Enclosure Drawing System):**
   - Line weight: heavy uniform black, 3-5mm equivalent thickness
   - Line character: blunt, unmodulated, deliberately awkward
   - Terminal treatment: emphatic ink blob at line endings - visible 2-3mm circular blot that appears as if pen was lifted while ink pooled
   - Enclosure mandate: every form completely outlined creating discrete closed cells
   - Interior lines: minimal - hair strands (3-7 parallel curves), fabric folds (1-3 lines maximum), facial features (extreme simplification)
   - No sensitive variation: zero calligraphic quality, zero tapering, constant width
   - Edge quality: hard, crisp - simulating printed ink edge
3. **Color System (Absolute Primary Restriction):**
   - Palette: red, yellow, blue, black, white ONLY
   - No mixing: colors applied at full intensity, unmixed, straight from conceptual "can"
   - No gradation: each color zone is flat uniform application
   - No intermediate colors: no orange, green, purple, no desaturated or muted tones
   - Hard edges: all color boundaries are sharp, no feathering
   - Opaque coverage: simulate offset printing ink density
   - Saturation: maximum intensity always
4. **Facial Rendering (Stereotype Convention):**
   - Eyes: large ovals or circles, smaller circular pupils, 3-5 eyelash marks for female figures, minimal detail for male figures
   - Nose: profile = single curved line; frontal = two small marks or omitted entirely; three-quarter = L-shaped mark
   - Mouth: female = full lips with white highlight on lower lip, red fill; male = thin simplified outline; open mouth = simple white tooth shapes
   - Skin: uniform red/pink Ben Day dots over entire face area creating optical flesh tone
   - Expression: wide eyes = drama, closed eyes = distress, narrow eyes = determination; simplified emotional archetypes
5. **Hair Treatment:**
   - Structure: parallel curved line clusters, 3-7 strands per group
   - Color: large solid yellow, blue, or black areas with line overlay
   - Highlights: white negative space creating shine effect
   - Flow: directional lines following hair movement
   - Detail hierarchy: major directional masses, minimal individual strand indication
   - Female vs male: females have flowing dramatic strands, males have simpler shorter treatment
6. **Spatial Flattening (Anti-Illusionism):**
   - Zero atmospheric perspective
   - Zero linear perspective
   - Overlapping planes maintain discrete boundaries
   - No depth cues, no modeling, no chiaroscuro
   - Aggressive cropping presses forms to canvas edge
   - Background = flat color field or uniform dot pattern with no recession
7. **Pose Anchors (Emotional Archetype):**
   - Distress: hand to face, tilted head, wide eyes, tears indicated by small blue lines
   - Passion: embracing figures, tilted heads touching, closed eyes
   - Aggression: clenched fist, squared shoulders, narrow eyes
   - Vulnerability: open palm gestures, direct gaze, parted lips
   - Action: dynamic diagonal body axis, speed lines, foreshortened limbs
   - All poses simplified to essential gesture - no complex articulation
8. **Production Method Anchor (Printing Simulation):**
   - Surface: hard, flat, non-painterly - simulate offset printing on paper
   - Finish: matte, industrial, machine-made appearance
   - Registration: precise color edge alignment mimicking printing press
   - Texture: eliminate all canvas texture, brushstroke evidence, paint facture
   - Goal: painting that appears to BE a printed comic panel, not a painting OF one

**Scale Hierarchy:** Figure elements proportional unless serving emotional emphasis - eyes can be enlarged for vulnerability, hands enlarged for gesture significance. Proportional accuracy secondary to emotional archetype clarity.

**Material Authenticity:** Surface exhibits authentic mechanical printing simulation - perfect dot uniformity, industrial line quality, flat opaque color application with zero painterly characteristics.

**Period Consistency:** All technical elements match 1961-1966 classic Pop period - pre-Brushstroke series, pure comic book appropriation phase.

**Canvas Adaptation:** Composition aggressively reformatted for declared ratio - figures cropped and repositioned to maximize edge contact and flatten space within target format.

## 5) Fashion & Attire - Wardrobe Matrix + Prop Selector

**Wardrobe Tracks:**

**Female Attire (Adult):**

- Simple sleeveless dresses (red, blue, yellow solid colors)
- Blouses with minimal collar detail (1-3 curved lines indicating structure)
- Sweaters with simple neckline indication
- Color: primary colors only - red, blue, yellow; occasionally black or white
- Detail: 1-3 lines maximum per garment indicating seams, necklines, or structure
- Fit: simplified to body contour - no complex drapery
- Accessories: pearl earrings (white circles), minimal jewelry

**Male Attire (Adult):**

- Business suits (blue most common, also black)
- Military uniforms (blue or green with minimal insignia)
- Casual shirts with collars (red, blue, yellow)
- Ties (solid color rectangle with single diagonal line)
- Color: blue dominates male wardrobe; also red, black, white
- Detail: collar lines, lapel indication with 2-3 lines, minimal beyond structure
- No pattern complexity - solid colors only

**Fabric Behavior:**

- No realistic drape or fold complexity
- Garments conform to body as simple color zones
- Folds indicated by 1-3 black lines maximum

- Glass/cup (simple geometric vessel for domestic scenes)

**Color Palette Restrictions:**

- Primary colors ONLY: red, yellow, blue
- Neutrals: black, white
- NO intermediate colors, NO patterns except rare simplified leopard print (black spots on yellow), NO complex decorative elements

**Wardrobe Variation Required:** Cycle through color combinations: red dress with blue background, yellow dress with red background, blue dress with yellow background. Vary garment type: dress, blouse, sweater, suit. Change accessory presence: with earrings, without earrings. Avoid identical color schemes in sequential iterations.

**Props - YAML Pool:**

```yaml
hero_props:
  - telephone_handset_black_coiled_cord
  - coffee_cup_simplified_geometric
  - glass_cylindrical_simple
  - compact_mirror_circular
  - cigarette_simplified_cylinder
  - book_rectangular_minimal
  - letter_white_rectangle

micro_props:
  - pearl_earring_white_circle
  - ring_simplified_band
  - watch_geometric_face
  - pen_simple_cylinder
  - lipstick_tube_red
```

**Total Props:** 1 hero maximum OR 1-2 micro accessories; fallback = clean scene with zero props.

**Coherence Filter:** All elements support 1960s middle-class American consumer culture context as filtered through romance and action comics. If period-inappropriate or culturally incoherent, fallback = simplified attire with no props. NO modern technology, NO contemporary fashion elements, NO anachronistic objects.

## 7) Composition & Background

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

**For Square (1:1):**

- Central subject placement with radial emphasis
- Figure dominance 75-80% of canvas
- Symmetrical or near-symmetrical balance
- Background = simple flat color field or uniform dot pattern
- Iconic isolation emphasis

**For Portrait Ratios (3:4, 4:5):**

- Vertical emphasis with figure extending to top and bottom edges
- Subject dominance 80-85% of canvas
- Aggressive cropping at shoulders or mid-torso
- Background minimal - compressed to thin zones at edges or top
- Hierarchical staging: face > gesture > costume > background

**For Landscape Ratios (4:3, 5:4):**

- Horizontal flow for two-figure interaction or action sequence
- Combined figure dominance 80-90% of canvas
- Panoramic staging: figures side-by-side or overlapping
- Background = horizontal color bands or uniform dot field
- Action emphasis: speed lines, explosion effects, or environmental minimal geometry

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**Perspective Regime:** Strict flattened non-perspectival system. Zero linear perspective, zero atmospheric perspective. All forms exist on frontal picture plane with overlapping but never receding into space.

**Grid/Symmetry:** Centralized organization with heavy forms extending to touch framing edges. Bilateral near-symmetry common for single figures; asymmetrical but balanced for two-figure compositions.

**Figure:Ground Ratio:** 75-90% figure dominance. Background compressed to minimal zones, eliminated entirely, or reduced to flat color/dot pattern fields.

**Density:** High figure density, minimal background density. All visual interest concentrated in subject - background provides contrast, not information.

**Lighting Logic:** No naturalistic lighting. Form defined entirely by black outline and flat color fill. Highlights indicated by white shapes, shadows indicated by dot patterns - both non-directional and non-atmospheric.

**Detail:Negative Space Ratio:** Minimal detail in figures (simplified features, minimal interior lines), maximum negative space in backgrounds. Simplification serves clarity of emotional archetype and graphic impact.

**Composition Optimized for Declared Ratio:**

- Square: central iconic subject
- Portrait: vertical figure emphasis with top-to-bottom edge contact
- Landscape: horizontal action or two-figure interaction
- All ratios: aggressive cropping pressing forms to edges

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:** Canvas simulating printed comic book panel on newsprint - flat, matte, industrial surface with no painterly texture.

**Frame/Band Anchor:** CRITICAL - Absolutely NO black borders, frames, or rectangular outlines around the image. Composition must extend to the physical canvas edge with no buffer zone. Image appears as if comic panel extracted directly from page with no added framing elements. This is a fundamental characteristic of Lichtenstein's work and non-negotiable for authenticity.

**Production Context Anchor:** 1960s four-color offset printing on cheap newsprint - characteristic Ben Day dot patterns, hard-edged color registration, flat opaque inks, mechanical reproduction aesthetic.

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for declared ratio, not adapted from different format. Figure placement, cropping strategy, and background treatment all serve target aspect ratio's dramatic potential.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration

**Binary:** Text OPTIONAL - can omit entirely or include as integrated graphic element.

**If Text Allowed:**

**Ratio-Appropriate Zones:**

- Square (1:1): text confined to upper 20% or lower 15%, never centered
- Portrait (3:4, 4:5): text in upper 25% as thought bubble or speech bubble emerging from top edge
- Landscape (4:3, 5:4): text in left or right 30% zone, or spanning upper 20% as caption box

**Copy Limits:**

- Speech/thought bubbles: maximum 15 words per bubble, ideally 8-12 words
- Caption boxes: maximum 20 words, broken into 2-3 lines
- Sound effects: single word, maximum 6 letters (e.g., WHAAM!, POW!, VICKI!)
- Dialogue punctuation: periods, exclamation points, question marks only - no ellipses or complex punctuation

**Period-Appropriate Typography:**

- Hand-lettered uppercase sans-serif mimicking 1960s comic book lettering
- Bold uniform stroke weight
- Generous letter spacing for high legibility
- Left-aligned in speech/thought bubbles
- Centered in caption boxes
- Italic for emphasis or interior monologue

**Font Recommendation:** Closest Google Font: **Anton** (bold compressed sans-serif, 70% match to comic lettering conventions) Better professional match: **Comicraft fonts** (professional comic lettering), **Blambot fonts** (authentic comic typography), or hand-lettered uppercase sans-serif with slight irregularity suggesting manual creation.

**Text Integration Elements:**

**Speech Bubbles:**

- Organic cloud-like outline with pointed tail directing to speaker
- White fill with black outline (2-3mm thick line)
- Text in bold black uppercase
- Bubble integrated as compositional element - can touch canvas edge
- Tail placement indicates speaker clearly

**Thought Bubbles:**

- Cloud-like form connected to thinker by chain of small circles (descending size)
- Same treatment as speech bubbles but with bubble-chain connector
- Indicates interior monologue

**Caption Boxes:**

- Rectangular yellow box with black outline
- Black italic text on yellow ground
- Typically upper left or upper right corner
- Contains narrative text setting scene or providing context

**Sound Effects (Onomatopoeia):**

- Large stylized letters as graphic element
- Yellow or red with black outline, or white with black outline
- Scale competes with figures for visual dominance
- Integrated into action/explosion imagery
- Examples: WHAAM!, POW!, BLAM!, VROOM!

**Format-Specific Text Rules:**

**Single Portrait Print Mode (No Masthead):**

- Text optional but if included, must be speech bubble, thought bubble, or sound effect integrated INTO image
- NO caption boxes, NO title text, NO credits
- Text serves dramatic emphasis, not publication function

**Period Accuracy:** All typography must match 1960s comic book lettering conventions - hand-lettered quality, bold sans-serif, high-contrast black on white (or black on yellow for captions).

**Historical Accuracy:** Text content, if present, should reflect 1960s dialogue patterns - period-appropriate language, emotional directness, melodramatic phrasing typical of romance or action comics.
