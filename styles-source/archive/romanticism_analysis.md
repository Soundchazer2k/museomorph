## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **5:4 ratio** (landscape) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

**RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **5:4**. This is a hard requirement.

Analyze the provided portrait. Redraw the subject entirely from scratch in Eugène Delacroix's French Romantic style (1822-1863).

- Preserve likeness through **passionate gesture, atmospheric color integration, psychological intensity**
- **Timeframe:** Peak French Romanticism, Salon exhibition period (1822-1863)
- **Degree of likeness:** Emotionally penetrating while maintaining dramatic grandeur; emphasis on inner passion over photographic accuracy
- **Emotional tone:** Passionate intensity, Romantic yearning, dramatic turmoil, psychological depth, Byronic heroism
- **Pose conventions:** Dynamic instability with 15-30° shoulder-hip differential; dramatic arm extension; asymmetrical weight distribution suggesting motion or emotional tension
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original French Romantic costume and setting avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `impasto-sculptural` + `glazing-layers-buildup`
- **Pose Flag:** `psychological-tension`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Delacroix's revolutionary color primacy and expressive brushwork overrides any source characterization - passion expressed clearly through paint
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery (French Salon standard with Romantic emotional intensity)
- **Final Ratio Confirmation:** Output must be exactly **5:4 ratio**, no exceptions

The final result must embody Romantic passion through chromatic intensity and dynamic brushwork while maintaining museum-grade technical authenticity.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `5:4` (landscape - natively supported by NanoBanana: 1152×896)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Ratio Status:** Native (5:4 supported directly)
- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely - extend atmospheric backgrounds with Romantic drama
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned for dynamic instability - off-center, diagonal emphasis, emotional forward momentum
- **Background Treatment:** Extend smoky atmospheric effects, stormy landscapes, or exotic architectural elements with dissolved edges merging into color-saturated atmosphere
- **Format Justification:** 5:4 landscape ratio serves Delacroix's major Salon works tradition, allowing dramatic horizontal sweep while maintaining figure prominence - optimal for single-figure Romantic portraiture with atmospheric context

------

## 3) Artistic Style & Context

**Influences:** Peter Paul Rubens (rich palette, dynamic composition, expressive color), Venetian Renaissance (Veronese, Titian - color primacy over line), Théodore Géricault (raw power, dramatic intensity), John Constable (color sparkle, flossing technique), Michel Eugène Chevreul (scientific complementary color theory), Lord Byron (sublime passion, tragic heroism), literary sources (Shakespeare, Goethe, Dante)

**Medium/Production method:** Oil on industrially prepared 19th-century canvas with revolutionary ground technique: initial distemper (water-based glue paint) lay-in covered with thin oil glazes creating signature matt-but-bright surface. Paint application: visible expressive brushstrokes, flossing (2-5mm delicate color strokes for sparkle), thin color cross-hatching in shadows, flochetage (division of touches), thick impasto (3-5mm) in highlights. Surface goal: non-glossy luminosity like pastel or watercolor.

**Thematic purpose:** French Romantic opposition to Neoclassical restraint - prioritizing emotional expression, passionate movement, chromatic intensity, and subjective vision over academic polish. Creating bridge between artist's interior world and beholder through scientifically informed yet feverishly imaginative painting.

**Hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**

- **Chevreul Complementary System:** 60-70% of figure rendering uses complementary shadows (yellow skin = violet shadows; red fabric = green shadows) achieving unprecedented chromatic intensity
- **Atmospheric Integration:** 70% backgrounds employ smoky blue-gray, brown-gray, or storm green-gray atmospheric effects; 30% saturated dramatic accents (crimson, emerald, golden ochre)
- **Dynamic Contrapposto:** 15-30° shoulder-hip angle differential creating passionate instability; 10-25° head tilt for psychological engagement; asymmetrical weight distribution
- **Expressive Surface Texture:** Visible brushwork with 2-5mm flossing strokes, 3-5mm impasto highlights, thin cross-hatched color shadows, flochetage creating vibrating paint surface
- **Soft Atmospheric Edges:** Figures dissolve into backgrounds through broken edges and color temperature shifts - rejecting hard neoclassical contours

**Period framing:** French Romanticism (1822-1863), opposition to Ingres's neoclassical linearity, Salon exhibition culture, post-North Africa journey (1832) exotic influence, scientific color theory application

**Tone Tag:** Passionate intensity, Romantic yearning, chromatic vibrancy, psychological penetration, dramatic turmoil, Byronic heroism

**Production Era Authenticity:** 1822-1863 French academic canvas preparation with distemper ground innovation, Chevreul color theory application, atmospheric painting techniques opposing neoclassical polish

------

## 4) Technical Execution

**Line Work - EXPLICIT TEXTURE REQUIREMENTS:** Paint surface MUST show individual brushstroke marks with distinct directional flow. Each stroke 2-5mm width, applied in clusters of 5-15 strokes per square inch in highlight areas. Stroke direction follows form curvature - vertical on arms, horizontal on shoulders, diagonal following fabric drape. Edges MUST be broken and irregular, not smooth gradients. Background atmospheric areas require loose, visible brushwork with 10-20mm wide sweeping strokes creating smoky texture. Canvas weave texture MUST be visible through thin paint areas. NO airbrush smoothness. NO digital gradient tools. Every surface area shows evidence of brush contact with varied pressure creating thick-to-thin paint deposits.

**Anatomical Stylization:** Academic 1:7.5 head-to-body ratio maintained; musculature emphasized through écorché study showing tension beneath surface; minimal exaggeration - realism prioritized over idealization; figures captured in powerful expressive motion with dynamic asymmetrical poses.

**Detail Hierarchy:** Strategic detail suppression preserving "larger effect" and "first pure expression" of imaginative vision; excessive detail avoided as it would "obscure the idea"; focus concentrated on emotionally critical areas (hands, face, dramatic gesture) while backgrounds dissolve atmospherically.

**Coloring Method - MANDATORY COMPLEMENTARY SHADOW SYSTEM:** CRITICAL: Shadows MUST use complementary colors, NEVER darkened local color. Specific requirements:

- Yellow/ochre skin: shadows rendered in violet (#8B7AB8) and blue-gray (#6B7B8C), NOT brown
- Red fabric: shadows rendered in blue-green (#2D5A5A) and teal (#1A4D4D), NOT dark red
- White fabric: shadows rendered in cool blue (#A4B8C4) and violet-gray (#9B8FA8), NOT gray
- Blue fabric: shadows rendered in orange-brown (#8B5A3C) and warm ochre (#A67C52), NOT dark blue
- Green fabric: shadows rendered in red-violet (#8B4A6B) and warm pink (#B85A7A), NOT dark green

Flesh tone construction: Base warm ochre (#C9A876) + rose undertone (#D4A5A5) + violet shadow (#8B7AB8) + blue-gray deep shadow (#6B7B8C). Apply shadows as distinct color strokes, not blended smoothness. Light areas receive thick paint, shadow areas receive thin transparent paint showing canvas texture underneath.

Background atmospheric color: 70% stormy blue-gray (#5A6C7D), smoky brown-gray (#6B5D52), green-gray (#5A6B5D); 30% saturated accents crimson (#8B2635), emerald (#2D5A4A), golden ochre (#B8914D).

**Texture Specifications - MEASURABLE PAINT PHYSICS:**

IMPASTO HIGHLIGHTS (required in 15-25% of painted surface):

- White fabric highlights: 3-5mm thick paint ridges casting micro-shadows
- Metal jewelry: 2-3mm thick paint creating dimensional shine spots
- Flesh tone cheekbones: 2mm thick warm ochre creating sculptural buildup
- Fabric fold peaks: 3mm thick paint following fold direction Apply impasto using palette knife drag marks (1-2mm wide parallel ridges) or thick brush deposit (single stroke 5-8mm wide showing brush hair separations)

FLOSSING TECHNIQUE (required in light-transition areas): Small delicate color strokes 2-5mm length, applied in clusters of 3-7 strokes creating sparkle effect. Specifically apply:

- Hair highlights: 3mm golden strokes overlapping darker base
- Fabric sheen: 4mm perpendicular strokes catching light
- Metal reflections: 2mm bright strokes at angles
- Atmospheric light: 5mm delicate touches in background Each flossing stroke MUST remain visible as individual mark, not blended

FLOCHETAGE (required throughout): Division of touches creating vibrating surface - apply paint as distinct dabs 3-8mm diameter, leaving tiny gaps (0.5-1mm) between adjacent color areas. Surface should show mosaic-like structure of individual color touches rather than smooth blending. Background clouds: 10-15mm loose touches. Fabric mid-tones: 4-6mm touches. Flesh mid-tones: 3-4mm touches blending at edges only.

CROSS-HATCHING SHADOWS (required in all shadow areas): Thin transparent strokes 1-2mm width, applied in 2-3 directional layers creating woven texture:

- First layer: violet shadow strokes diagonal 45°
- Second layer: blue-gray shadow strokes diagonal -45°
- Third layer (deep shadows only): darker complement strokes vertical Strokes MUST remain visible as linear marks, showing canvas texture between strokes

EDGE TREATMENT (required at all figure-background transitions): Broken irregular edges with 3-8mm soft transition zone. NO hard cutout edges. Paint figure edges using loose strokes that fade into background through: reduced paint thickness (thick to thin over 5mm distance), color temperature shift (warm figure to cool background over 8mm distance), stroke direction change (figure strokes perpendicular to edge, background strokes parallel to edge). Edges MUST show individual brush marks, not airbrushed blur.

CANVAS WEAVE VISIBILITY (required in thin paint areas): Canvas texture MUST be visible in: shadow areas (paint 0.5-1mm thin), background atmosphere (paint 1-2mm thin), transition zones (paint 1mm thin). Texture creates subtle grid pattern 1-2 threads per mm. NO flat digital surface smoothness.

SURFACE FINISH - MATT-BRIGHT EFFECT: Overall surface MUST appear non-glossy with irregular light reflection creating soft sheen, not mirror shine. Achieve through: thick impasto creating texture, thin glaze areas showing canvas, varied paint thickness creating uneven surface (height variation 0-5mm across painting). Surface reflects light diffusely like chalk or egg tempera, not like plastic or enamel.

**Pose Anchors:** Head positioning: 10-25° tilt creating psychological engagement and emotional intensity; Shoulder-hip differential: 15-30° contrapposto creating dynamic instability; Weight distribution: asymmetrical - figures rarely stable or centered, suggesting motion or passion; Gesture economy: dramatic arm extension (reaching, grasping, defensive) with 2-3 meaningful positions maximum emphasizing emotional state.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Proportions based on academic écorché study - realistic musculature with emphasized tension beneath surface; no stylistic elongation or distortion; natural human scale with passionate gestural amplification.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Paint surface texture with measurable three-dimensional relief: impasto 3-5mm peaks, thin areas 0.5-1mm showing canvas, flossing 2-5mm individual strokes, flochetage 3-8mm distinct touches, cross-hatch 1-2mm linear texture. Surface roughness creates light diffusion, not smooth reflection. Every square inch shows brush contact evidence.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All elements historically accurate to French Romantic period (1822-1863) with documented Chevreul color theory application, post-1832 North African influence, and anti-neoclassical technical methods.

**Production Method Anchor:** Visible brushwork texture throughout: thick impasto ridges in highlights, thin transparent glazes in shadows showing canvas weave, broken edges with individual stroke marks, mosaic-like flochetage surface structure, cross-hatched shadow texture, flossing sparkle strokes in transitions. Paint behaves as physical medium with dimensional buildup, not digital flat surface.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 5:4 landscape format with horizontal dramatic sweep while maintaining figure prominence at 70-75% canvas area.

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Photo-to-Painting Integration Mandate:** Modern photographic subject must be transformed into Goya's oil painting aesthetic through:
  - Painterly edge treatment replacing photographic sharpness
  - Chiaroscuro lighting regime replacing photographic lighting
  - Period-appropriate wardrobe and props
  - Oil paint surface characteristics (visible brushwork, impasto highlights, canvas texture in shadows)
  - Atmospheric integration matching Goya's spatial logic
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement Protocol:** Aspect ratio control is prompt-based only. Combat ratio resistance through:
  - Explicit ratio declaration in multiple prompt locations
  - Repetitive ratio reinforcement using different phrasings
  - Negative constraints explicitly prohibiting unwanted ratios
  - Compositional anchors designed specifically for target ratio
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-chiaroscuro-romantic` (Goya-specific custom flag)
  - Smooth blending in flesh tones with fine detail in features
  - Dramatic single-source lighting with sharp light-to-shadow transitions
  - Psychological expressiveness through subtle facial modeling
  - Naturalistic proportions (no elongation or caricature)
- **Pose Flags:** `contrapposto` (portraits), `psychological-tension` (war scenes), `candid-motion` (group compositions)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` (primary), `adaptive-extend` (atmospheric portraits only)
- **Style Dominance:** Goya's Transitional Romantic Period (1793-1814) oil painting aesthetic dominates; photographic subject transformed into painted figure maintaining period authenticity.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language:
  - Impasto thickness: 2-4mm in peak highlights
  - Light-to-dark ratios: 25-45% illuminated (varies by genre)
  - Head-to-body ratio: 1:7.5 to 1:8 (naturalistic)
  - Contrapposto angle: 10-15° hip-shoulder differential
- **Material Authenticity:** Oil on canvas with authentic period techniques:
  - Alla prima (wet-on-wet) application
  - Thin glazes in shadows, thick impasto in highlights
  - Visible brushwork and canvas texture
  - No digital filters or modern post-processing
- **Safety Guardrails:**
  - No nudity - all figures fully clothed with period-appropriate modesty
  - War violence acceptable but non-graphic (no explicit wounds, gore, or graphic injury)
  - Distress conveyed through pose, expression, and dramatic lighting rather than graphic detail
- **Failure Mode Prevention:** Avoid:
  - Photographic lighting (HDR, modern photography look)
  - Digital smoothness (Instagram filters, beauty retouching)
  - Rococo lightness (pastels, decorative prettiness)
  - Black Paintings extremism (grotesque distortion, total despair)
  - Generic "old master" defaults (need Goya-specific characteristics)

### 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**RATIO SELECTION BY GENRE:**

**War/Dramatic Scenes:**

- Primary: `4:3` (landscape - theatrical staging)
- Alternative: `16:9` (wide landscape - panoramic action)
- Justification: Horizontal format accommodates multiple figures, architectural backdrop, theatrical shallow space

**Tenebrism Portraits:**

- Primary: `3:4` (portrait - vertical emphasis)
- Alternative: `2:3` (portrait - taller format)
- Justification: Vertical format emphasizes isolated figure emerging from void darkness

**Atmospheric Portraits:**

- Primary: `3:4` (portrait - balanced figure-ground)
- Alternative: `2:3` (portrait - environmental context)
- Justification: Portrait format with room for landscape background

**Group Compositions:**

- Primary: `5:4` (near-square landscape - frieze arrangement)
- Alternative: `4:3` (landscape - horizontal rhythm)
- Justification: Wide format accommodates multiple figures in horizontal arrangement

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Ratio Status:** [Native NanoBanana ratio selected]
- **Photo-to-Painting Integration:** Subject extracted from modern photographic context and recomposed into Goya's spatial logic and period environment
- **Reframing Method:** Strict reframe - subject repositioned according to Goya's compositional principles, period-appropriate background constructed
- **Spatial Allocation:** [Genre-specific placement following Goya's patterns]
- **Background Treatment:** [Genre-specific - void darkness / atmospheric landscape / theatrical architecture / interior space]
- **Format Justification:** Ratio serves Goya's [genre] compositional strategy from 1793-1814 period

### 2.1) Ratio Compliance & Renderer Adaptation

**NOT APPLICABLE** - All genre-appropriate ratios are natively supported by NanoBanana renderer. No adaptation required.

------

### 3) Artistic Style & Context

**Primary Influences:**

- Diego Velázquez (complex realism, psychological portraiture)
- Rembrandt van Rijn (dramatic chiaroscuro, etching mastery, tenebrism)
- Direct observation of Spanish society and Napoleonic War trauma

**Medium & Production Method:**

- Oil paint on canvas
- Alla prima (wet-on-wet) technique with limited earth-tone palette
- Thin transparent glazes in shadows (bone black + earth tones)
- Heavy impasto in highlights (pure white lead, 2-4mm thickness)
- Visible directional brushwork following form
- Canvas texture sometimes visible through thin shadow passages
- Mixed on palette, applied directly (no optical color mixing)

**Thematic Purpose:** Psychological intensity, social critique, unflinching documentation of human suffering and folly, dramatic tension between light and darkness as metaphor for reason versus superstition, dignity in portraiture regardless of social class.

**Hallmark Motifs (Quantified):**

1. **Extreme Chiaroscuro/Tenebrism**
   - Light-to-dark ratio: 25-45% illuminated / 55-75% shadow (varies by genre)
   - Single dramatic light source (lantern, dawn light, directional daylight, candlelight)
   - Peak highlights: Pure white lead impasto adjacent to near-black voids
   - No gradual transition zones - sharp cutoff from light to shadow
   - Shadow depth: Transparent glazes retaining minimal detail or total void
2. **Psychological Expressiveness**
   - Direct eye contact engaging viewer (portraits)
   - Subtle facial modeling conveying inner state
   - Naturalistic proportions (1:7.5 to 1:8 head-to-body ratio)
   - Minimal head tilt (2-8° toward viewer)
   - Hands prominently lit and expressively positioned
   - Contrapposto stance (10-15° hip-shoulder angle) creating subtle dynamism
3. **Dramatic Spatial Compression**
   - Flattened theatrical space (war scenes)
   - Void backgrounds (tenebrism portraits - 50%+ pure black)
   - Atmospheric perspective (landscape portraits - tonal recession)
   - Shallow picture depth (2-3 figure depths maximum)
   - Foreground emphasis (70-90% of visual weight on figures)
   - Background abstraction (minimal detail, suggestive rather than descriptive)
4. **Period-Accurate Spanish Fashion (1793-1814)**
   - Empire/Regency silhouette (feminine, high-waisted, modest)
   - Napoleonic military uniforms (masculine military)
   - Late 18th-century Spanish civilian dress (tail coats, breeches, mantillas)
   - Maja style (Spanish middle class - fitted bodice, full skirt)
   - All wardrobe fully covering with period-appropriate modesty
5. **Restricted Earth-Tone Palette**
   - Foundation: Bone black, warm dark browns (#1a1612, #3d3226)
   - Mid-tones: Earth ochres, umbers (#8b7355, #8b7968)
   - Highlights: White lead, warm flesh tones (#e8d4b8, #dbb896, #f5f0e6)
   - Accents: Vermillion red, Prussian blue, gold ochre (≤15% of canvas)
   - Atmospheric greys: Blue-grey, warm grey (#4a5259, #6b5e4f)

**Period Framing:** Transitional Romantic Period, post-1793 deafness, encompassing Napoleonic Wars (1808-1814), characterized by psychological depth, social commentary, dramatic chiaroscuro, movement away from court painter Rococo toward critical modernity, bridge between Old Masters and modern art.

**Tone Tag:** Psychologically intense, dramatically lit, socially observant, dignified, unflinching, emotionally charged, atmospheric, period-authentic Spanish character.

### 4) Technical Execution (≥5 Anchors + Measurement Specifications)

**EXPLICIT TEXTURE REQUIREMENTS - MANDATORY VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS:**

Paint surface MUST show individual brushstroke marks with distinct directional flow throughout the entire composition. NO smooth digital surfaces. NO airbrush gradients. NO blended perfection. Every area of the painting must provide visible evidence of physical brush contact with canvas.

**BRUSH APPLICATION SPECIFICATIONS:**

- **Stroke Width:** Individual visible strokes 3-8mm width in major areas, 1-3mm in detail areas
- **Stroke Density:** 8-15 distinct visible strokes per square inch in painted areas
- **Directional Flow:** Strokes follow form curvature - vertical on vertical surfaces, horizontal on horizontal planes, diagonal following fabric drape, radial around curved forms
- **Stroke Visibility:** Each brushstroke must remain distinguishable as individual mark, not melted into smooth blend
- **Application Method:** Dragged brush creates directional texture with visible start and end points, pressure variation creates thick-to-thin paint deposits within single stroke

**1. Oil Paint Application Anchor - MEASURABLE PAINT PHYSICS:**

**IMPASTO HIGHLIGHTS (REQUIRED - 15-20% of painted surface):**

- **White lead highlights:** 2-4mm thick paint ridges casting actual micro-shadows, applied with loaded brush in single directional stroke
- **Peak illumination points:** 3mm dimensional buildup on facial high points (forehead, nose bridge, cheekbones), white fabric folds, architectural light catches
- **Application texture:** Palette knife drag marks creating 1-2mm parallel ridges OR thick brush deposit showing individual brush hair separations (0.5mm furrows within stroke)
- **Physical relief:** Paint thickness creates measurable three-dimensional surface with height variation of 0-4mm across painting
- **Specific locations:** Facial highlights (forehead, nose, cheekbones, chin), hands (knuckles, fingertips), white clothing (shoulder tops, sleeve folds, collar edges), props catching light

**SHADOW GLAZES (REQUIRED - all shadow areas):**

- **Thickness:** Thin transparent layers 0.5-1mm allowing canvas weave texture to remain visible
- **Canvas visibility:** Woven canvas texture (1-2 threads per mm grid pattern) MUST show through shadow paint
- **Application method:** Thinned paint dragged across canvas with light pressure, not fully opaque coverage
- **Transparency test:** Canvas preparation tone must be visible through shadow glaze layers
- **Specific locations:** All areas in shadow - background voids, clothing folds in darkness, facial shadow sides, architectural elements in shade

**ALLA PRIMA WET-ON-WET METHOD:**

- Colors mixed on palette to target value/hue before application
- Single-session direct painting approach, NOT layered glazing buildup
- Adjacent wet paint areas can blend at contact edges but retain individual stroke identity
- Brush loaded with paint deposits full color in single stroke, not built up through multiple passes

**BRUSH ECONOMY WITH DIRECTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:**

- Maximum expressive effect with minimum strokes
- Each stroke purposeful and visible
- Stroke direction follows anatomical/fabric form:
  - **Flesh:** Curved strokes following muscle structure, radial around rounded forms
  - **Fabric:** Diagonal strokes following drape direction, perpendicular strokes at fold changes
  - **Hair:** Flowing directional strokes following hair fall, 5-12mm length
  - **Architecture:** Horizontal/vertical strokes following building planes
  - **Atmospheric background:** Loose gestural strokes 10-20mm length creating smoky texture

**EDGE TREATMENT (REQUIRED at all transitions):**

- **War scenes/Tenebrism:** Sharp light-to-shadow transitions with minimal blend zone (1-3mm)
- **Atmospheric portraits:** Softer transitions with broken edges (3-6mm blend zone)
- **Figure-to-background:** Dissolved edges where figure merges into atmosphere through reduced paint opacity and stroke direction changes
- **NO hard cutout edges:** All boundaries must show painterly brush marks, not vector-crisp contours
- **Edge texture:** Visible individual brush strokes at edges, not smooth gradients

**2. Chiaroscuro Lighting Anchor (GENRE-SPECIFIC):**

**War/Dramatic Scenes:**

- Single dramatic light source (lantern, dawn, dusk)
- 30% illuminated / 70% shadow ratio
- Concentrated white lead highlights (5-10% of canvas)
- Near-black void shadows, no detail retention
- Lightest whites directly adjacent to darkest blacks

**Tenebrism Portraits:**

- Single directional light from upper left
- 25% illuminated / 75% void background
- Face and hands receive maximum luminosity
- Background = absolute black void, no spatial definition
- Subtle gradations on flesh, sharp cutoff to darkness

**Atmospheric Portraits:**

- Diffused natural daylight, overcast quality
- 45% illuminated / 55% atmospheric shadow
- Softer, more graduated transitions
- Translucent shadows retaining form definition
- Three distinct value zones: highlight, mid-tone, shadow

**Group Compositions:**

- Multiple artificial light sources (candles, interior lamps)
- 40% illuminated / 60% shadow
- Distributed focal points across figures
- Warm ochre candlelight vs. cool shadow blues

**3. Brushwork & Surface Texture Anchor:**

- **Flesh Tones:** Smooth blending with fine detail in facial features, visible directional strokes in larger areas
- **Fabric Rendering:** Heavy impasto in white garments, thin glazes in dark clothing, rapid calligraphic strokes for lace/pattern
- **Hair:** Fluid directional strokes following form, minimal blending, economical marks
- **Backgrounds:** Thin uniform washes (void type), loose painterly suggestion (atmospheric type), gestural abstraction (architectural type)
- **Canvas Texture Visibility:** Apparent in thin shadow passages, obscured in thick highlights

**4. Color Mixing & Palette Anchor - GOYA'S EARTH-TONE SYSTEM WITH HEX SPECIFICATIONS:**

**FLESH TONE CONSTRUCTION (MANDATORY FORMULA):**

- **Base layer:** Warm ochre (#c9a876) + white lead (#f5f0e6) mixed to desired value
- **Rose undertone:** Add minimal vermillion (#c84530) or rose madder (#d4a5a5) for living warmth (5-10% of mixture)

### 7) Composition & Background

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

**For War/Dramatic Scenes (4:3 or 16:9 Landscape):**

- Horizontal flow emphasizing theatrical staging
- Low horizon line (lower 1/3 of canvas)
- Figures occupy 70-80% of picture plane depth
- Architectural backdrop flattened to decorative element
- Diagonal tension lines (30-45°) vs. vertical barriers
- Figure dominance ≥70% of visual weight
- Negative space used dramatically (darkness = threat)
- Shallow theatrical platform spatial logic

**For Tenebrism Portraits (3:4 or 2:3 Portrait):**

- Vertical emphasis with figure emerging from darkness
- No background spatial markers - pure void
- Figure placement slightly off-center for tension
- 25% illuminated / 75% void background ratio
- Figure dominance 85-90% of visual interest
- Subject floats in undefined black space
- Focal point: Face at upper 1/3 intersection
- Strong vertical axis with subtle S-curve (contrapposto)

**For Atmospheric Portraits (3:4 or 2:3 Portrait):**

- Vertical emphasis with landscape background
- Horizon at middle to upper-middle of canvas
- Figure in front of (not within) landscape
- 45% illuminated / 55% atmospheric shadow
- Figure dominance 60-70% of visual weight
- Landscape elements suggested through tonal recession
- Color temperature shift (warm to cool) creating depth
- Figure anchored to ground plane

**For Group Compositions (5:4 or 4:3 Landscape):**

- Horizontal frieze-like arrangement
- Shallow interior perspective (2-3 figure depths)
- Eye-level to slightly elevated viewpoint
- 40% illuminated / 60% shadow
- Figure dominance 80% of canvas
- Multiple distributed focal points
- Alternating light/dark figures creating rhythm
- Furniture/architecture defines interior space

**STYLE-SPECIFIC FRAMING REGIME:**

**Perspective System:**

- **War Scenes:** Flattened/compressed theatrical space, psychological rather than geometric logic
- **Tenebrism Portraits:** No perspective - void space, timeless isolation
- **Atmospheric Portraits:** Atmospheric perspective with minimal linear perspective, figure-ground separation
- **Group Compositions:** Shallow interior perspective, horizontal organization

**Figure:Ground Relationship:**

- Detail follows psychological/narrative importance, not spatial logic
- Foreground sharp, background dissolved
- Maximum detail in faces and hands (10-15% of canvas)
- Moderate detail in primary garments and props (25-35%)
- Minimal detail in backgrounds and periphery (50-65%)

**Lighting Logic:**

- Single dramatic light source (lantern, dawn, directional daylight, candlelight)
- Extreme value contrast (lightest whites adjacent to darkest blacks)
- Shadows: transparent or void (no reflected light fill)
- Highlights: concentrated white lead applications
- Illogical symbolic lighting (not natural source within scene)

**Required Anchors:**

**Surface Context Anchor:** Oil on canvas with visible texture - canvas weave apparent in thin shadow passages, obscured in thick impasto highlights. Period-appropriate linen canvas preparation.

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT ENTIRELY - no decorative frames, no borders, no external presentation elements. Composition extends to canvas edges following Goya's practice.

**Production Context Anchor:** Oil painting created 1793-1814 in Spain. Direct painting method (alla prima), limited earth-tone palette, dramatic single-source lighting, psychological intensity, social commentary, period authenticity in all elements.

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for [SELECTED RATIO] following Goya's spatial logic for that format type. Subject recomposed from photographic origin into period-appropriate painted environment.

------

### 8) Typography & Text Integration

**Binary:** OMIT

Francisco Goya's Transitional Romantic Period paintings (1793-1814) contained no text, titles, or typography within the painted image. All text (when present) appeared as separate inscriptions or in accompanying print series captions, never integrated into the oil painting itself.

For photographic subject integration maintaining period authenticity, no text should appear within the painted composition.

**Timeframe:** British Regency Romanticism, Royal Academy dominance (1790s-1830)

**Historical Context:** Thomas Lawrence was the leading British portrait painter of the Regency era, succeeding Sir Joshua Reynolds as Principal Painter to King George III. His style combined theatrical drama with virtuoso technique, elegant idealization with psychological penetration, and finished precision with atmospheric spontaneity - creating the definitive aesthetic of British Romantic portraiture.

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio
- **Photo-to-Painting Integration Mandate:** Modern photographic subject must be transformed into Lawrence's bravura oil painting aesthetic through:
  - Face rendered with smooth luminous finish (95% completion)
  - Hair dissolved into atmospheric brushwork (70% completion)
  - Fabrics showing selective finish with broken edges (60-70% completion)
  - Backgrounds loosely gestural, atmospheric (30% completion)
  - Controlled looseness hierarchy radiating from face outward
- **NanoBanana Ratio Enforcement Protocol:** Combat ratio resistance through explicit multi-location declarations, repetitive reinforcement, negative constraints
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `glazing-layers-buildup` + `luminous-transparent` (Lawrence-specific custom flag)
  - Smooth blended finish in face only
  - Thin transparent glazes building luminosity
  - Warm flesh tones with porcelain highlights
  - Invisible brushwork in facial features
- **Pose Flags:** `elegant-contrapposto` (15-25° theatrical S-curve), `romantic-gesture` (expressive hand positions)
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Lawrence's Regency bravura technique dominates; photographic subject transformed into elegant theatrical portrait with controlled looseness hierarchy
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications override descriptive language:
  - Face brushwork: 1-2mm fine detail, invisible strokes
  - Hair brushwork: 5-12mm sweeping visible strokes
  - Fabric highlights: 2-3mm impasto thickness
  - Background strokes: 15-25mm loose gestural marks
  - Controlled looseness: Face 95% finished, backgrounds 30% finished
- **Material Authenticity:** Oil on canvas with authentic Regency techniques:
  - Thin glazes for luminous flesh (0.3-0.8mm)
  - Selective impasto in fabric highlights (2-3mm)
  - Atmospheric dissolution through broken edges
  - Bravura brushwork demonstrating technical mastery
- **Safety Guardrails:**
  - No nudity - all figures fully clothed with Regency-appropriate modesty
  - Empire waist gowns with high necklines, long sleeves
  - Regency tailcoats, high-collared shirts, cravats for masculine subjects
- **Failure Mode Prevention:** Avoid:
  - Uniform finish across entire canvas (violates controlled looseness)
  - Heavy opaque flesh tones (must be transparent and luminous)
  - Literal photographic detail in backgrounds (must be atmospheric)
  - Digital smoothness everywhere (face smooth, everything else textured)
  - Hard edges throughout (edges must dissolve proportionally from face)

## Framework Sections

### 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[SELECT RATIO]** - ignore source photograph dimensions completely.

**RATIO ENFORCEMENT (NanoBanana):** Generate image with EXACT aspect ratio of **[SELECT RATIO]**. This is a hard requirement.

Transform modern photographic subject into **Thomas Lawrence's British Regency portrait aesthetic (1790s-1830)**, maintaining the subject's identity through elegant idealization while fully converting photographic characteristics into Lawrence's theatrical bravura painting language.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `glazing-layers-buildup` + `luminous-transparent` - Smooth blended finish with thin transparent glazes, warm porcelain highlights, invisible brushwork in facial features, psychological penetration through direct gaze.

**Pose Flag:** `elegant-contrapposto` (15-25° hip-shoulder S-curve creating theatrical grace)

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance:** Lawrence's Regency bravura technique completely dominates. Subject appears as if Lawrence painted them in oil during Regency period - smooth luminous face, visible hair brushwork, atmospheric fabric rendering, dissolved background edges, theatrical presentation, elegant idealization.

**Mode Selector:** Gallery (Royal Academy exhibition standard with Regency theatrical elegance)

**Final Ratio Confirmation:** Output must be exactly **[SELECT RATIO]**, no exceptions.

------

### 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**RATIO SELECTION BY FORMAT:**

**Three-Quarter Length Portraits (Most Common):**

- Primary: `3:4` (portrait - standard format)
- Alternative: `4:5` (portrait - intimate format)
- Justification: Shows figure from head to mid-thigh or knee, allows elegant pose presentation with atmospheric background

**Full-Length Portraits:**

- Primary: `2:3` (portrait - tall format)
- Alternative: `3:4` (portrait - standard)
- Justification: Life-size theatrical presentation, full costume display, dramatic environmental integration

**Bust Portraits:**

- Primary: `3:4` (portrait - standard)
- Alternative: `1:1` (square - intimate focus)
- Justification: Close psychological engagement, emphasis on face and expression, minimal environmental context

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Ratio Status:** [Native NanoBanana ratio selected]
- **Photo-to-Painting Integration:** Subject extracted from modern context and recomposed into Lawrence's theatrical presentation with Regency costume and atmospheric setting
- **Reframing Method:** Strict reframe - subject repositioned with elegant contrapposto, period-appropriate environment constructed
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure slightly off-center for dynamism, 70-75% figure dominance, 25-30% atmospheric background
- **Background Treatment:** Atmospheric suggestion (stormy skies, landscape hints, architectural elements) rendered loosely, figures emerge from light-filled space
- **Format Justification:** Ratio serves Lawrence's Regency portrait tradition with theatrical elegance and atmospheric integration

### 4) Technical Execution (≥5 Anchors + Measurement Specifications)

**EXPLICIT TEXTURE REQUIREMENTS - CONTROLLED LOOSENESS HIERARCHY:**

Paint surface MUST show DELIBERATE VARIATION in finish level radiating from face outward. This is the defining characteristic of Lawrence's bravura technique - NOT uniform finish across canvas. Face receives maximum precision, backgrounds dissolve into atmospheric gestures.

**CRITICAL HIERARCHY (Measurable Completion Levels):**

- **Face:** 95% finished - smooth, blended, invisible brushwork
- **Hands:** 85% finished - careful modeling with subtle visible strokes
- **Primary fabrics:** 70% finished - selective detail with broken edges
- **Hair:** 70% finished - fluid visible strokes dissolving into atmosphere
- **Secondary elements:** 50% finished - suggestive rendering
- **Backgrounds:** 30% finished - loose atmospheric gestures

**1. Oil Paint Application Anchor - MEASURABLE PAINT PHYSICS:**

**FACE RENDERING (MAXIMUM FINISH - 95% Complete):**

- **Application:** Thin transparent glazes 0.3-0.8mm building luminous porcelain quality
- **Brushwork visibility:** INVISIBLE - smooth blended finish with NO visible stroke marks in facial skin
- **Fine detail brush:** 1-2mm width for precise features (eyes, nostrils, lips, ear details)
- **Broader modeling brush:** 3-4mm width for cheek, forehead, neck transitions with subtle blending
- **Flesh tone transparency:** Paint MUST be thin enough to show canvas luminosity, NOT opaque heavy coverage
- **Highlight treatment:** Porcelain highlights (#f5e8dc) applied as thin luminous layer, not thick paste
- **Shadow treatment:** Warm transparent shadows (#d4b8a8) with gradual soft transitions over 3-6mm distance
- **NO thick paint on face:** Face is built through thin layered glazes, not impasto

**HAIR RENDERING (MODERATE FINISH - 70% Complete):**

- **Brushwork visibility:** HIGHLY VISIBLE - fluid sweeping strokes 5-12mm width
- **Application method:** Loaded brush in confident single-stroke deposits showing directional flow
- **Hair mass width:** Individual masses 8-15mm wide representing groups of hair, NOT fine individual strands
- **Color modulation:** Rich variation within single stroke - dark base to light highlight in one mark
- **Stroke direction:** Following hair fall and form curvature with fluid rhythmic motion
- **Completion strategy:** Hair mass defined but edges atmospheric, creating spontaneous unfinished quality

**HAIR EDGE DISSOLUTION (CRITICAL - Must Blend into Atmosphere):**

- **Transition zone:** Hair MUST dissolve into background through 8-12mm atmospheric blend at periphery
- **Application:** Hair edges become progressively looser and more transparent toward outer boundaries
- **Broken edge requirement:** NO hard cutout edges where hair meets background
- **Stroke integration:** Final hair strokes blend into background atmospheric strokes creating seamless merge
- **Color integration:** Hair color gradually incorporates background atmospheric tones at edges
- **Verification test:** Hair should appear to emerge from atmospheric background, not sit on top of it

**WHITE FABRIC RENDERING (SELECTIVE FINISH - 60-70% Complete):**

- **Impasto highlights:** 2-3mm thick paint ridges in peak illuminated folds creating dimensional relief
- **Shadow glazes:** 0.5-1mm thin transparent application showing canvas texture underneath
- **Brushwork visibility:** MODERATE - 4-8mm visible strokes in fold structures
- **Temperature modulation:** Cool shadows (#d4c4b0) vs. warm highlights (#f5f0e8) creating shimmering silk effect
- **Fold simplification:** Rhythmic simplified patterns, NOT literal photographic complexity
- **White-on-white mastery:** Pure white (#ffffff) peaks, cream mid-tones (#e8dcc8), cool shadow (#d4c4b0), deep fold (#b8a890)

**WHITE FABRIC EDGE DISSOLUTION (CRITICAL):**

- **Edge treatment:** Fabric edges must show 6-10mm dissolved zones where meeting background
- **Broken boundaries:** NO vector-crisp edges - all boundaries show painterly irregularity
- **Application method:** Final fabric strokes overlap with background strokes creating merged zones
- **Highlight edge softening:** Even brightest white highlights must have irregular softened boundaries (3-5mm transition)
- **Verification test:** Edges should appear painted into environment, not cut-and-pasted onto background

**DARK FABRIC RENDERING (SELECTIVE FINISH - 60-70% Complete):**

- **Shadow depth:** Thin transparent glazes 0.5-1mm creating rich velvet darkness
- **Highlight edges:** Selective 2-3mm thick paint at illuminated edges only
- **Color transparency:** Rich warm darks (#1a1410, #3d2820) allowing depth through layered glazes
- **Brushwork visibility:** MINIMAL in shadows, visible at edges and folds
- **Canvas texture:** Must show through thin dark areas creating organic quality

**DARK FABRIC EDGE DISSOLUTION (CRITICAL):**

- **Edge treatment:** Dark fabrics must show 4-8mm broken transitions losing hard boundaries
- **Selective highlights:** Edge highlights (2-3mm thick) must themselves have softened irregular boundaries
- **Application method:** Dark fabric strokes merge with background through overlapping transitional zone
- **NO clean cutouts:** All dark fabric boundaries must show atmospheric integration
- **Verification test:** Dark coat should appear to emerge from shadows, not float on surface

**FUR/TEXTILE TEXTURE RENDERING (IMPRESSIONISTIC - 50-60% Complete):**

- **Textural strokes:** Dragged brush creating fur-like marks 3-6mm length
- **Clustering:** Individual texture strokes grouped in masses, not literal photographic detail
- **Impressionistic suggestion:** Textural quality conveyed through brushwork character, not precise detail
- **Color variation:** Rich modulation within texture suggesting depth and dimension

**BACKGROUND RENDERING (ATMOSPHERIC - 30% Complete):**

- **Brushwork visibility:** MAXIMUM - loose gestural strokes 15-25mm width
- **Application:** Thin washes and sweeping gestures creating atmospheric suggestion
- **Characteristic quality:** Unfinished spontaneous feeling, NOT polished completion
- **Stroke economy:** Minimal marks creating maximum atmospheric effect
- **NO literal detail:** Pure suggestion of stormy skies, landscape elements, architectural hints through color and gesture only

**BACKGROUND STROKE VISIBILITY (CRITICAL - Must Be Obviously Loose):**

- **Individual strokes:** Each background stroke 15-25mm width must remain visible and distinguishable
- **Gestural quality:** Confident sweeping motions showing direction and rhythm
- **Color variation within strokes:** Background strokes show color shift from start to finish of mark
- **Stroke overlap:** Background strokes layer loosely, creating atmospheric depth through transparency
- **NO blended smoothness:** Background must NOT appear airbrushed or gradient-smooth
- **Verification test:** Should be able to count individual background brushstrokes when examining closely

**EDGE TREATMENT BY ZONE (CRITICAL - Proportional Softness):**

- **Face edges:** Soft but defined - 2-4mm gradual transition maintaining form clarity
- **Hand edges:** Soft defined - 3-5mm transition with subtle modeling
- **Fabric edges:** Broken irregular - 4-8mm dissolved zones losing hard boundaries
- **Hair edges:** Completely atmospheric - 8-12mm transition melting into background
- **Background edges:** Total dissolution - 10-15mm atmospheric blend with zero hard boundaries
- **Principle:** Edges soften proportionally to distance from focal point (face)

### 7) Composition & Background

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**For Portrait Ratios (3:4, 4:5, 2:3):**

- Vertical emphasis with elegant standing or seated figure
- Figure dominance 70-75% of canvas
- Atmospheric background 25-30% suggesting environment
- Slight off-center placement for dynamism
- Diagonal compositional lines creating movement

**For Near-Square (1:1, 5:4):**

- Bust or three-quarter length emphasis
- Balanced composition with psychological focus
- Environmental suggestions in corners
- Central but not rigidly symmetrical placement

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**Perspective Regime:**

- Atmospheric perspective creating depth through edge dissolution and value reduction
- NOT rigid linear perspective - intuitive spatial suggestion
- Depth through color temperature shifts (warm foreground to cool distance)
- Selective focus: sharp face dissolving to atmospheric backgrounds

**Figure:Ground Ratio:**

- 70-75% figure/dramatic presentation
- 25-30% atmospheric background
- Background serves figure, never competes for attention
- Environmental elements subordinate to portrait subject

**Lighting Logic:**

- Single theatrical spotlight from upper left (45° angle standard)
- 30% face in full illumination, 45% transitional, 25% soft shadow
- Luminous quality suggesting outdoor natural light, not studio artificial
- Romantic glow creating overall luminosity
- Fabric highlights catching light dramatically

**Detail:Negative Space Ratio:**

- Maximum detail in face (10-15% of canvas)
- Moderate detail in hands, primary fabrics (30-40% of canvas)
- Minimal detail in backgrounds, atmospheric areas (50-60% of canvas)
- Controlled hierarchy directing viewer attention through selective completion

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:** Oil on canvas with Regency-era preparation, Royal Academy exhibition standards, theatrical Grand Manner tradition

**Frame/Band Anchor:** Omit entirely - pure painted achievement with bravura brushwork

**Production Context Anchor:** British Regency period (1790s-1830), Royal Academy tradition, theatrical portraiture, controlled looseness technique demonstrating virtuoso mastery

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for [SELECTED RATIO] with theatrical elegance and atmospheric integration

**Environmental Integration:**

- Stormy skies: Dramatic cloud formations (#3a4a5a, #5a6c7d) suggesting Romantic sublime
- Landscape suggestions: Loose foliage masses (#4a5d3f, #6b7d5a) without literal detail
- Classical architecture: Simple column or drapery suggestions
- Atmospheric depth: Distance created through edge dissolution and value reduction
- All backgrounds rendered loosely (15-25mm strokes) at 30% completion level

------

### 8) Typography & Text Integration

**Binary:** Omit entirely

**Historical Accuracy:** British Regency portraits (1790s-1830) focused purely on painted theatrical achievement through bravura brushwork, luminous technique, and controlled looseness without text integration. Lawrence's revolutionary approach emphasized elegant idealization and psychological penetration through paint alone.

**Format-Specific Rules:** Royal Academy gallery standard emphasizes pure artistic achievement with theatrical elegance and virtuoso technical mastery without textual distraction.
