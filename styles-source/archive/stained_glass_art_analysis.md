**Version:** 4.2 Medieval Specialized **Purpose:** Comprehensive framework for generating authentic Medieval Cathedral stained glass artwork with period-accurate techniques, sacred iconography, and Gothic architectural integration.

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression through medieval artistic conventions.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("2mm lead lines", "3:4 figure elongation") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Traditional glass painting and leading techniques supersede visual appearance descriptions.
- **Sacred Iconography Authority:** Religious symbolism and theological accuracy take precedence over artistic interpretation.
- **Period Authenticity Mandate:** 12th-13th century production methods and aesthetic conventions are mandatory.

**Face-Treatment Flag (mandatory):** `fresco-matte` with sacred iconography **Pose Flag (mandatory):** `hieratic-formal` or `gestural-fluid` (liturgical) **Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` or `format-native` **Material Physics Authority:** Lead came construction, mouth-blown crown glass, and vitreous paint specifications override aesthetic preferences. **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Cathedral viewing distance affects detail hierarchy and lead line thickness (2-4mm standard). **Sacred Production Authenticity:** Monastic workshop methods and liturgical requirements take precedence. **Quantifiers authoritative:** Lead line thickness, figure proportions, and architectural measurements are binding. **Text policy:** Latin inscriptions and sacred texts only when Section 8 authorizes. **Safety/IP:** No nudity except traditional biblical context; no modern elements or anachronisms. **Sacred wardrobe guardrail:** Ecclesiastical vestments, royal regalia, and biblical costume appropriate to period. **Gender expression:** Traditional medieval iconographic conventions. **Material authenticity:** Authentic medieval glass painting techniques, no modern digital effects simulating traditional media. **Composition boundaries:** Lead came framework defines all compositional elements. **Gothic architectural integration:** Windows must function within cathedral structural and spiritual context. **Liturgical coherence:** All elements serve theological narrative and spiritual uplift. **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.
