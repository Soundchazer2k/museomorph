Analyze the provided portrait(s). Redraw the subject entirely from scratch in Hans Holbein the Younger's Northern Renaissance court portrait style (1520s-1540s).

- Preserve likeness through **meticulous realism** and precise character documentation
- **Timeframe:** Tudor court period, peak years (1526-1543)
- **Degree of likeness:** Extremely faithful documentation; unflinching realism with symbolic dignity
- **Emotional tone:** Authoritative, dignified, psychologically penetrating, ceremonially formal
- **Pose conventions:** Frontal or three-quarter view; hands positioned to display rings; formal court stance
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original Tudor court attire and accessories avoiding copyrighted elements
- **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean`
- **Pose Flag:** `frontal-rigid`
- **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance:** Northern European precision overrides any source stylization
- **Mode Selector:** Gallery (museum documentation standard)

The final result must be a masterful painted document combining Northern European precision with royal gravitas.

------

## 2. Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (classical portrait format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely - extend background architectural elements
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned upper-third, hands in lower-third for symbolic display
- **Background Treatment:** Extend rich damask hangings or neutral architectural space seamlessly
- **Format Justification:** 3:4 ratio serves Holbein's formal court documentation tradition with optimal figure-to-background proportion

------

## 3. Artistic Style & Context

**Influences:** Flemish primitive precision, Italian Renaissance dignity, German attention to material detail, court propaganda requirements

**Medium/Production method:** Oil on oak panel with precise glazing techniques. Canvas preparation: chalk ground, multiple thin oil layers, invisible brushwork building luminous surface depth. Paint thickness 2-3mm with scientific color accuracy.

**Thematic purpose:** Official royal documentation and dynastic propaganda serving Tudor court political needs during Protestant Reformation crisis.

**Hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**

- Meticulous textile rendering (every thread and pattern documented)
- Jewelry precision (gemstone reflections, metalwork detail, chain link accuracy)
- Psychological penetration (direct gaze, subtle character revelation)
- Symbolic object placement (rings, pendants, books positioned for meaning)
- Architectural dignity (column capitals, wall hangings, spatial gravitas)

**Period framing:** English Reformation court (1530s-1540s), diplomatic crisis, religious schism, royal marriage politics

**Tone Tag:** Documentary authority, ceremonial dignity, psychological truth, political propaganda

**Production Era Authenticity:** Guild workshop standards, Northern European oil techniques, court painter protocols, diplomatic documentation precision

**Coloring Method:** Rich, deep palette using period pigments; jewel tones (ultramarine, vermillion, gold leaf); precise color matching; symbolic color deployment. Glazing technique: 3-5 transparent layers building luminous depth.

**Texture Specifications:** Fur (1mm individual hair strokes), silk (45-degree highlight angles), velvet (perpendicular pile rendering), metal (mirror-sharp reflections), skin (subtle sfumato transitions). Surface depth: 2-3mm paint thickness with authentic oil behavior.

**Pose Anchors:** Head tilt: 0-15 degrees maximum; shoulder angle: square to picture plane or 15-degree turn; weight distribution: formal balance; gesture economy: minimal movement, hands positioned for ring display.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** All proportions scientifically accurate unless ceremonially enhanced (shoulders broadened 10% maximum for authority).

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic 16th-century oil painting surface with period-appropriate cracking patterns and oil sink-in characteristics.

**Format-Specific Rules:** Museum documentation standard emphasizes pure artistic achievement without textual distraction.

------

## Historical Context Integration

**Protestant Reformation Impact:** Holbein's career pivot from religious art to court portraiture due to iconoclastic destruction of traditional commissions. This crisis forced adaptation to secular patronage, resulting in revolutionary psychological portraiture serving political propaganda needs.

**Court Politics:** Portraits functioned as diplomatic tools during Henry VIII's break with Rome, marriage negotiations, and dynastic propaganda. Each portrait carried political weight requiring absolute accuracy and symbolic sophistication.

**Technical Innovation:** Holbein's synthesis of Flemish precision, Italian dignity, and German material truth created new standard for court portraiture that defined the genre for centuries.

**Cultural Authority:** Works served as definitive visual documents of Tudor court, with Holbein functioning as "the cameraman of Tudor history" whose images became the permanent record of this pivotal historical moment.

**Historical Accuracy:** Spanish court portraits of this period focused purely on psychological and ceremonial painted achievement without text integration. Velázquez's revolutionary approach emphasized the power of naturalistic observation over textual elements.

**Format-Specific Rules:** Museum documentation standard emphasizes pure artistic psychological achievement without textual distraction.

------

## Historical Context Integration

**Revolutionary Technique:** Velázquez's breakthrough innovation was the "manera abreviada" - loose brushwork that appears abstract up close but resolves into startling realism at proper viewing distance. This technique, centuries ahead of its time, directly influenced later Impressionism and modern painting.

**Spanish Court Context:** Portraits served complex dual function - maintaining Habsburg ceremonial dignity while documenting psychological truth with unprecedented honesty. Revolutionary approach to royal imagery emphasizing human character within ceremonial framework.

**Psychological Innovation:** Velázquez's unique genius was "walking along the edge of the precipice" - remaining close to realistic documentation while unlocking "the greatest and deepest things that man can feel." This psychological penetration combined with technical innovation created new paradigm for portraiture.

**Cultural Authority:** Established as "painter of painters" whose influence extended from contemporaries like Rembrandt through modern masters including Manet, Picasso, and Francis Bacon. His revolutionary technique and psychological insight continue to influence artists centuries later.

**Technical Legacy:** His loose brushwork technique was so advanced that forms are defined by patches of hue and light-shadow contrast rather than linear definition - a revolutionary approach that anticipated Impressionism by 200 years and continues to influence contemporary naturalistic painting.

## Historical Context Integration

**Revolutionary Maternal Innovation:** Vigée Le Brun's transformation of aristocratic portraiture through authentic maternal intimacy - first artist to show teeth in smile (scandalous 1787), revolutionary natural hair styling, authentic physical embraces with children inspired by personal motherhood experience.

**Technical Innovation:** Rubens-inspired glazing technique creating "enamel-like quality" through sophisticated layering. Her documented advice: "strong but transparent shadows," "thick golden highlights," building up pictorial surface through colored glazes rather than direct painting.

**International Success:** Twelve-year exile (1789-1801) demonstrated universal appeal of her elegant style across European courts - successful adaptations for Italian, Austrian, and Russian aristocracy while maintaining signature maternal warmth and technical excellence.
