------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `3:4` (manuscript folio format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** manuscript-folio-native with full-page composition
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject placement within architectural or decorative frame ≥60% dominance
- **Background Treatment:** Fill with **solid fields of gold leaf, vibrant color blocks, or abstract decorative patterns**
- **Format Justification:** Portrait folio serves Ottonian hieratic and ceremonial formality

------

## 3) Artistic Style & Context

**Medium/Production Method:** Iron gall ink and natural pigments on calf vellum with traditional manuscript preparation. **Primary technique:** **Abstract-expressive synthesis** - rejection of Carolingian naturalism for a more stylized, spiritually intense, and abstract approach. **Surface preparation:** Parchment from luxury codices, 23-karat gold leaf application.

**Thematic Purpose:** Imperial self-representation, liturgical authority display, emphasis on the spiritual power of the emperor/abbess; presentation of the codex as an offering to God or a saint.

**Period Framing:** **Ottonian Renaissance (c. 950-1050 CE)**. **Major scriptoria:** Reichenau, Trier, Hildesheim. **Innovation:** Development of a distinctly German style, abstracting classical models for spiritual intensity, strong reliance on Byzantine models for imperial iconography.

**5 Hallmark Motifs with Quantified Specifications:**

1. **Abstract Expressive Figures:** Elongated, stylized bodies; highly schematic yet emotionally intense faces (large, staring eyes); minimal attempt at naturalistic proportion
2. **Hieratic Frontality:** Figures often presented frontally, especially imperial or sacred subjects, emphasizing spiritual presence and authority
3. **Layered Flat Drapery:** Cloth rendered in **geometric, linear, and brightly colored blocks** with little or no attempt at realistic volume or shadow (strong contrast with Carolingian). The folds often create abstract, repeating patterns
4. **Vibrant Color Fields:** Use of large, flat areas of brilliant, saturated color (especially reds, blues, greens) separated by bold outlines, often against a gold background
5. **Decorative Architectural Frames:** Highly stylized Romanesque architectural elements, often with exaggerated scale or symbolic function, used to frame the main figure(s)

**Tone Tag:** Imperial, hieratic, spiritual intensity, abstract formalism.

**Production Era Authenticity:** **10th/11th-century** monastic workshop methods using documented materials and techniques.

------

## 4) Technical Execution

**Line Quality & Tool Marks:** Iron gall ink applied with quill pens cut to 2-3mm width. **Bold, heavy contour lines (2-4mm)** separating flat color fields. Internal lines are often expressive and linear, defining the abstract folds of the drapery.

**Abstract-Formalist Technique Synthesis:**

- **Structural Foundation:** Iron gall ink framework
- **Volume Modeling:** **Minimal to no chiaroscuro or realistic shadow**; volume suggested by the juxtaposition of color blocks or simple, stylized linear highlights
- **Stylized Drapery:** Geometric and highly linear rendering of folds, creating abstract patterns rather than realistic fabric behavior
- **Expressive Characterization:** Focus on **large, prominent, staring eyes** and schematic facial features to convey spiritual intensity or psychological state

**Authentic Ottonian Pigment Palette:**

- **Red:** Vermillion (mercuric sulfide), Red Lead
- **Blue:** Ultramarine (lapis lazuli) for luxury, Azurite
- **Yellow:** Ochre (earth pigment)
- **Green:** Verdigris (copper acetate), Malachite
- **Purple:** Lichen extract (folium/orcein)
- **White:** Lead White, Chalk
- **Black:** Carbon black (soot-based)
- **Gold:** 23-karat gold leaf for backgrounds and highlights, shell gold for details

**Color Application Method:** **Flat application of saturated, brilliant colors with bold black/brown outlines.** The brilliance of the palette is a key Ottonian characteristic.

**Texture Specifications:** Manuscript technique with 0.5-1mm paint thickness; gold leaf ≈0.1mm.

**Scale Hierarchy:** **Strictly hierarchical** - spiritual or imperial importance determines size and frontality (e.g., the emperor/saint is larger than surrounding figures).

**Material Authenticity:** Authentic 10th/11th-century techniques with visible parchment texture.

------

## 5) Fashion & Attire - Wardrobe Matrix + Prop Selector

**Wardrobe Tracks:**

- **Imperial/Sacred:** Highly stylized robes often derived from Roman and Byzantine court dress (e.g., chlamys), rendered in flat, patterned color blocks
- **Monastic/Clerical:** Simple robes with clear, bold linear decoration
- **Biblical/Evangelical:** Symbolic, brightly colored classical-style robes showing abstract geometric folds

**Fabric Behavior:** **Abstract, geometric, linear folds**; fabric acts as a surface for color and pattern, not a realistic physical object.

**Accessory Caps:** Imperial/Ecclesiastical contexts (3-5 items) - crowns, scepters, jeweled gospel books, dedicatory models, palms of martyrdom.

**Color Palette:** Brilliant reds, golds, ultramarine blues in flat fields.

**Props YAML:**

```yaml
hero_props:
  - jeweled_gospel_book: "treasure binding with enamel, gems, and gold"
  - dedicatory_codex: "model of a church or book held as an offering"
  - imperial_insignia: "orb and scepter, imperial crown"

- Sacred/Imperial figure dominance ≥60% with decorative or architectural framing
- Hierarchical staging emphasizing spiritual and temporal authority
- Emphasis on large, simple shapes and clear outlines

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Spatial Logic:** **Flat, two-dimensional space** created by color blocks and gold leaf, deliberately rejecting realistic depth
- **Figure:Ground:** 60% stylized figures, 40% symbolic backgrounds (gold fields, patterned textiles, abstract architecture)
- **Lighting Logic:** **Flat, symbolic illumination**; color is the primary carrier of meaning, not light/shadow
- **Detail Distribution:** Maximum precision on symbolic elements (crowns, books), stylized/abstract treatment of figures and backgrounds

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context:** Parchment manuscript page with authentic texture
- **Frame/Band:** Decorative borders or highly stylized Romanesque architectural frames

**Script Requirements:**

- **Primary:** Carolingian Minuscule (clear script for main text)
- **Display:** Capitalis Quadrata, Uncial for headings or labels
- **Special:** Gold/silver ink for luxury commissions

**Font Recommendations:**

**Production Integration:** Authentic quill pen characteristics, iron gall ink, manuscript spacing.

------

## Ottonian-Specific Revolutionary Synthesis

**Core Innovation:** **Rejection of Carolingian naturalism** for a style prioritizing spiritual intensity, abstraction, and hierarchical formalism. Strong influence from Byzantine models for imperial iconography fused with local German expressive power (Reichenau school).

**Material Hierarchy:**

- **Luxury Imperial:** Full palette including ultramarine, gold backgrounds, vermillion
- **Working Manuscripts:** Limited to ochres, red lead, minimal gold

**School Variations:**

- **Reichenau:** High abstraction, intense emotional expression, emphasis on eyes, bright palette
- **Trier/Echternach:** More ornamental, strong use of gold

**Authentication Requirements:** Every element reflects 10th/11th-century capabilities - no Carolingian-level naturalistic volume, no Gothic S-curve, no modern pigments.

- **Material Physics Authority:** 15th-century substrate, pigment, and binding agent specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Magnification-assisted precision affects detail hierarchy and brushwork standards.
- **Atmospheric Innovation Authority:** Revolutionary weather effects and landscape treatment take precedence over earlier medieval symbolic backgrounds.
- **Text policy:** Gothic script integration - Textura for luxury, Gothic Cursive for official documents, coordinated with illumination programs.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no modern logos/watermarks/signatures.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Class-appropriate garments reflecting feudal hierarchy with realistic markers of social status.
- **Composition boundaries:** Gothic decorative borders integral to composition, no external modern frames.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid Renaissance perspective, Romantic idealization, Victorian medieval revival, digital photography effects.
