- **Format Justification:** 3:4 portrait ratio serves Goya's intimate psychological studies and allows for figure dominance with atmospheric depth
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Goya's Black Paintings (1820-1823), Romantic pessimism, post-illness psychological transformation, Spanish political turmoil **Medium/Production method:** Oil paint applied al secco directly onto plaster walls using broad strokes, large brushes, palette knives, and possibly sponges. Thick impasto with 3-5mm paint thickness, no preparatory drawings. **Thematic purpose:** Private psychological expression of deepest fears, political disillusionment, and human darkness **Hallmark motifs:**

- Chiaroscuro lighting with 90% darkness, 10% dramatic illumination
- Figures emerging from "avernal darkness"
- Off-center compositional imbalance (150% modern asymmetry)
- Thick, agitated brushwork showing tool marks and palette knife scraping
