**Mode Selector:** Album cover (vinyl LP format)

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `1:1` (album cover/vinyl LP standard)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** recompose-entirely (Saville often omitted conventional subject matter)
- **Spatial Allocation:** Central geometric focal point OR asymmetric grid division OR complete text-based composition
- **Background Treatment:** Solid matte color fields (beige, grey, black, white) OR minimal gradient transitions OR appropriated classical painting reproduction
- **Format Justification:** Square format enables perfect mathematical divisions, radial symmetry, and modular color coding systems essential to Factory aesthetic

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Swiss International Style (Josef M√ºller-Brockmann), Jan Tschichold's "New Typography," Bauhaus geometric principles, minimalist conceptual art, scientific data visualization.

**Medium/Production Method:** Offset lithography on textured cardstock with precise CMYK color separation. Advanced techniques include thermographic printing (900-1300¬∞F embossing), PMT camera reproduction for photographic elements, modular color coding systems. Late Factory period incorporated early digital typesetting (1985+).

**Thematic Purpose:** Intellectual detachment, scientific objectivity, anti-rock-star aesthetic, enigmatic conceptual packaging that refuses conventional music industry marketing.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Scientific diagrams** (pulsar charts, astronomical data, wave patterns)
2. **Appropriated classical art** (Renaissance paintings, 19th-century still lifes)
3. **Mathematical color systems** (modular alphabets, coded progressions)
4. **Extreme minimalism** (single centered images, vast negative space)
5. **Typography as primary element** (often omitting band names, using abstract number systems)

**Period Framing:** 1979-1990 Factory Records era, post-punk/new wave aesthetic rebellion against prog rock excess.

**Tone Tag:** Clinical, intellectual, enigmatic, austere, conceptually rigorous.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Standard offset lithography (1979-1984), thermographic embossing for special releases, transition to early digital pre-press (1985+) while maintaining analog aesthetic. PMT camera work for photographic integration.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line work:** Precise geometric division using ruler-straight edges, no organic or hand-drawn elements. Scientific diagrams rendered with technical precision (80 consecutive pulsar wave lines at exact intervals).

**Color:** Restricted palettes of 2-4 colors maximum. Muted modernist tones (beige #F5F5DC, cool grey #808080, black #000000, white #FFFFFF) with occasional single accent (reflex blue, process cyan). Mathematical color progressions for coding systems.

**Texture:** Flat matte offset lithography on textured cardstock. NO glossy finishes. Thermographic embossing creates 0.5-1mm raised surface on select elements.

**Edge Treatment:** Sharp vector precision for geometric elements. Appropriated imagery maintains original painting texture through careful halftone screening.

**Detail Hierarchy:** Extreme restraint - single central element occupying 15-40% of canvas, surrounded by vast negative space. Typography minimal, often 8-12pt size.

**Pose Anchors:** When human figures included (rare), frontal rigid positioning, 0¬∞ head tilt, symmetrical weight distribution.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Mathematical proportions based on golden ratio or modular grid systems. Text size deliberately small (body text 8-10pt, titles 14-18pt maximum).

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic offset lithography halftone patterns (133-150 LPI screen frequency), visible dot structure on close inspection. Cardstock texture (280-350gsm weight) affects ink absorption creating characteristic matte surface.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** Pre-digital production methods (1979-1984) include PMT camera stats, hand-cut Letraset, photographic color separation. Post-1985 early digital maintains analog aesthetic through careful screening.

**Production Method Anchor:** Standard 4-color offset printing with precise registration (¬±0.5mm tolerance). Special techniques: thermographic powder embossing, spot varnish refusal (maintaining matte surfaces), debossing for Factory catalog numbers.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Square format enables radial symmetry, perfect quadrant division, centered single-point focus that Saville exploited for maximum impact.

------
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **1:1 ratio** (album cover) OR **2:1 ratio** (gatefold) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Redraw subject in **Roger Dean's fantasy landscape style** for **progressive rock album artwork**.

Identity via **symbolic mythologization** - subject becomes tiny traveler or mystical figure within vast cosmic-fantasy landscape. Subject serves as **scale indicator** rather than protagonist, dwarfed by otherworldly environment.

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original fantasy landscapes avoiding reproduction of specific Yes/Asia iconography while maintaining organic architectural and floating island motifs.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `watercolor-soft` with `wet-on-wet-bleed` characteristics

**Pose Flag:** `gestural-fluid` (when figures included, typically as tiny silhouettes)

**Canvas Control Flag:** `adaptive-extend` (organic landscapes extend naturally to fill canvas)

**Style Dominance:** Organic architectural fantasy and cosmic natural forms override realistic representation.

**Mode Selector:** Album cover (vinyl LP or gatefold format)

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `1:1` (standard album) OR `2:1` (gatefold panorama)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend (organic landscape elements flow naturally to fill ratio)
- **Spatial Allocation:** Vast cosmic landscape dominates (70-90%), tiny figures positioned as scale indicators (5-10%)
- **Background Treatment:** Ethereal skies with luminous color gradients, floating islands, alien vegetation extending to all edges
- **Format Justification:** Square format concentrates cosmic vision; 2:1 gatefold enables epic panoramic alien worlds with elaborate organic architecture

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Surrealism, Art Nouveau organic forms, Chinese/Japanese landscape painting, ecological themes, botanical illustration, visionary art.

**Medium/Production Method:** Watercolor and gouache on thick 640gsm rough paper creating broken, uneven paint effects. Process: Initial splashes/shapes allowed to evolve organically, then tightened with detailed finishing. Scalpel used to scratch highlights into dried paint. Experimental techniques include spraying water and color, gravity manipulation, negative space painting (forms created by painting around them), layered transparent washes building luminosity.

**Thematic Purpose:** Create immersive fantasy worlds functioning as alternate universes for progressive rock's cosmic explorations. Worlds that feel ecologically plausible despite impossibility.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Floating islands** with root systems dangling into void
2. **Organic architecture** (bone-like structures, living buildings)
3. **Crystalline mountains** with transparent geological formations
4. **Alien vegetation** (curvilinear foliage, exotic ecosystems)
5. **Cosmic oceans** with impossible water behavior

**Period Framing:** 1970s-1980s progressive rock golden age, peak visionary landscape painting.

**Tone Tag:** Mystical, visionary, expansive, ecologically harmonious, cosmically optimistic.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Traditional watercolor/gouache techniques with experimental material manipulation. No digital enhancement - all luminosity achieved through layered transparent pigments, scratched highlights, controlled water effects.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line work:** Fluid curvilinear contours defining floating islands and organic architecture. Controlled fine linework for rock textures and foliage detail. Exploratory initial marks refined through careful edge definition.

**Color mixing:** Luminous watercolor/gouache washes in jewel tones. Transparent layering builds saturation. Honey-based watercolors provide exceptional color depth. Palette: ethereal blues, mystical purples, alien greens, sunset oranges, cosmic pinks.

**Texture thickness:** Thick 640gsm paper creates broken paint application. Scratched highlights create physical texture (0.1-0.3mm depth). Watercolor pooling creates organic marbling effects. Gouache provides opaque detail over transparent washes.

**Edge treatment:** Soft wet-on-wet blending for atmospheric elements. Sharp negative-space edges for architectural forms. Scalpel-scratched highlights create crisp linear accents.

**Stroke economy:** Initial loose experimental marks establish composition. Refined detailing added in final layers. Negative space painting requires precise brush control around preserved areas.

**Surface depth:** Multiple transparent watercolor layers create luminous depth (3-7 layers typical). Gouache highlights sit physically on surface. Scratched areas reveal white paper beneath pigment layers.

**Detail hierarchy:** Hyper-detailed clusters (rock formations, vegetation) contrast with atmospheric voids. Foreground sharp, background softly dissolved into cosmic haze.

**Pose Anchors:** Tiny figures (when included) positioned as lone travelers, cloaked/robed, architectural scale rather than protagonists. Positioned at 1/3 or 2/3 compositional points for visual balance.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Vast landscapes dwarf any human elements (figures 2-5% of composition). Floating islands span 40-60% of canvas. Organic architecture reaches 30-50% scale.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic watercolor granulation, pigment settling patterns, gouache opacity variations, paper texture affecting paint flow. Scalpel scratches visible as white linear highlights cutting through paint layers.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** Pre-digital painting requiring physical material manipulation. All effects achieved through water control, gravity, careful layering, subtractive techniques (scratching, lifting).

**Production Method Anchor:** Original paintings photographed for reproduction. Offset lithography struggles to capture watercolor luminosity - requires careful color separation to approximate transparent wash depth.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Compositions designed for specific ratios - 1:1 concentrates cosmic moment, 2:1 enables epic journey across alien vista with multiple floating islands and organic structures.

------
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks:**

- **Mystical travelers:** Cloaked figures, robed silhouettes, fantasy medieval-inspired garments
- **Scale indicators:** Tiny figures in simple attire emphasizing vastness of environment
- **Occasionally absent:** Landscapes often completely uninhabited

**Fabric Behavior:** When visible, flowing robes suggesting movement through alien atmosphere. Simplified forms due to tiny scale.

**Accessory Caps:** Minimalist 0-1 (staffs, simple traveling gear when figures present)

**Color Palette:** Muted earth tones for figures contrast with vivid cosmic landscape. Figure colors subordinate to environment.

**Vocabulary Warnings:** Avoid "digital," "rendered," "computer-generated," "vector," "synthetic." Embrace "painted," "organic," "flowing," "luminous," "atmospheric."

------
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**For 1:1 Square:**

- Concentrated cosmic vision with central floating island
- Radial composition emanating from core structure
- Equal weight distribution through organic symmetry
- Atmospheric depth receding to all four edges

**For 2:1 Gatefold:**

- Epic panoramic alien landscape extending across width
- Multiple floating islands positioned at rhythmic intervals
- Journey narrative implied through compositional flow left-to-right
- Interconnected organic elements creating visual continuity

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective:** Aerial/elevated viewpoint revealing vast cosmic vistas
- **Grid/Symmetry:** Organic balance rather than mathematical precision
- **Figure:Ground:** 10:90 ratio (environment dominates)
- **Density:** Contrast between hyper-detailed clusters and atmospheric voids
- **Lighting Logic:** Ethereal cosmic illumination from multiple impossible sources
- **Detail:Negative Space:** 30:70 ratio (detailed elements surrounded by atmospheric depth)

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:** Vinyl LP album sleeve, offset lithography attempting to reproduce watercolor luminosity, coated art paper (170-200gsm) for best color reproduction.

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT entirely unless organic decorative border grows from landscape itself (Art Nouveau-inspired natural frames).

**Production Context Anchor:** Offset lithography from painted originals, 6-8 color separations attempting to capture transparent watercolor depth, carefully calibrated to preserve luminosity.

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition flows organically to fill declared ratio, floating islands and cosmic elements positioned specifically for square or panoramic format.

------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** ALLOW (typography integrated as organic element)

**Ratio-Appropriate Zones:**

- Typography morphs into landscape shapes
- Letters grow from organic structures
- Custom hand-drawn integration
- Bottom third placement common for band logos

**Copy Limits:**

- Band name as custom logo (Yes, Asia style)
- Album title minimal or absent from front
- Typography becomes architectural element of landscape

**Period-Appropriate Typography:**

- **Custom lettering:** Organic, hand-drawn logos appearing grown from landscape
- **Art Nouveau influence:** Flowing, curvilinear letterforms
- **Integration method:** Typography becomes part of world rather than applied text

**Font Recommendations:**

- **Google Font:** Eczar or Cinzel Decorative (70% approximation of organic custom lettering)
- **Better Match:** Custom hand-drawn lettering specific to each album, Arnold B√∂cklin for Art Nouveau reference

**Format-Specific Rules (Album Cover):**

- Front cover: Custom logo integrated into landscape design
- Logo appears as natural growth from cosmic elements
- Typography subordinate to environmental immersion
- Text should look "grown from same organic world"

**Historical Accuracy:** All typography hand-drawn and custom designed, integrated during painting process or carefully added to maintain organic unity with landscape.

**Production Method Integration:** Typography painted/drawn as part of original artwork, reproduced through same offset lithography process as landscape elements, maintaining tonal integration.

- **Background Treatment:** Solid color fields (blues, blacks, oranges, greens) OR duotone photographic backgrounds
- **Format Justification:** Square format enables perfect modular division, rotated typography, mathematical grid precision

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Bauhaus, Swiss Modernism, European poster design, American abstract expressionism, jazz improvisation translated to visual rhythm.

**Medium/Production Method:** High-contrast photography by Francis Wolff, reduced to duotone or spot color. Hot-metal typesetting using Intertype line-casting machines (pre-1966) then Linotype Spartan (post-1966). Offset lithography with specialized inks (greenish-tint, reflex blue). Typography manipulated as visual element - fragmented, stacked, rotated, enlarged/reduced asymmetrically.

**Thematic Purpose:** Build consistent Blue Note brand identity through sophisticated modernist design, elevate jazz packaging to high art, create visual rhythm paralleling musical improvisation.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Bold typography** as dominant visual element (often larger than photography)
2. **Tight cropping** of musician portraits (eyes, instruments, hands)
3. **Duotone colorization** (black + single accent color)
4. **Rotated compositions** (45¬∞ angles, tilted frames)
5. **Heavy negative space** used rhythmically

**Period Framing:** 1955-1967 Blue Note golden age, peak modernist jazz design era.

**Tone Tag:** Cool, sophisticated, urban, rhythmic, intellectually accessible.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Hot-metal typesetting (1955-1966) creating distinct letterform characteristics, transition to phototypesetting (1966-1967) with Linotype Spartan fonts. Offset lithography with precise color registration, specialized Blue Note ink formulations.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Photography specifications:** Contax or Leica 35mm cameras (Francis Wolff), Kodak Tri-X 400 film, high-contrast printing to eliminate mid-tones. Tight cropping isolating facial features, instruments, hands in extreme close-up.

**Film/Grain:** Kodak Tri-X pushed to high contrast, visible grain structure at print scale, deliberate loss of shadow/highlight detail for graphic impact.

**Line work:** Sharp photographic edges combined with bold typographic outlines. Letterforms treated as geometric shapes with crisp vector precision.

**Color:** Restricted palettes - black + single accent color. Blues (#003366 reflex blue, #4169E1 royal blue), oranges (#FF8C00), greens (#228B22 greenish-tint), occasional reds. Duotone printing technique overlays photography with colored halftone screens.

**Texture:** Smooth offset lithography on quality paperstock. Halftone dot structure visible (120-133 LPI screen frequency). High-quality paper prevents ink bleeding, maintains sharp edges.

**Typography manipulation:** Letters fragmented, stacked vertically, rotated 45-90¬∞, enlarged to massive scale, shrunk to tiny accents. Sans-serif fonts (Haas Inserat-Grotesk, Ultra Bodoni, Clarendon) treated as modular building blocks.

**Pose Anchors:** Musicians photographed candidly - head tilted examining instrument, fingers on keys, contemplative expressions. When frontal, direct eye contact with camera creating psychological intensity.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Typography often dominates at 200-400% size of photography. Musician portraits occupy 30-50% of canvas, typography fills remaining space aggressively.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic offset lithography halftone patterns, hot-metal typesetting imperfections (slight variations in letter spacing, baseline shifts). Ink density variations characteristic of 1960s printing.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** Pre-1966 Intertype typesetting creates subtle irregularities. Post-1966 Linotype Spartan shows distinctive horizontal serifs on numeral "1". Photography always high-contrast black/white or duotone, never full-color.

**Production Method Anchor:** Standard 2-color offset printing (black + spot color) OR 3-color (black + two accents). Registration tolerance ¬±1mm acceptable, creating characteristic slight color shifts. Specialized Blue Note inks mixed to exact formulations.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Square format exploited through rotated compositions, diagonal typography cutting across quadrants, modular grid divisions creating visual rhythm.

- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject dominates 80-95% of frame, minimal background space
- **Background Treatment:** Pure flat color field (single solid color, no gradients)
- **Format Justification:** Square format enables centered frontal portrait, symmetrical color blocking, repetition grids (when multiple portraits)

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Commercial advertising, celebrity photography, mass production aesthetics, consumer product packaging.

**Medium/Production Method:** Photo-silkscreen printing - light-sensitive emulsion applied to silk mesh screens, film positives exposed creating blocked areas, acrylic inks pushed through screens using rubber squeegee. Process creates flat color blocks with sharp edges, intentional misregistration between layers embraced as Factory aesthetic. High-contrast photographic negatives reduce subjects to bold graphic shapes.

**Thematic Purpose:** Collapse boundaries between fine art and commerce, treat celebrity/subject as consumer product, explore mechanical reproduction and seriality, deadpan ironic commentary on fame.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **High-contrast reduction** (subjects flattened to 3-4 value zones)
2. **Bold color blocking** (hot pink, acid yellow, cyan, magenta, electric blue)
3. **Repetition grids** (same image repeated with color variations)
4. **Commercial aesthetics** (packaging-like presentation)
5. **Deliberate imperfection** (registration drift, uneven ink coverage)

**Period Framing:** 1964-1987 Factory era, peak Pop Art album cover production.

**Tone Tag:** Deadpan, ironic, commercially cool, celebrity-obsessed, mechanically detached.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Factory silkscreen process with characteristic ink variations, registration shifts, embrace of mechanical reproduction "flaws" as artistic elements.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Line work:** Single strong contour outlines OR no outlines (color blocks meet at sharp edges). Photographic reduction to pure black/white creates edge definition.

**Color:** Strictly 3-4 ultra-saturated colors - hot pink (#FF69B4), acid yellow (#FFFF00), cyan (#00FFFF), magenta (#FF00FF), electric blue (#0000FF), deep black (#000000). Day-glo, fluorescent quality to pigments.

**Texture:** Perfectly flat silkscreen ink coverage, slight screen mesh texture (200-305 threads per inch), minimal variation. Acrylic inks create matte or semi-gloss surface depending on formulation.

**Edge treatment:** Sharp photographic edges where colors meet, slight registration drift (0.5-2mm offset) between color layers creating characteristic Warhol "mistake" aesthetic.

**Detail reduction:** Eyes, nose, mouth simplified to flat contrasting shapes. Hair becomes solid color mass. Skin flattened to 2-3 tonal zones. No gradients or modeling.

**Pose Anchors:** Centered frontal positioning, head/shoulders cropped tight at chest level, 0¬∞ head tilt, direct frontal gaze or slight 15¬∞ angle, symmetrical composition.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Subject fills 80-95% of canvas, face occupies 60-70% of total area, features reduced to essential geometric zones.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic silkscreen ink flatness, no painterly blending. Mesh pattern barely visible in solid color areas. Acrylic ink sits on surface rather than absorbing into paper.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** Factory production methods require manual screen registration creating characteristic slight shifts between color layers. Embrace imperfection as authentic element.

**Production Method Anchor:** Each color requires separate screen - 3-4 screens minimum. Registration marks trimmed in final production. Inks mixed to exact color specifications, applied in sequence (typically dark to light or light to dark).

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Square 1:1 format perfect for centered portrait, enables repetition grids when using serial imagery approach.

**Mode Selector:** Album cover (vinyl LP or CD format)

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `1:1` (album cover standard)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** adaptive-extend (organic distortions and fabric elements extend naturally)
- **Spatial Allocation:** Obscured figure fragments (30-50%), textured surfaces and overlays (40-60%), typography integration (10-20%)
- **Background Treatment:** Abstract voids, mottled textures, stained surfaces creating ambiguous space
- **Format Justification:** Square format enables radial obscuration patterns, centered mysterious focal points, symmetrical textile draping

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Surrealism, punk DIY aesthetics elevated through craft, European art cinema, gothic romanticism, analog photography experimentation.

**Medium/Production Method:** PMT (Photo Mechanical Transfer) camera creating high-contrast black/white reproductions with characteristic underexposed edges exploited for atmospheric effects. Process: photograph ripped-up taped-together Japanese rag paper arrangements, use PMT to create base materials, manually redrive edges with scalpel after enlargement to foot-high sizes. Collaborate with photographers (Simon Larbalestier) creating solarized images, constructed sets, veiled subjects. Resist digital technology - "they took my tools away."

**Thematic Purpose:** Create ambiguous ethereal mystery, suggest rather than state, evoke dreamlike unease, elevate indie rock packaging to fine art through meticulous craft.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Veiled/shrouded figures** (lace, fabric obscuring identity)
2. **Fragmented body parts** (hands, silhouettes, partial forms)
3. **Distressed typography** (scalpel-manipulated, distorted letterforms)
4. **Tactile textures** (stains, bruises, organic decay)
5. **Ghostly overlays** (multiple exposures, translucent layers)

**Period Framing:** 1983-2000 4AD golden age, peak analog design resistance to digital tools.

**Tone Tag:** Mysterious, ethereal, unsettling, dreamlike, tactilely intimate.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Analog-only workflow through 1990s - PMT cameras, manual distortion, collaborative darkroom work. Violent resistance to digital transition preserving hands-on control.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**PMT Camera specifications:** Photo Mechanical Transfer creating high-contrast black/white stats with characteristic underexposed edge darkness exploited as atmospheric element. Manual focus variations creating soft veiled effects.

**Texture creation:** Deep photographic grain, deliberate stains, scratches. Surfaces appear aged, bruised, tactile. Japanese rag paper provides organic torn-edge textures. Multiple layers creating archaeological depth.

**Color:** Mottled desaturated tones - bruised blues (#4A5A7A), rusty ochres (#B8860B), smoky greys (#696969). Colors appear as organic stains rather than applied pigments.

**Typography distortion:** Letterforms enlarged to foot-high scale on PMT, then manually redriven with scalpel creating distressed irregular edges. Type appears rubbed, scratched, ghosted into surface.

**Layering technique:** Disjointed surreal collages where elements overlap imperfectly, like archaeological palimpsests. Cut-and-paste scraps creating fragmented narratives.

**Human element treatment:** Always obscured - blurred, veiled, shrouded in lace/fabric, reduced to shadow/silhouette. Identity suggested never stated.

**Detail hierarchy:** Micro-textural details (grain, scratches, stains) contrast with obscured macro forms. Surface intimacy versus compositional ambiguity.

**Pose Anchors:** When figures visible, contorted psychological tension, turned away, faces obscured by fabric/hands, uncomfortable positioning suggesting unease.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Typography often dominates at 40-60% scale, figures fragmented across 30-50%, textures fill remaining space creating horror vacui.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic PMT camera artifacts - underexposed edges, high-contrast grain, characteristic black crush. No digital smoothing or enhancement.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** All effects achieved through analog photography, PMT manipulation, manual scalpel work, collaborative darkroom experimentation. Digital tools explicitly rejected.

**Production Method Anchor:** Offset lithography attempting to reproduce PMT textures, stochastic screening for grain preservation, careful color separation maintaining mottled tonal qualities.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Square format enables centered mysterious focal points, radial fabric draping, symmetrical fragmentation patterns.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Traditional Renaissance painting techniques requiring months of layer buildup, no modern shortcuts or digital enhancement.

------
## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

**Underpainting:** Egg tempera establishing complete tonal structure - careful value modeling creating three-dimensional form through transparent pigment layers.

**Glazing layers:** Oil paint mixed with dammar resin applied in 10-30 transparent layers, each modifying underlying color. Luminosity achieved through light penetrating multiple translucent layers and reflecting back from white gesso ground.

**Color depth:** Honey-based watercolors and high-quality oil pigments creating exceptional saturation. Colors appear to glow from within through glazing technique.

**Detail density:** Microscopic scenes embedded within larger narrative - every square inch contains multiple layers of symbolic detail requiring magnification to appreciate fully.

**Surface quality:** Smooth oil paint surface with subtle texture from brush application, no impasto or heavy texture. Luminous quality from multiple transparent layers.

**Pose Anchors:** Subjects positioned hieratically (formal sacred positioning) or in erotic tension - reclining nudes, dancing figures, mystical embraces. Cultural traditions respected (Hindu mudras, African ritual poses).

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Central figures dominate (40-60%), surrounded by cosmic landscape (30-50%), microscopic narrative details (10-20%).

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic egg tempera/oil glazing technique creating characteristic luminosity impossible with other methods. Surface appears to glow from within.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** Renaissance painting techniques applied to psychedelic subject matter - technical mastery serving visionary content.

**Production Method Anchor:** Paintings photographed for album reproduction, offset lithography struggling to capture tempera/oil luminosity. Requires careful color separation with 6-8 plates attempting to approximate glowing quality.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Square format enables mandala-like radial compositions, centered mystical figures, cosmic environments extending to all edges.

**Processing:** Extended development times in D-76 or HC-110 developers, push processing 1-3 stops, careful temperature control for consistent grain structure.

**Lighting:** Natural light preference - overcast skies, open shade, minimal reflector use. When artificial light used, single source creating dramatic shadows.

**Printing:** Traditional gelatin silver printing, selective dodging/burning creating deep blacks and brilliant highlights, fiber-based papers for archival quality.

**Artifacts:** Film grain structure, slight halation around highlights, edge sharpness from quality lenses, characteristic Tri-X tonal curve.

**Pose Anchors:** Subjects standing still in empty landscapes, European-style body positioning (formal, reserved), arms at sides or minimal gesture, direct eye contact or contemplative gaze away.

**Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Subject typically 30-50% of frame, surrounded by environmental context. Empty space serves compositional purpose.

**Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic film grain structure, no digital simulation. Darkroom printing artifacts (dust spots acceptable as period authenticity), fiber paper texture.

**Period Consistency Anchor:** Analog workflow essential - film photography, darkroom printing, no digital manipulation beyond scanning for reproduction.

**Production Method Anchor:** Original fiber prints or carefully scanned negatives for album reproduction, halftone screening attempting to preserve film grain character.

**Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition respects photographic framing conventions, environmental context integral to imagery.

## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

**Wardrobe Tracks:**

- **Dark minimalist:** Black coats, dark suits, leather jackets, heavy boots
- **Timeless simplicity:** White shirts, simple t-shirts, muted tones
- **Never flashy:** Avoid bright colors, patterns, ornamental details

**Fabric Behavior:** Natural drape of wool coats, leather weight, cotton simplicity. Clothing enhances stoic presence.

**Accessory Caps:** Minimal 0-2 (hats occasionally, sunglasses rare, minimal jewelry)

**Color Palette:** Monochrome rendering - blacks, greys, whites in photographic tones. Clothing muted even when color film used.

**Props (YAML Pool):**

```yaml
anton_corbijn_props:
  environmental_elements:
    - landscapes: [desert_plains, barren_fields, empty_horizons, cloudy_skies]
    - architecture: [stark_walls, concrete_structures, industrial_ruins, minimal_interiors]
  symbolic_objects:
    - religious_icons: [crosses, religious_imagery, symbolic_props]
    - minimal_elements: [single_chair, window_light, doorway_frame]
  atmospheric_conditions:
    - weather: [overcast_diffusion, dramatic_clouds, harsh_sunlight, fog_mystery]
    - time: [golden_hour_contrast, midday_stark, twilight_mood]
```

**Coherence Filter:** All elements support stoic band mythology. Default = subject against stark wall or empty landscape.

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

**‚ùå Canvas Negatives:**

- "bright cheerful colors"
- "glossy fashion photography"
- "digital smoothing"
- "Instagram filters"
- "HDR processing"
- "soft focus glamour"
- "busy backgrounds"
- "decorative props"
- "smiling expressions"
- "commercial polish"

**‚úÖ Canvas Positives:**

- "exactly 1:1 square ratio" OR "exactly 4:3 portrait ratio"
- "Kodak Tri-X 400 grain structure"
- "push processed 800-3200 ISO"
- "high contrast monochrome"
- "stark empty landscapes"
- "stoic serious expression"
- "natural light cinematography"
- "darkroom dodging and burning"
- "film noir aesthetic"
- "mythic band portraiture"

**Vocabulary Warnings:** Avoid "cheerful," "bright," "glossy," "polished," "commercial." Embrace "stoic," "stark," "cinematic," "devotional," "grainy."

## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**For 1:1 Square (Album Cover):**

- Centered or off-center subject placement
- Significant negative space
- Environmental context integral
- Symmetrical or rule-of-thirds framing

**For 4:3 Portrait:**

- Classic portrait proportions
- Subject positioned in upper 2/3
- Environmental context bottom third
- Cinematic framing

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Framing:** Environmental context essential, wide shots showing isolation
- **Lens Equivalent:** 35mm or 50mm normal perspective on 35mm format
- **Film Stock:** Tri-X 400 pushed creating characteristic grain
- **Lighting Logic:** Natural light creating authentic shadows and highlights
- **Figure:Ground:** 40:60 ratio (subject with significant environment)
- **Density:** Sparse (minimal elements, maximum impact)

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

**Surface Context Anchor:** Vinyl LP album sleeve or fiber-based photographic print, offset lithography attempting to preserve film grain, matte finish preferred.

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT decorative frames. Photographic edges respected, image bleeds or white borders only.

**Production Context Anchor:** Gelatin silver printing from Tri-X negatives, careful scanning for album reproduction preserving grain structure, halftone screening 150-200 LPI.

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Photographic composition designed for declared ratio, environmental context optimized for format.

## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

**Binary:** MINIMAL (photography dominates)

**Ratio-Appropriate Zones:**

- Small corner placement (5-10% maximum)
- Bottom edge minimal text
- Often completely absent from front cover
- Back cover contains credits

**Copy Limits:**

- Front cover: 0-4 words maximum (often zero)
- Band name minimal or absent
- Photography speaks without text support

**Period-Appropriate Typography:**

- **Utilitarian sans-serifs:** Helvetica, Akzidenz-Grotesk, Trade Gothic
- **Size range:** 8-14pt when present
- **Placement:** Corner or edge, never interfering with photography

**Font Recommendations:**

- **Google Font:** Barlow Condensed or Archivo (85% match for industrial sans-serifs)
- **Better Match:** DIN 1451, Trade Gothic, Akzidenz-Grotesk

**Format-Specific Rules (Album Cover):**

- Front cover often text-free (photographic purity)
- Band name on spine only
- Album title minimal or absent
- Typography subordinate to cinematic imagery

**Historical Accuracy:** Typography minimal, utilitarian fonts matching austere photographic aesthetic, never decorative or attention-seeking.

**Production Method Integration:** Typography printed as separate element in offset lithography, typically black on white or reversed white on black, minimal integration respecting photographic integrity.
