## Framework Sections

### 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **3:4 portrait ratio** - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Redraw in **[Select Artist: Joyce Ballantyne | Earl Moran | Zoë Mozert] Mid-Century American Pin-Up Illustration** for **Brown & Bigelow/Shaw-Barton calendar print format**.

Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression - NOT photographic likeness.

**IP SAFEGUARD DECLARATION:** Original character design avoiding copyrighted costume elements, logos, or trademarked symbols. Create distinct visual identity appropriate to 1940s-1950s American commercial illustration.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** [Declare based on artist selection]

**Pose Flag:** [Declare based on artist selection and scenario]

**Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance:** The aesthetic conventions of mid-century pin-up calendar art completely override contemporary beauty standards, modern fashion, or photographic realism. This is commercial illustration serving the optimistic aspirations of post-war American consumer culture.

**Mode Selector:** Calendar art - single-image format designed for mass reproduction via offset lithography.

------

### 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (classical portrait - standard calendar page format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely for vertical portrait emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure positioned center-to-slightly-off-center, occupying 65-85% of frame depending on artist

1. **Brushwork & Surface:** Fat-over-lean glazing producing smooth, luminous transitions in flesh tones; visible canvas texture in thinner paint areas; seamless gradations without visible individual strokes in finished areas
2. **Color Mixing Method:** Warm palette dominance with optical mixing in shadows (glazed layers creating depth); bright, optimistic saturation levels; flesh tones built from Naples yellow, cadmium red light, yellow ochre, white base
3. **Edge Treatment:** Soft transitions between figure and background; sharper definition in focal areas (eyes, expressive hands); background edges deliberately loose
4. **Detail Hierarchy:** 70% attention to expressive face and gesture-communicating hands; 20% to narrative props; 10% to environmental context; clothing rendered with selective precision supporting story
5. **Pose Execution:** Dynamic diagonal compositions suggesting arrested motion; twisted torso angles 15-30 degrees from frontal; expressive facial acting with wide eyes, surprised mouth, raised eyebrows
6. **Scale Hierarchy:** Natural athletic proportions: 7.5-8 head heights, shoulders 1.5× head width, minimal waist compression, realistic limb proportions
7. **Lighting Logic:** Warm environmental lighting (color temp 3200-3800K equivalent) from implied domestic sources; soft ambient fill creating approachable mood; minimal dramatic shadows

#### **MORAN (Pastel on Paper):**

1. **Surface Texture:** Matte, velvety finish from light-scattering pastel particles; visible paper tooth in highlights; layered pigment creating depth without waxy buildup; no glossy reflections
2. **Stroke Economy:** Confident, directional strokes defining form; minimal blending except in flesh tone transitions; background often loosely indicated with bold marks; pastel dust creating atmospheric softness
3. **Chiaroscuro Measurement:** Key light creating 60-80% value contrast between highlight and core shadow; specular highlights on skin indicating strong single-source illumination; rim lighting defining edges against dark grounds
4. **Detail Hierarchy:** 80% attention to dramatically lit figure form; 15% to high-chroma garment rendering; 5% to minimal background suggestion; light and shadow define form more than linear detail
5. **Pose Execution:** Direct confident glamour poses; direct frontal or 3/4 view; weight distribution creating elegant s-curves; confident body positioning for maximum form definition through light
6. **Scale Hierarchy:** Systematic idealization: leg length 120-130% natural proportion (measured from hip to floor), limb diameter reduced 15-20%, waist compression 15-20%, neck elongation 110-115%
7. **Lighting Logic:** Strong key light positioned 30-45 degrees from frontal creating photography-studio modeling; dark backgrounds (50-70% canvas) emphasizing illuminated figure; minimal fill light preserving dramatic shadows

#### **MOZERT (Pastel on Paper/Board):**

1. **Surface Texture:** Soft, blended pastel finish with subtle paper tooth; consistent matte quality; realistic fabric rendering showing period-accurate materials; gentle gradations without harsh transitions
2. **Stroke Economy:** Refined blending technique creating smooth forms; visible pastel strokes in looser background areas; careful color layering for naturalistic skin tones; controlled pigment application
3. **Anatomical Consistency:** Same model proportions across all works: 7.5 head-height figure, consistent facial structure, natural limb ratios, realistic joint articulation informed by self-modeling methodology
4. **Detail Hierarchy:** 65% attention to naturalistically rendered figure; 25% to graceful pose and realistic drapery; 10% to harmonious background gradations; emphasis on achievable beauty
5. **Pose Execution:** Graceful, self-contained compositions; natural body mechanics from self-modeled poses; weight distribution creating elegant lines without strain; achievable joint angles; introspective rather than performer quality
6. **Scale Hierarchy:** Realistic proportions with minimal idealization; natural limb lengths; authentic athletic-feminine build; consistent anatomy reflecting single model reference
7. **Lighting Logic:** Soft, even studio illumination (equivalent to diffused daylight or multiple-source setup); warm-to-neutral color temperature; minimal dramatic shadows; approachable, flattering light quality

**MATERIAL PHYSICS AUTHORITY:**

- **Oil (Ballantyne):** Slow-drying allows seamless blending; glazing creates optical depth; canvas prep affects absorption
- **Pastel (Moran/Mozert):** Immediate color impact; particle structure creates matte surface; paper tooth holds pigment; layering requires care to avoid waxy buildup

------

### 4) Technical Execution (≥5 anchors + measurement specifications)

**CRITICAL PRINTING PROCESS ANCHORS:**

1. **Halftone Dot Pattern (MANDATORY):** Visible dot structure in ALL tones created by photo-mechanical screening process; dot size varies to create illusion of continuous tone; most visible in flesh tones and mid-tone areas; dot pattern typically 65-85 lines per inch for economical magazine printing
2. **Four-Color Process Limitations:** ALL colors created by superimposed red, yellow, blue, and black ink dots; no true continuous tone; secondary colors (greens, oranges, purples) show characteristic CMYK mixing artifacts; limited color gamut compared to original artwork
3. **Color Registration Drift:** Slight misalignment (0.5-2mm) between color plates creating thin color halos or ghosting, particularly visible on high-contrast edges, text outlines, and figure boundaries; result of manual plate alignment in pre-press process
4. **Paper Stock Texture:** Economical uncoated or lightly coated magazine paper with visible fiber texture; ink absorption creates slight dot gain; potential aging artifacts (yellowing, foxing, edge wear, creasing) appropriate to 70-90 year old printed ephemera
5. **Ink Saturation Characteristics:** Heavy, viscous ink application in solid color areas; slight show-through or bleed in heavily saturated zones; characteristic matte finish of period inks on economical paper stock

**ARTIST-SPECIFIC TECHNICAL ANCHORS:**

**Text Integration Methodology:**

**Manual Stripping Technique (CRITICAL FOR AUTHENTICITY):**

- Text appears physically layered OVER artwork - not integrated into painting
- Coverlines positioned in negative space to avoid obscuring figure
- Slight misalignment or registration drift acceptable and period-authentic
- Text elements cast subtle shadows or show slight color fringing from registration issues
- Color choices prioritize maximum contrast with background for readability

**Color Strategy for Text:**

- High contrast mandatory: black text on light backgrounds, white/yellow text on dark backgrounds
- Red text effective on neutral/white backgrounds (high visibility)
- Avoid text colors that blend with background - newsstand readability priority
- Secondary coverlines may use complementary colors for visual hierarchy

**Production Method Integration:**

- Typography rendered with period offset lithography characteristics
- Slight registration drift creates thin color halos on text edges (0.5-2mm)
- Halftone dots visible in colored text (not solid ink coverage)
- Text shows characteristic ink spread and absorption into economical paper stock
- Manual stripping creates authentic layered appearance

**Format-Specific Text Rules:**

**Standard Magazine Cover Mode:**

- Masthead required and dominant
- 5-7 coverlines strategically placed
- Price and date required in period-appropriate positions
- Optional promotional text at bottom
- All text must feel physically stripped over artwork

**Newsstand Competition Priority:**

- Text must be readable at 3-6 feet viewing distance
- Bold type competes with dozens of other magazine covers
- Clear visual hierarchy: Masthead > Figure > Coverlines > Price/Date
- Color contrast ensures readability in varied lighting conditions

**Historical Accuracy:**

- All typography must match 1920s-1950s commercial printing standards
- Avoid contemporary digital fonts unless close period approximations
- Manual typesetting aesthetic - slight irregularities acceptable
- Period-appropriate vocabulary in coverlines (avoid modern slang)

## Framework Sections

### 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[3:4 ratio for calendar format OR 1:1 for magazine cover]**—ignore source image dimensions completely.
- Redraw in **Rolf Armstrong Pastel Glamour Pin-Up Illustration** for **Brown & Bigelow calendar art / magazine cover format (1920s-1950s)**.
- Identity via silhouette/gesture/expression—NOT photographic likeness.
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original glamour figure design avoiding copyrighted costume elements appropriate to Art Deco/mid-century theatrical glamour aesthetic.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pastel-matte-velvety` OR `pastel-particle-diffusion`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** [Select from seated-elegant, reclined-glamour, contrapposto-theatrical, frontal-teasing, side-mysterious]
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` OR `adaptive-extend`
- **Style Dominance:** Armstrong's theatrical Art Deco glamour aesthetic completely overrides photographic realism, narrative illustration, or commercial storytelling approaches. This is isolated figure glamour on atmospheric color fields.
- **Mode Selector:** Calendar art / Magazine cover—single glamour portrait for mass reproduction.

------

### 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION (choose one exact specification):**

**PRIMARY FORMATS:**

- `3:4` (classical calendar portrait—Armstrong's primary commercial format)
- `1:1` (magazine cover format—often floating head compositions)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely for isolated glamour figure emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure occupies **80-95% of canvas** (measured average: 84.2%)
  - Head-only portraits: 90-95% occupation
  - Three-quarter figures: 80-90% occupation
  - Full figures: 75-85% occupation
- **Background Treatment:** Atmospheric pastel-textured color field serving figure emphasis—NO narrative environmental details
  - 54% solid saturated color blocks with visible granular pastel texture
  - 46% soft pastel-textured atmospheric gradients (pigment particles create transitions)
  - Zero narrative context or storytelling elements
  - **Critical texture requirement:** ALL backgrounds must exhibit pastel granularity—gradients created through layered pastel strokes with visible particle structure, NOT smooth digital blending
- **Format Justification:** Armstrong's commercial calendar format designed for home/office display; figure isolation creates theatrical glamour impact

------

### 3) Artistic Style & Context

**Influences:** Art Institute of Chicago, Académie Julian (Paris), Robert Henri's Henri School of Art; contemporary of Howard Chandler Christy; Golden Age of American Illustration (1910s-1950s)

**Medium/Production Method:**

- **Original artwork:** PASTEL on textured board using massive 3000-3600 color palette
- **Critical technique:** Worked exclusively from live models (never photographs); sometimes used articulated mannequins with custom papier-mâché masks for long poses
- **Surface characteristics:** Matte, granular texture from light-scattering pastel particles; visible paper tooth in highlights; layered pigment depth without waxy buildup
- **Mass production:** Offset lithography on calendar-grade paper (1920s-1950s) with characteristic halftone dots and slight color compression

**Thematic Purpose:** Theatrical Art Deco glamour embodying American femininity across evolving periods—from Jazz Age "flapper" sophistication (1920s-30s) to WWII-era "girl next door" curves and vivacity (1940s-50s)

**Hallmark Motifs (Quantified):**

1. **Isolated glamour figure on atmospheric background:** 100% of corpus shows figure-dominant composition with minimal/zero environmental context
2. **Kaleidoscopic color saturation:** 62% warm palette dominance (yellows, oranges, peachy flesh, reds); 31% show 3+ saturated hues in single composition
3. **"Armstrong Girl" evolution:** Early work shows "spider-lashed, boldly-adorned" floating heads; later work features "impossibly long-limbed, significantly curvier" full figures
4. **Theatrical glamour pose:** 69% seated or reclined elegant compositions; 54% direct viewer engagement with "teasing rather than seducing" expression
5. **Minimal prop usage:** 0-1 elegant accessory props maximum (mirrors, flowers, jewelry)—props are glamour accessories, never narrative drivers

**Period Framing:** 1912-1960 production era; peak commercial dominance 1920s-1950s; exclusive Brown & Bigelow calendar contracts; magazine work for Judge, Photoplay, College Humor, Screenland

**Tone Tag:** Theatrical, Art-Deco-sophisticated, vivacious, mysteriously-glamorous, teasing-not-seducing, accessible-elegance

**Production Era Authenticity:** 1920s-1950s four-color offset lithography showing visible halftone dot patterns, slight color registration drift, period paper stock texture, color compression in deepest shadows

------

### 4) Technical Execution (≥5 anchors + measurement specifications)

**CRITICAL PASTEL MEDIUM ANCHORS:**

1. **Pastel Particle Texture (MANDATORY—PRIMARY IDENTIFIER):**
   - **Surface appearance:** Matte, velvety finish from light-scattering pigment particles
   - **Granular texture REQUIRED:** Visible throughout mid-tones and shadows—NOT smooth or airbrushed
   - **Paper tooth visibility:** Textured paper surface shows through in highlight areas and lighter passages
   - **Particle structure:** Individual pastel strokes and color particles should be discernible upon close inspection
   - **Anti-smooth mandate:** ABSOLUTELY PROHIBIT glossy reflections, wet-media sheen, oil-painting smoothness, digital painting smoothness, digital airbrush perfection, or seamless gradient blending
   - **Tactile quality:** Image should suggest the physical drag of pastel sticks across textured paper
   - **Technical specification:** Add visible grain/noise texture (subtle, not heavy film grain) to simulate pastel particle scatter; matte finish throughout with NO specular highlights on skin
   - **Fabric sheen clarification:** Even "high-sheen" satin must be rendered with MATTE pastel interpretation—pigment density creates richness, not glossy photographic highlights
   - **Pigment density over gloss:** Theatrical color richness comes from LAYERED PASTEL PIGMENT DEPTH, never from surface reflectivity or digital saturation effects
2. **Layered Pigment Application:** Build depth through multiple pastel layers creating optical richness; avoid waxy buildup from over-blending; maintain granular particle structure; color vibrancy from pigment purity, not binder sheen
3. **Color Palette Specifications:** Armstrong maintained 3000-3600 distinct pastel colors; kaleidoscopic range with symbolic assignments per 1930 Screenland guide:
   - Warm dominance: 62% of works (yellows, oranges, peachy flesh, reds)
   - High chroma saturation: theatrical intensity
   - Dramatic contrast: black + saturated color combinations (38% of corpus)
   - Symbolic color psychology: specific hues assigned to personality types
4. **Edge Treatment & Stroke Economy:**
   - Soft atmospheric transitions in backgrounds (46% gradient backgrounds)
   - Sharper definition in facial features and focal areas
   - "Floating" figure effect in many compositions through vignette-style edge dissolution
   - Confident directional strokes defining form without overworking
   - Background deliberately loose to emphasize refined figure rendering
5. **Background Philosophy (ABSOLUTE DIFFERENTIATOR):**
   - **54% solid saturated color blocks:** Single vibrant hue dominating canvas (reds, oranges, blues, yellows)
   - **46% atmospheric gradients:** Soft color transitions creating depth without narrative
   - **0% environmental storytelling:** NO landscapes, interiors, props, or contextual details
   - Function: Background serves figure emphasis exclusively, never tells story
6. **Figure-to-Ground Ratio (MEASURED):**
   - Average figure occupation: **84.2%** of canvas
   - Head-only portraits: 90-95% occupation (early magazine work)
   - Three-quarter figures: 80-90% occupation
   - Full figures: 75-85% occupation
   - Minimal negative space—glamour figure dominates completely
7. **Anatomical Specifications & Evolution:**
   - **Early period (1920s-30s):** "Spider-lashed, boldly-adorned" theatrical faces; often floating heads
   - **Later period (1940s-50s):** "Impossibly long-limbed, significantly curvier" full figures
   - **Consistent proportions:** 7.5-8 head heights in full figures; shoulder width ~1.5× head width; natural athletic-glamorous build
   - **Subtle idealization:** Elongation and curves without cartoonish exaggeration
   - **Evolution driver:** Cultural shift from Art Deco theatrical flapper to WWII girl-next-door curves

**POSE ANCHORS:**

1. **Glamour Pose Philosophy:**
   - **69% seated or reclined:** Elegant composure prioritized over action
   - **54% direct viewer engagement:** "Dazzlingly smiling, flowingly maned, supple-limbed"
   - **38% side/mysterious gaze:** Alluring mystery without aggressive seduction
   - **0% narrative surprise:** NO startled reactions, mishaps, or storytelling gestures
   - **Emotional register:** "Teasing rather than seducing"—vivacious, mysterious, romantic, never dangerous femme fatale

**MATERIAL PHYSICS AUTHORITY:**

- **PASTEL substrate:** Textured paper or board holds pigment particles through tooth structure
- **Particle behavior:** Dry pigment scatters light creating matte finish; layering creates depth through particle accumulation
- **NO oil characteristics:** Absolutely prohibit smooth blended finish, glossy surface, or wet-media appearance
- **Fixative considerations:** Light fixative application maintains matte surface while preventing smudging

**REPRODUCTION ARTIFACTS (Period Authenticity):**

1. **Offset Lithography Characteristics (1920s-1950s):**
   - **Texture Hierarchy (CRITICAL):** Two-layer approach required:
     - **BASE LAYER:** Pastel texture with granular particles, paper tooth, matte surface (original artwork characteristics)
     - **TOP LAYER:** Subtle offset lithography artifacts (reproduction characteristics)
   - Visible halftone dot patterns throughout (65-85 lines per inch—VERY SUBTLE, not dominant)
   - Slight color registration drift creating thin halos on edges
   - Color compression in deepest shadow areas
   - Period paper stock texture with potential aging (yellowing, foxing)
   - CMYK color separation limitations affecting secondary colors
   - **Critical distinction:** Printing artifacts are OVERLAY on pastel texture, not replacement for it

- Fabric behavior: Liquid satin drape, theatrical richness
- **Satin/sheen fabrics:** Render with MATTE PASTEL INTERPRETATION—fabric luminosity achieved through layered pigment density and value contrast, NOT glossy photographic highlights or specular reflections

**Mid-Century Era (1940s-1950s):**

- Pin-up glamour: modest swimwear (high-waisted, one-piece), playful beachwear
- Evening wear: fitted gowns with modest necklines, elegant draping, fur accents
- Casual glamour: capri pants, fitted blouses, feminine casual wear
- Fabric behavior: Natural cotton, elegant wool, structured silhouettes
- **Satin/sheen fabrics:** When using high-sheen materials like satin, render with MATTE PASTEL INTERPRETATION—fabric luminosity achieved through layered pigment density and value contrast, NOT glossy photographic highlights or specular reflections

**ACCESSORY CAPS:** Minimalist 0-1 glamour accessories (Armstrong used minimal props as glamour accents, not narrative drivers)

**COLOR PALETTE RESTRICTIONS:**

- Warm palette dominance: yellows, oranges, peachy flesh tones, reds
- Kaleidoscopic vibrancy: 3+ saturated hues acceptable for theatrical impact
- Dramatic black + saturated color combinations
- Symbolic color assignments per Armstrong's 1930 Screenland guide

**WARDROBE VARIATION REQUIRED:** Change garment colors/styles between iterations; cycle through period-appropriate theatrical palette

**PROPS (≤1 total—CRITICAL CONSTRAINT):**

Armstrong's work shows **minimal prop usage** as glamour accessories, never narrative drivers:

```yaml
acceptable_glamour_props: [hand_mirror, flowers, jewelry, elegant_fan, fur_stole, decorative_headpiece]
ABSOLUTELY_PROHIBITED_props: [furniture, sofas, chairs, tables, beds, environmental_objects, narrative_items]
prop_function: glamour_enhancement_only
prop_count: 0-1_maximum
background_objects: NEVER_ALLOWED
```

**CRITICAL FURNITURE PROHIBITION:** Armstrong NEVER includes furniture (sofas, chairs, stools, benches) or environmental objects in his compositions. Figures float in pure atmospheric color space. ANY furniture element immediately disqualifies the work as Armstrong-authentic and creates Pike-style narrative context.

**COHERENCE FILTER:** All wardrobe and props must support isolated theatrical glamour aesthetic; period-accurate construction; elegant sophistication; fallback = clean glamour figure without props or background objects

------

### 6) Constraints

**CANVAS NEGATIVES (≥2):**

**Ratio & Format:**

- "original aspect ratio, source dimensions, unmodified framing, non-calendar proportions"
- "narrative environmental backgrounds, storytelling context, illustrated scenarios"

**Medium-Specific:**

- "oil painting smoothness, glossy surface, wet-media sheen, blended uniform finish"
- "photographic realism, camera-based rendering, digital photo filters, Instagram effects"
- "visible canvas texture (this is pastel on board, not oil on canvas)"

**Style-Specific:**

- "narrative props, storytelling scenarios, action poses, surprised expressions"
- "environmental context, landscape backgrounds, interior settings, complex scenes"
- "Jay Scott Pike commercial illustration style, narrative mishap moments"

**Period-Specific:**

- "modern digital perfection, flawless color registration, vector-smooth rendering"
- "contemporary fashion, anachronistic styling, modern makeup trends"

**CANVAS POSITIVES (≥2):**

**Ratio Enforcement:**

- "exactly 3:4 portrait ratio for calendar format, recomposed for vertical glamour emphasis"
- "figure occupation 80-95% of canvas, isolated glamour dominance"

**Medium Requirements:**

- "authentic pastel matte texture, granular pigment particles, light-scattering surface"
- "visible paper tooth in highlights, layered pigment depth without waxy buildup"
- "3000-3600 color palette vibrancy, kaleidoscopic saturation when appropriate"

**Background Philosophy:**

- "solid saturated color block OR atmospheric gradient—NO narrative environmental details"
- "background serves figure emphasis exclusively, zero storytelling context"

**Style Requirements:**

- "theatrical Art Deco glamour, elegant composure, teasing-not-seducing expression"
- "vivacious smile, flowing hair, spider-lashed eyes (period appropriate), elegant pose"
- "minimal props (0-1 glamour accessories), NO narrative storytelling elements"

**Period Authenticity:**

- "1920s-1950s offset lithography artifacts, halftone dot patterns, slight color compression"
- "period-accurate glamour fashion, Art Deco sophistication OR mid-century curves"

**VOCABULARY WARNINGS:**

- Avoid "narrative," "story," "scenario," "action," "surprise," "mishap"—Armstrong is pure glamour isolation
- Avoid "oil painting," "smooth," "blended," "glossy"—this is PASTEL
- Avoid "photographic," "realistic," "camera-based"—this is theatrical illustration
- Emphasize "theatrical," "Art Deco," "glamour," "elegant," "vivacious," "mysterious"

------

### 7) Composition & Background

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `3:4` (calendar portrait) OR `1:1` (magazine cover)

**ARMSTRONG-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

**Composition Strategy:**

- **Isolated glamour figure dominance:** 80-95% canvas occupation (measured average 84.2%)
- **Zero narrative context:** Background is pure color field serving figure emphasis
- **Format-specific approach:**
  - **3:4 Calendar:** Three-quarter or full figure, seated/reclined elegance
  - **1:1 Magazine:** Often floating head portraits with atmospheric surrounds

**Perspective:** Direct frontal or elegant three-quarter view; eye-level creating glamorous engagement; NO extreme angles or narrative perspectives

**Figure:Ground:** **84% figure / 16% background** (measured average across corpus)

- This is absolute Armstrong signature—figure dominates almost completely
- Background exists only to enhance figure through color contrast or atmospheric depth

**Density:** Minimal—figure is refined and detailed, background is simplified atmospheric color field

**Background Treatment (CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATION):**

- **54% Solid Color Blocks:** Single saturated hue dominating canvas
  - Examples: Vibrant red, rich orange, warm yellow, cobalt blue, cream
  - Function: Theatrical contrast emphasizing figure glamour
  - NO environmental details, textures, or narrative elements
- **46% Atmospheric Gradients:** Soft color transitions creating depth
  - Examples: Blue-to-pink, orange-to-yellow, cream-to-teal
  - Function: Romantic atmosphere without storytelling
  - Vignette effect common—figure emerges from soft color field
- **0% Narrative Environments:** NEVER landscapes, interiors, props, contextual details
  - This is absolute differentiator from Pike and narrative illustrators

**Lighting Logic:**

- Soft theatrical illumination creating glamorous form modeling
- Warm color temperature emphasizing romantic appeal
- Even lighting avoiding harsh dramatic shadows (contrast with Moran's chiaroscuro)
- Lighting serves beauty idealization, not dramatic storytelling

**Armstrong Mirror Reflection Technique (Optional Sophisticated Variant):** When hand mirror is used as glamour prop, consider Armstrong's signature compositional approach:

- Woman faces AWAY from viewer (back view or three-quarter turn away)
- Holds hand mirror positioned to show her face in REFLECTION
- Mirror reveals glamorous facial features and expression while maintaining elegant back/side pose
- Creates sophisticated compositional interest and allows face visibility without frontal orientation
- This technique appears in Armstrong's original corpus and demonstrates his compositional sophistication
- **Execution note:** Reflection must show accurate perspective—mirror angle determines visible facial area
- Alternative: Traditional frontal glamour pose remains equally authentic to Armstrong style

**Detail:Negative Space:**

- High detail concentration in face, hair, and focal areas
- Deliberate looseness in backgrounds and peripheral areas
- Negative space minimal due to figure dominance
- **Background texture:** Atmospheric pastel-textured color field rather than smooth digital gradient
- **Edge treatment:** "Soft" edges achieved through gradual thinning of pastel pigment particles, NOT digital blur or smooth feathering—granular texture persists even in vignette fade areas

**Surface Context Anchor:** Pastel on textured board (original); calendar paper stock (reproduction); NO canvas texture

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT entirely—Armstrong's calendar art has no decorative frames or borders outside the image

**Production Context Anchor:** Brown & Bigelow calendar format; magazine covers (Judge, Photoplay, College Humor); offset lithography reproduction 1920s-1950s

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** All compositional elements designed specifically for 3:4 vertical calendar format OR 1:1 magazine cover format; figure-dominant layout optimized for theatrical glamour impact

------

### 8) Typography & Text Integration

**BINARY POLICY:** OMIT ALL TEXT AND TYPOGRAPHY

**Rolf Armstrong Framework Standard:**

- NO calendar dates, months, or publisher marks
- NO magazine mastheads or coverlines
- NO artist signatures or text elements
- Pure glamour portrait presentation for clean art display
- Text-free canvas maintains theatrical glamour focus

**Rationale:** Armstrong's original artworks were pastel paintings; text was added during commercial printing process. For authentic artistic representation, maintain clean image presentation without typographic elements that would compromise the isolated glamour aesthetic.

------

## Style Validation Summary

**ARMSTRONG ABSOLUTE DIFFERENTIATORS:**

**Material Forensics = PRIMARY IDENTIFIER:**

- **PASTEL medium mandatory:** Granular, matte, layered particles—NO oil smoothness
- Surface must show light-scattering pigment texture, visible paper tooth
- 3000-3600 color palette vibrancy from pure pigment, not binder sheen

**Background Philosophy = GENRE DEFINER:**

- **Isolated glamour figure on atmospheric color field**
- 54% solid saturated color blocks + 46% soft gradients
- **0% narrative environmental context**—this is absolute
- Background serves figure emphasis exclusively, never tells story

**Figure-to-Ground Ratio = MEASURABLE SIGNATURE:**

- **84.2% average figure occupation**—quantified across corpus
- Minimal negative space, glamour figure dominates completely
- Head portraits: 90-95%; three-quarter: 80-90%; full figure: 75-85%

**Emotional Register = TONAL IDENTIFIER:**

- "Teasing rather than seducing"—vivacious, mysterious, romantic
- Elegant composure, never narrative surprise or action
- **69% seated/reclined poses**; **54% direct glamorous engagement**
- Never dangerous femme fatale—accessible theatrical glamour

**Prop Philosophy = NARRATIVE CONSTRAINT:**

- **0-1 glamour accessories maximum**—props are elegant accents, not story drivers
- Mirrors, flowers, jewelry acceptable; narrative props PROHIBITED
- Function: enhance glamour, never establish scenario

**Period Evolution = CULTURAL CONTEXT:**

- **1920s-1930s:** Art Deco theatrical sophistication, spider-lashed flappers, floating heads
- **1940s-1950s:** WWII girl-next-door curves, fuller figures, vivacious warmth
- Consistent: theatrical glamour isolation on atmospheric backgrounds

**ANTI-PATTERNS (Avoid These Absolutely):**

- Oil painting smoothness or glossy surfaces (this is PASTEL)
- Narrative environmental backgrounds or storytelling context (Pike territory)
- Action poses, surprised expressions, or scenario mishaps (Armstrong is pure glamour)
- Multiple narrative props or complex scenes (Armstrong is isolated figure)
- Photographic realism or camera-based rendering (theatrical illustration)

**PERIOD AUTHENTICITY:** 1912-1960 production; peak 1920s-1950s; Brown & Bigelow calendars; magazine covers; offset lithography reproduction with halftone artifacts

**IP PROTECTION:** Original glamour figure designs; no copyrighted costumes or trademarked symbols; period-appropriate theatrical styling

**CONTENT BOUNDARIES:** Elegant theatrical glamour appropriate to 1930s-1950s calendar standards; modest sophistication; teasing vivacity without explicit content; all subjects adult (21+)

- **Safety/IP:** **No nudity**; bare shoulders and décolletage acceptable within 1950s advertising standards; no copyrighted brand logos or product designs; create original beverage bottle designs if props required
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Adult female subjects (apparent age 20-28); modest glamour within commercial advertising standards
- **Gender expression:** Feminine glamour presentation consistent with post-war Hollywood aesthetic
- **Material authenticity:** Authentic oil painting surface characteristics followed by period halftone reproduction artifacts; no modern digital photo filters or Instagram effects
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1940s-1950s oil painting techniques with subsequent photomechanical lithographic reproduction for calendar/advertising distribution
- **Composition boundaries:** No decorative frames outside canvas; no artificial presentation borders, watermarks, or artist signatures (Runci signature if present should be subtle lower corner in paint)
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid sultry/mysterious expressions, overt sexuality, dark moody lighting, photographic realism, modern makeup trends, Instagram aesthetics
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail

------

## Framework Sections

### 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

- **CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **[X:Y ratio]** - ignore source image dimensions completely
- Redraw in **Edward Runci Hollywood Glamour Pin-Up style** for **1940s-1950s commercial calendar/advertising artwork**
- **Likeness Mandate:** Identity via source model's actual hair color, eye color, facial structure, and complexion preserved through Runci's idealization technique - style enhances features rather than replacing them with generic blonde/blue-eyed archetype
- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original character design avoiding copyrighted costume elements, trademarked products, or identifiable celebrity likenesses; if beverage props included, create original bottle/label designs
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `airbrush-soft-glamour`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `glamour-portrait-stance`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** [select appropriate]
- **Style Dominance:** Post-war Hollywood glamour aesthetic (radiant joy, aspirational beauty, commercial approachability) overrides photographic realism or sultry pin-up conventions
- **Mode Selector:** Commercial calendar portrait

------

### 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION (choose one exact specification):**

**PORTRAIT FORMATS:**

- `2:3` (standard commercial poster/calendar preferred)
- `3:4` (classical portrait alternate)
- `4:5` (modern poster adaptation)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Extend atmospheric background gradients to fill declared ratio while maintaining 70-80% figure dominance
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned in upper 60-70% of frame, slight off-center for dynamic balance
- **Background Treatment:** Soft atmospheric gradient wash extending seamlessly to canvas edges, no architectural detail
- **Format Justification:** [Ratio] provides optimal figure dominance for commercial glamour portrait presentation consistent with calendar/advertising format

------

### 3) Artistic Style & Context

- **Influences:** Post-WWII Hollywood portrait photography (George Hurrell glamour lighting), 1940s film noir cinematography (strong directional lighting with soft fill), commercial advertising illustration standards (approachable aspirational beauty)
- **Medium/Production method:**
  - *Original:* Oil on canvas with soft-focus portrait technique, airbrush-smooth blending on facial features, visible brushwork in hair and fabric
  - *Reproduction:* Four-color (CMYK) halftone lithography at 150 lpi for calendar/poster distribution, smooth coated paper stock
- **Thematic purpose:** Commercial advertising glamour combining Hollywood sophistication with warm approachability; aspirational beauty standard for post-war consumer culture
- **3-5 hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**
  1. **Radiant confident smile** - open genuine expression showing upper teeth, Cupid's bow lip definition, no sultry or mysterious affect
  2. **Idealized facial construction** - eyes enlarged 130-140% of anatomical proportion, soft-focus skin rendering with airbrush-smooth transitions, 3-5 highlight planes (forehead, cheekbones, nose bridge, chin)
  3. **Volumetric hair styling** - hair mass 180-220% of natural skull volume, 3-5 tonal layers creating dimensional depth - **Applied to source model's actual hair color (brunette/black/auburn/blonde), NOT automatic blonde transformation**
  4. **Atmospheric gradient backgrounds** - soft vignette effect darker at edges, no architectural detail, color fields in deep reds, forest greens, navy blues, sky blues, soft pinks, or creams
  5. **Bare shoulder emphasis** - strapless, off-shoulder, or modest necklines with shoulder exposure, cleavage suggested not explicit, white/cream/pastel costume preference (8/13 images)
- **Period framing:** Post-WWII commercial glamour (1945-1955), Hollywood golden age aesthetic, American consumer optimism
- **Tone Tag:** Radiant, confident, approachable, aspirational, warm glamour
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Original oil paintings (1945-1960s) reproduced via photomechanical lithography for Shaw-Barton Calendar Company and corporate advertising clients (Coca-Cola era commercial art)

------

### 4) Technical Execution (≥5 anchors + measurement specifications)

- **Facial rendering method:** Airbrush-smooth imperceptible tonal transitions on skin, no visible pore texture or brushstrokes on face, soft-focus glamour technique, specular highlights on nose tip, forehead center, cheekbones, chin point
- **Eye construction:** Enlarged 130-140% anatomical proportion, almond shape with pronounced upper lid crease, single bright catchlight upper-right placement typical, individual eyelash strokes 8-12 per eye, iris detail with radial pattern - **CRITICAL: Preserve source model's actual eye color (brown, hazel, green, blue) and apply Runci's enlargement/highlight technique to that natural color; do NOT default to generic light eyes**
- **Lip rendering:** Precise Cupid's bow definition, corners lifted in smile, upper teeth fully visible, lower teeth suggested, tonal gradation creating volume (3-4 values from highlight to shadow)
- **Hair rendering technique:** Visible brushstrokes in 3-5 tonal layers following form and volume, individual strand work on edges contrasting with mass tone interior, directional stroke work emphasizing hairstyle architecture (victory rolls, pin curls, waves) - **CRITICAL: Preserve source model's actual hair color (brunette, auburn, black, blonde) and apply Runci's volumetric technique to that natural color; do NOT default to platinum blonde unless source model is blonde**
- **Skin tone palette:** Base tone matches source model's natural complexion (pale, medium, olive, tan) adjusted to Runci's idealized peach-warm glow, rose-mauve shadow tones in recesses, cream-white highlights with subtle yellow, uniform idealized complexion eliminating blemishes/texture while preserving ethnic/individual skin tone characteristics
- **Background execution:** Loose atmospheric wash technique, pure color field with tonal gradation creating soft vignette (darker edges), minimal to zero architectural or environmental detail, 2-3 depth planes maximum (background wash, figure, occasional foreground prop)
- **Fabric rendering:** Simplified planes of light and shadow defining form, edge sharpness varies by material (crisp for satin, soft halo for fur), texture implied through tonal variation not surface detail, specular highlights for satin/silk, soft diffusion for fur/cotton
- **Lighting architecture:** Upper-left 45-degree key light creating dimensional form shadows, soft ambient fill eliminating harsh contrasts, occasional rim light on hair/shoulders for separation from background
- **Pose Anchors:**
  - Head tilt 15-35° from vertical toward right shoulder (11/13 images)
  - Shoulder rotation 20-40° creating 3/4 turn, one shoulder forward
  - Hand placement touching face/hair (5/13) or holding prop at chest level (6/13), fingers extended never clenched
  - Direct eye contact with viewer (7/13) or upward aspirational gaze
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** 70-80% figure dominance, bust or 3/4 length framing, tight cropping with minimal negative space, subject's face occupies 25-35% of total canvas area
- **Material Authenticity Anchor:** Oil paint surface with smooth facial blending contrasting visible hair/fabric brushwork; no digital smoothing artifacts, no photographic grain, no modern makeup contouring - **Likeness anchor: preserve source model's distinctive facial geometry (nose shape, jawline, cheekbone structure, face shape) while applying Runci's soft glamour rendering**
- **Period Consistency Anchor:** 1945-1955 Hollywood glamour conventions, post-war beauty standards (fuller figures than modern ideals, softer facial structure, period-appropriate hair/makeup)
- **Production Method Anchor:** Halftone dot pattern at 150 lpi for reproductions, four-color CMYK process, letterpress ink characteristics (dark halo edge with lighter center on dots), smooth coated paper substrate
- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for declared aspect ratio with atmospheric background extension maintaining tonal consistency

------

- **Beach/leisure:** Strapless swimsuits with modest coverage, white terry cloth wraps, fabric hair accessories
- **Period construction:** 1940s-1950s silhouettes (fitted bodices, defined waist emphasis, fuller skirts when visible), no modern fashion elements

**Fabric behavior:**

- **Satin/silk:** Specular highlights with smooth gradation, crisp edge definition
- **Fur:** Soft halo effect with minimal texture detail, luminous white/cream tones
- **Cotton/terry:** Matte finish with subtle form shadows, softer edge transitions
- **Rendering principle:** Fabric identified through light behavior not surface texture

**Accessory caps:** Minimalist 0-2 items maximum

- **Jewelry:** Pearl necklaces, bracelets, subtle elegant pieces

- **Accent:** Emerald green, gold, coral, deep red for evening wear (3/13 images)
- **Saturation:** Medium-high chroma, never muted or dusty, jewel tones for contrast
- **Period accuracy:** 1940s-1950s textile dye technology, avoid neon or modern synthetic colors

**Wardrobe variation required:** If generating series, vary costume colors/styles between iterations while maintaining period aesthetic - cycle through pastel palette and evening jewel tones

**Props:** 1 hero prop maximum (total ≤1), fallback = no props

- **Primary function:** Establish commercial advertising context or add narrative interest
- **Period authenticity:** Props must be consistent with 1945-1955 material culture

**YAML prop pools:**

------

### 7) Composition & Background

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:**

*For Portrait Ratios (2:3, 3:4, 4:5):*

- Vertical emphasis with subject positioned in upper 60-70% of frame
- Figure dominance 70-80% typical
- Bust or 3/4 length framing with tight cropping
- Atmospheric background extends to canvas edges via gradient

**STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

- **Perspective regime:** Shallow depth of field, 2-3 spatial planes maximum (background wash, figure, optional foreground prop), no architectural perspective
- **Grid/symmetry:** Slight off-center positioning for dynamic balance (subject occupies 50-60% width, positioned 40-60% from left edge)
- **Figure:ground %:** 70-80% figure dominance with minimal negative space
- **Density %:** Low environmental density, emphasis on singular subject and atmospheric color field
- **Lighting logic:**
  - Primary: Upper-left 45-degree key light creating form-defining shadows
  - Fill: Soft ambient fill light eliminating harsh contrasts, maintaining glamour glow
  - Rim: Optional hair/shoulder separation light
  - Effect: Dimensional modeling without dramatic noir darkness
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** High negative space in background (pure color field), concentrated detail in face/hair, simplified treatment of costume/props
- **Depth planes:**
  1. **Background:** Atmospheric gradient wash (darker at edges creating soft vignette)
  2. **Figure:** Primary subject in sharp focus with dimensional modeling
  3. **Foreground:** Optional prop (florals, beverage) in matching or slightly softer focus

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Commercial calendar or advertising poster presentation - image exists as printed lithographic reproduction on smooth coated paper stock
- **Frame/Band Anchor:** FORBIDDEN - no decorative presentation frames, no borders outside canvas edge, no mat treatment; only original canvas edge acceptable; subtle artist signature in lower corner if present
- **Production Context Anchor:**
  - *Original creation:* Oil on canvas, smooth surface preparation, glamour portrait technique
  - *Mass reproduction:* Halftone lithography, 150 lpi screen, four-color CMYK process, coated paper substrate, calendar or poster format

### 4) Technical Execution (≥5 anchors + measurement specifications)

- **Airbrush rendering method:** Primary technique throughout - delicate softness creating absolutely flawless skin appearance, luminous highlights on high points, imperceptible tonal transitions, zero visible pores or texture, porcelain-like surface quality
- **Facial rendering:** Moderate detail with soft definition - eyes almond-shaped medium-large, nose delicately minimal, lips full Cupid's bow, chin soft rounded, cheekbones subtly defined - all rendered with airbrush smoothness and gentle transitions
- **Hair rendering:** More visible dimensional work than face/body - varied edge quality from soft to defined, color layering creating depth, period-appropriate 1940s styling (victory rolls, pin curls, waves, updos) - **CRITICAL: Preserve source model's actual hair color (blonde/brunette/auburn/red) and apply Vargas technique to that natural color**
- **Eye construction:** Medium-large almond shape, expressive without exaggeration, soft transitions around lids, delicate lash definition - **CRITICAL: Preserve source model's actual eye color and apply Vargas's soft rendering to that natural color**
- **Skin tone palette:** Base tone matches source model's natural complexion (pale/medium/olive/tan) adjusted to Vargas's idealized peachy-cream glow with rose-pink shadow tones, luminous white-cream highlights, uniform flawless complexion eliminating all texture while preserving ethnic/individual skin tone characteristics
- **Anatomical idealization:** Extreme leg elongation 60-75% of figure height, impossibly slender thighs tapering to delicate ankles, extremely narrow waist creating exaggerated hourglass, slender graceful arms, delicate sloping shoulders, small delicate hands/feet - stylized idealization NOT realistic anatomy
- **Body rendering:** Minimal anatomical detail, smooth idealization with no visible musculature, gentle curves suggested through soft tonal transitions, absolutely no skin texture visible anywhere on figure
- **Background execution:** Flat solid color field (pure white, off-white cream, pale pink/blue/yellow), zero gradients, zero architectural or environmental detail, figure exists in colorful void, complete isolation technique following Petty precedent
- **Edge treatment:** Soft figure edges blending gently into background, crisper costume edges defining garment boundaries, varied hair edge quality, gentle transitions avoiding harsh lines throughout
- **Line work presence:** Virtually absent - pure tonal modeling, painterly rather than illustrative, occasional light guidelines barely visible if at all
- **Detail hierarchy:** Face receives moderate soft detail, hair more dimensional, body minimally detailed smooth idealization, costume simplified fabric suggestions, props (if any) simplified forms
- **Lighting architecture:** Diffuse non-directional seeming to emanate from figure itself, minimal to absent shadows on figure, flat background with no lighting variation, ethereal dreamlike illumination creating luminous glow
- **Pose Anchors:**
  - Full figure display emphasis, legs prominently featured occupying 60-75% height
  - Graceful elongated positioning - seated, reclining, standing, playful
  - Hand gestures delicate and feminine - touching face, holding props, arms extended for line flow
  - Direct confident eye contact (9/16) or averted charming gaze
  - Dynamic yet elegant - never crude or aggressive
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** 80-95% figure dominance with minimal negative space, figure fills frame efficiently, complete focus on idealized feminine form

**Wardrobe tracks (wholesome 1940s-1970s American girl-next-door):**

- **Casual wear:** Shorts/tops, skirts/blouses, casual dresses, everyday American fashion
- **Swimwear:** One-piece bathing suits, modest 1940s-1960s coverage
- **Lingerie/sleepwear:** Slips, robes, nightwear - revealed accidentally through narrative not posed
- **Costumes/performance:** Carnival outfits, western wear, performance attire for narrative context
- **Period construction:** 1940s-1970s silhouettes and styling, no modern fashion anachronisms

**Fabric behavior:**

- **Rendering:** Dimensional fabric weight shown through realistic draping, folds indicating material (heavy cotton, light silk, structured wool), fabric response to movement and gravity
- **Detail:** Visible seams, buttons, trim details rendered with oil painting brushwork
- **Interaction:** Fabric displaced by wind, action, or accident creating narrative

**Stockings and hosiery:**

- **Style:** Seamed stockings, visible garter straps and garter belt
- **Narrative function:** Often revealed "accidentally" through action - skirt blown up, leg extended, clothing displaced
- **CRITICAL BOUNDARY:** Show stockings/garters/garter belt ONLY - **NEVER show undergarments (panties, brassiere)**
- **Period accuracy:** 1940s-1960s hosiery styling with wholesome "oops" humor

**Footwear:** Heels typical

- **Types:** Pumps, ankle straps, saddle shoes, period-appropriate styles
- **Colors:** Coordinated with costume
- **Rendering:** Dimensional form, material indication (leather, fabric)

**Accessory caps:** Moderate variety

- **Types:** Hair bows, jewelry, belts, hats
- **Constraint:** Accessories support narrative, never clutter composition

**Color palette restrictions:**

- **Costumes:** Bright primaries (red, blue, yellow), pastels (pink, lavender), white
- **Saturation:** High chroma vibrant colors typical of commercial calendar art
- **Variety:** Extensive wardrobe color variety across different scenarios
- **Period accuracy:** 1940s-1970s textile colors, avoid modern neon or synthetic hues

**Wardrobe variation required:** Vary costume types, colors, and styles between iterations while maintaining period aesthetic and wholesome appeal

**Props:** Props REQUIRED - fallback = minimum 1 prop

- **CRITICAL:** Props are ESSENTIAL for Elvgren narrative storytelling - NEVER omit
- **Function:** Establish scenario, create action, enable story, provide humor context
- **Integration:** Figure actively using/interacting with props, not decorative placement

**YAML prop pools:**

- **Density %:** Moderate environmental density - enough detail to establish narrative without cluttering, props and setting elements support story
- **Lighting logic:**
  - Source: Natural directional from specific location (sun, window, lamp)
  - Shadows: Cast shadows on ground/objects establishing spatial relationships
  - Quality: Warm outdoor sunlight or cool interior lighting scenarios
  - Effect: Dimensional form modeling through consistent light direction
  - **NEVER:** Diffuse ethereal glow, ambient non-directional light, figure seeming to emit own light
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** Balanced detail distribution - highest on figure face, high on figure body/props, moderate-high on near environment, atmospheric reduction in distance
- **Depth planes:**
  1. **Foreground:** Props, environmental elements in sharp focus
  2. **Mid-ground:** Figure with highest detail and dimensional modeling
  3. **Background-near:** Environmental context (architecture, furniture, ground plane) with clear detail
  4. **Background-mid:** Setting elements with moderate detail
  5. **Background-far:** Atmospheric perspective with reduced detail, cooler color temperature, softer edges

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

# George Petty Pin-Up Illustration

**Based on visual analysis of 17 authentic artworks (1933-1955)**

------

## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `diffusion-glam`
 **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion`
 **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
 **Style Dominance:** Petty's streamlined aesthetic overrides photographic likeness; identity conveyed through gesture, expression, silhouette.

**CANVAS OVERRIDE MANDATE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** – ignore source image dimensions completely.

**Safety Guardrails:**

- No nudity or suggestive posing
- Modest period-appropriate attire only
- No underwear visible
- No controversial political imagery
- No copyrighted logos or trademarks
- No real signatures or watermarks
- Subject must appear adult (age 21+)
- Respectful gender expression
- No frames outside canvas
- No artificial presentation borders or watermarks

------

## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 portrait ratio** for 1930s-1940s magazine page format. Ignore source dimensions.

Redraw subject in **George Petty 1930s-1940s American Pin-Up Illustration style** for magazine print reproduction.

**IP Safeguard:** Create original costume designs avoiding copyrighted elements. No recognizable brand imagery, logos, or trademarked symbols.

**Face-Treatment Flag:** `diffusion-glam`
 **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion`
 **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`

**Style Dominance:** Petty's streamlined Depression-era fantasy aesthetic supersedes photographic realism. Convey identity through sophisticated gesture, playful expression, and exaggerated silhouette rather than facial likeness.

**Mode:** Single magazine illustration print.

------

## 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (portrait magazine page format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Recompose entirely for vertical portrait emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Figure occupies 75-90% of composition height, centered horizontally
- **Background Treatment:** Extend stark white background to fill 2:3 canvas completely
- **Format Justification:** Magazine tear-out format designed for pinning up; vertical orientation maximizes leg elongation visual effect

------

## 3) Artistic Style & Context

**Influences:** 1930s Streamline Moderne industrial design aesthetic applied to female form; airbrush commercial illustration technique refined in photographic retouching studios.

**Medium/Production Method:**

- Original: Watercolor and gouache on illustration board using precision airbrush with transparent frisket masking, combined with red/orange gestural line underdrawing
- Reproduction: Offset lithography on 1930s-1940s magazine paper stock with period printing limitations

**Thematic Purpose:** Depression-era masculine fantasy commodity for Esquire magazine – sophisticated, consumer-focused "Petty Girl" personality presenting tasteful consumption lifestyle. Not wholesome patriotism.

**Hallmark Motifs:**

1. **Head size 60-70% realistic proportion** – deliberately shrunk relative to body
2. **Leg elongation 150-180% realistic length** – unnaturally extended limbs
3. **Torso elongation 120-140% realistic length** – statuesque vertical emphasis
4. **Neck elongation 110-120% realistic length** – subtle but consistent
5. **Boneless tapered fingers** – delicate, impossibly graceful hands

**Period Framing:** 1933-1955, peak work 1933-1941 for Esquire magazine; later work for True magazine and Ridge Tool Company calendars.

**Tone Tag:** Playful sophistication, knowing glamour, consumer fantasy, Depression-era escapism.

**Production Era Authenticity:** Wartime paper rationing meant lighter-weight, cheaper paper stock; period offset lithography with color registration limitations and visible paper texture.

------

## 4) Technical Execution

### CRITICAL MIXED RENDERING MANDATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

**MANDATORY GESTURAL LINE WORK REQUIREMENT:** At least one hand AND both feet MUST show visible red/orange gestural line underdrawing with minimal or NO airbrush rendering. This mixed technique is the signature Petty characteristic that distinguishes authentic work from generic pin-up illustration. Failure to include visible sketch lines in extremities produces inauthentic results.

**PROHIBITED:** Uniform full rendering across all body parts. Avoid equal detail throughout figure. The detail hierarchy (face detailed → hands mixed → feet sketchy) must be immediately visible to the viewer.

### Airbrush Technique Anchors (≥5 required):

1. **Imperceptibly smooth gradations** – No visible steps or bands in color transitions; continuous gradation from highlight to shadow achieved through multiple light airbrush passes
2. **Frisket masking for razor-sharp edges** – Transparent mask cut precisely to create clean boundaries between color fields; costume edges, hair boundaries, prop separations all show crisp lines with zero feathering
3. **Plasticine surface quality** – Smooth, synthetic, porcelain-like finish with completely matte texture; no visible paint grain, brushstrokes, or surface irregularity
4. **Reserved white paper highlights** – Brightest highlights are untouched illustration board showing through; no white paint application
5. **Warm peach/pink skin base** – Foundation skin tone in warm peach-pink range with orange/red airbrushed shadows for dimensional modeling; cooler tones reserved for deep shadows

### Mixed Rendering Hierarchy (CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION ELEMENT):

1. **Face and torso fully rendered** – Complete airbrush modeling with high detail: facial features sharp, makeup defined (arched eyebrows, eyeliner, rouge, red lips), body volume fully realized with smooth gradations
2. **HANDS MIXED TECHNIQUE (MANDATORY)** – At least ONE hand must show visible red/orange gestural line sketches with MINIMAL or NO airbrushing; loose confident single strokes indicating fingers and palm; boneless tapered characteristic; other hand may be fully rendered. AVOID rendering both hands with equal airbrush detail.
3. **FEET PREDOMINANTLY GESTURAL (MANDATORY)** – BOTH feet must show primarily linear red/orange indication; ballet pointe shoes rendered as loose sketched outlines with ribbon indication only; heels as gestural line work; MINIMAL volume modeling; NO fully airbrushed feet. This is non-negotiable.
4. **Props selectively detailed** – Hero props (telephone, industrial machinery) fully rendered with metallic reflections and precise detail; secondary props gestural line completion
5. **Hair flattened with sharp edges** – Hair rendered with frisket-masked boundaries creating graphic flat shapes; avoid volumetric modeling or soft edges; streamlined silhouette prioritized over dimensional realism

### Pose Anchors:

1. **Dynamic diagonal body thrust** – 47% of compositions use angled torso creating diagonal energy across frame; alternative: vertical elongated stance emphasizing leg length
2. **Head tilt 10-25 degrees** – Slight angle adds playfulness; avoid rigid frontal positioning
3. **Hip-shoulder counter-rotation** – Torso twist creates S-curve silhouette enhancing streamlined aesthetic
4. **Weight distribution asymmetric** – One leg bears weight, other extended for maximum leg line display; or both legs extended in airborne ballet leap
5. **Arms extended or raised** – Hands interact with props, telephone, or positioned overhead/behind head; avoid arms hanging straight down

### Scale Hierarchy Anchor:

1. **Proportional measurements intentionally distorted** – Head 60-70% realistic size, legs 150-180% realistic length, torso 120-140% realistic length, neck 110-120% realistic length; maintain these ratios precisely for authentic Petty aesthetic

### Material Authenticity Anchor:

1. **Authentic airbrush characteristics** – No digital blur filters, no soft brush tools, no gradient mesh effects; surface must exhibit period airbrush application: smooth but not digital, matte but not flat, with subtle tonal variation from multiple light passes suggesting layered technique

### Period Consistency Anchor:

1. **1930s-1940s offset lithography reproduction** – Slight color registration drift, visible paper texture (cream/off-white magazine stock), period halftone dot pattern in shadows, non-archival aging effects (subtle yellowing, potential foxing spots)

### Canvas Adaptation Anchor:

1. **Composition optimized for 2:3 portrait ratio** – Figure placement maximizes vertical leg line within portrait format; head in upper 20%, legs extending to lower 10%; horizontal centering with minimal headroom

### Visual Hierarchy Verification:

When viewing the completed illustration, the rendering detail progression should be immediately apparent: highly detailed face/torso → visible gestural line work in at least one hand → predominantly sketch-line feet with minimal volume. If all elements appear equally rendered, the result is inauthentic.

------

## 5) Fashion & Attire – Wardrobe Matrix + Prop Selector

### Wardrobe Tracks (Adult Feminine):

**Primary Costume Categories:**

- **One-Piece Swimsuits**: Form-fitting period swimwear with modest coverage, high-cut legs, decorative elements like bows or stars; colors: saturated blues, coral pink, teal, red
- **Playsuits/Rompers**: Short shorts with wrap tops, halter tops, or crop tops; bows, ties, decorative closures; colors: pink, white with contrasting accents

### Fabric Behavior:

- **Flat color application** – Costumes rendered in saturated solid colors with minimal internal shading; fabric folds indicated by sharp value changes rather than gradual modeling
- **Streamlined drape** – Fabric follows body curves smoothly; avoid heavy wrinkles or complex folds
- **Period-accurate construction** – 1930s-1940s swimwear, playsuit, and sportswear silhouettes with historically appropriate cuts and closures

### Accessory Caps: Minimalist (0-2)

**Footwear Options:**

- **Ballet pointe shoes**: Preserve unbroken leg line; rendered as gestural line work with ribbon indication; colors: pale pink, white, costume-coordinated
- **Period heels**: Peep-toe, sling-back, platform styles; loose sketched outlines; coordinated with costume
- **Casual flats**: Minimal detail, gestural indication only

**Hat Options:** Wide-brimmed sun hat, cap with decorative element, visor, theatrical costume hat (witch, toreador, etc.)

**Glove Options:** Long evening gloves (white, cream), work gloves (yellow/cream) – only when thematically appropriate

**Jewelry:** Minimal to none; occasional bracelet or anklet as delicate line indication only

### Color Palette Restrictions:

- **Primary costume colors:** Saturated blue, coral/salmon pink, red, white, teal, mint green
- **Accent colors:** Orange, yellow, brown, black for contrast elements
- **Avoid:** Muddy colors, earth tones (except for specific costume themes), neon brights, excessive pattern

### Wardrobe Variation Required:

Change primary costume colors and styles between iterations; cycle through period-appropriate palette and costume categories avoiding identical repetition.

### Props (Maximum 1 Hero Prop):

**Hero Prop Options:**

- Vintage rotary dial telephone (signature Petty motif)
- Industrial machinery (Ridge Tool Company equipment with metallic finishes)
- Seasonal thematic elements (broomstick for witch, bouquet for bride, etc.)

**Prop Rendering:** Hero props fully rendered with attention to form, shadows, and material quality (metallic reflections, etc.); secondary elements gestural line completion only

**Prop Scale:** Often oversized relative to figure for visual impact and composition

### Coherence Filter:

All costume and prop elements must support 1930s-1940s Depression-era sophisticated fantasy aesthetic; avoid wholesome patriotic Americana; fallback = clean minimal scene with swimsuit or playsuit.

------

## 7) Composition & Background

### Ratio-Specific Composition (2:3 Portrait):

- **Vertical emphasis mandatory** – Figure elongation emphasized by portrait format
- **Subject dominance 75-90%** – Figure occupies overwhelming majority of composition height
- **Hierarchical staging** – Head in upper 20%, torso in middle 50%, legs extending to lower 10% (or beyond frame for maximum elongation effect)
- **Minimal headroom** – Tight cropping at top to maximize leg line display

### Style-Specific Composition:

- **Perspective regime:** Flattened space with no environmental depth; figure isolated against void
- **Grid/symmetry:** Horizontal centering typical; vertical asymmetry through pose dynamics
- **Figure:ground ratio:** 80:20 (figure 80%, background 20%)
- **Density:** High detail in face and torso (60% of figure), minimal detail in extremities (40% of figure)
- **Lighting logic:** Diffused overhead lighting with soft shadows; avoid hard directional light or dramatic chiaroscuro
- **Detail:negative space ratio:** Concentrated detail in upper body, expansive white negative space surrounding figure optimized for 2:3 ratio

### Required Anchors:

**Surface Context Anchor:** Illustration board (original artwork); magazine paper stock (reproduced version) – specify magazine printing on period paper with visible texture

**Frame/Band Anchor:** OMIT ENTIRELY – No frames, borders, or decorative bands outside canvas edge; Petty Girl exists in void

**Production Context Anchor:** 1930s-1940s offset lithography on wartime magazine paper stock (lighter weight, cream/off-white color, potential aging effects); period printing limitations include slight color registration drift, visible halftone dot pattern in shadows, non-archival paper yellowing

**Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** Composition designed specifically for 2:3 portrait ratio with vertical elongation emphasis; figure placement, pose selection, and background treatment all optimized for magazine page format

### Background Treatment:

**Primary:** Stark white reserved paper – no paint application, pure void surrounding figure

**Secondary:** Flat pastel color field – subtle airbrush application in mint green, pale pink, cream, or teal; no gradation or atmospheric effects

**Tertiary:** Minimal drop shadow – soft airbrushed shadow beneath figure in cool gray or complementary tone

**Prohibited:** Complex environments, landscapes, architectural elements, furniture (except as hero prop), realistic settings, multiple light sources
