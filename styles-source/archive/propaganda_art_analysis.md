## Soviet Constructivism (1915-1930s)

### Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

**Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are hard constraints; earlier overrides later.

**Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.

**Face-Treatment Flags:**

- `geometric-faceted` - Angular reduction to geometric planes
- `photomontage-collage` - Photographic fragments with graphic overlay
- `diagonal-dynamic` - Extreme angles, radical perspectives
- `constructivist-industrial` - Machine-age precision

**Pose Flags:**

- `diagonal-revolutionary` - Dynamic 45-degree angles
- `heroic-worker` - Monumental labor positioning
- `photographic-crop` - Extreme close-up fragmentation
- `geometric-abstraction` - Reduced to essential forms

**Canvas Control Flags:**

- `strict-reframe` for poster formats
- `adaptive-extend` for spatial compositions

**Media Hybrid Flag:**

- `photo-geometric-overlay` - Photomontage with typography integration

**Material Physics Authority:** Offset lithography with photomechanical reproduction **Technical Measurement Authority:** Diagonal compositions 30-60°, photographic scale 150-300% enlargement **Process-Over-Result Priority:** Photomontage cutting and layering technique supersedes seamless appearance **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Deliberately uncomfortable diagonal viewing angles authorized

------
## 1) Core Instruction & Likeness Mandate

**CANVAS OVERRIDE:** Recompose to exactly **2:3 ratio** (standard Soviet poster format) - ignore source image dimensions completely.

Redraw in **Soviet Constructivist agitprop poster style (1919-1930)** for **lithographic offset printing with photomontage**.

- **Timeframe:** Revolutionary propaganda period (1919-1930), peak avant-garde 1922-1928
- **Degree of likeness:** Geometrically abstracted through photomontage; emphasis on revolutionary dynamism over individual features
- **Emotional tone:** Revolutionarily urgent, industrially optimistic, dynamically propagandistic, geometrically modern
- **Pose conventions:** Diagonal revolutionary poses at 30-60° angles; extreme photographic cropping; heroic upward gazes; industrial tool interaction

**IP Safeguard Declaration:** Original constructivist design avoiding Soviet state emblems or specific historical figures; create abstract revolutionary worker archetype.

**Style Dominance:** Constructivist geometric abstraction and photomontage technique override photographic naturalism.

**Mode Selector:** Agitprop poster for mass public mobilization.

------
## 2) Canvas Strategy & Aspect Ratio Control

**MANDATORY RATIO:** `2:3` (Soviet standard poster format 50x70cm / 20x28in)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** Strict vertical recomposition with diagonal emphasis
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject positioned on dynamic diagonal axis, typically lower-left to upper-right
- **Background Treatment:** Geometric shapes (circles, triangles, lines) in bold red/black/white
- **Format Justification:** 2:3 vertical allows heroic monumentality while maintaining street poster readability

------
## 3) Style Context & Material Authenticity

**Influences:** Russian avant-garde (Suprematism, Futurism), industrial design aesthetics, photomechanical reproduction, revolutionary agitation

**Medium/Production method:** Offset lithographic printing with photomontage technique - photographs mechanically cut and layered with geometric shapes and bold sans-serif typography. Surface exhibits halftone dot patterns at 85-133 LPI (lines per inch). Ink application: 1.5-2mm wet film thickness.

**Thematic purpose:** Revolutionary mass mobilization through visual shock and geometric clarity; merge art with industrial production; communicate Party directives to semi-literate masses.

**Hallmark motifs:**

1. Diagonal compositions at 30-60° angles creating dynamic tension
2. Photographic elements cropped to 150-300% scale emphasizing monumentality
3. Bold geometric shapes (red wedges, black circles, dynamic lines) at 40-60% canvas coverage
4. Sans-serif Cyrillic typography integrated as design element (30-40% of composition)
5. Limited color palette: 85% red/black/white, 15% yellow accents

**Period framing:** Revolutionary Russia 1919-1930, peak Constructivist agitprop 1922-1928 before Socialist Realist suppression.

**Tone Tag:** Revolutionary-urgent, geometrically-precise, photographically-shocking, industrially-optimistic

**Production Era Authenticity:** Offset lithography with visible registration marks; slight color misalignment 0.5-1mm; paper texture shows 120-150gsm newsprint absorption.

**Photomontage Construction:** Photographic fragments cut with precision blades; layered with 2-3mm overlap; mechanical enlargement 150-300% creating grain enhancement; sharp edge transitions between photo/graphic

**Color Application:** Flat areas 95% solid coverage; red (Pantone 185C equivalent); black 100% density; white paper stock showing through; maximum 3 colors per poster

**Typography Integration:** Sans-serif geometric fonts (constructivist style); letterforms 25-50% of composition height; diagonal/vertical text orientation; tight letter spacing 0-5% tracking

**Detail Hierarchy:** Photographic faces/hands rendered 80% detail; geometric shapes 100% flat; typography 100% legible from 3m distance; minimal atmospheric depth

**Surface Texture:** Offset lithography exhibits mechanical dot patterns; slight ink spread on newsprint absorption; registration drift 0.5-1mm between colors

**Pose Anchors:** Head tilt 15-30° creating diagonal; shoulders rotated 20-40° from frontal; one arm raised 45-60° upward; heroic gaze 10-15° above horizon

**Scale Hierarchy:** Central figure 60-70% canvas height; geometric shapes 40-50% coverage; typography 20-30% integrated; background 10-20% negative space

**Material Authenticity:** Authentic photomontage cutting technique with visible edges; mechanical halftone reproduction; authentic offset printing characteristics
