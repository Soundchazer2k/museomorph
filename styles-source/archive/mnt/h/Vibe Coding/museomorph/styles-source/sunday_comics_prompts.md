# **Sunday Comics - Museum-Grade Framework**

- ## Charles M. Schulz - 1950s-1970s Comic Strip Collection Aesthetic

  ------

  ## 🔧 Renderer-Agnostic Adapter (Schulz-Specific)

  - **Constraint precedence:** Sections **1→8** are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
  - **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared 2:3 aspect ratio.
  - **Style over likeness:** Likeness via simplified geometric silhouette and minimalist line economy.
  - **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("1.5-2mm pen lines", "65-85 LPI halftone", "±0.5-1mm registration drift") override descriptive language.
  - **Process-Over-Result Priority:** India ink application with Esterbrook 914 radio pen and 1960s offset printing supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
  - **Custom Flag Authorization:** Schulz-specific technical flags permitted for authentic reproduction.
  - **Anti-Conventional Bias:** Authority to generate deliberately sparse, melancholic aesthetics when historically accurate.
  - **Face-Treatment Flag:** `pen-crosshatch` with mechanical consistency, dot eyes 3mm diameter, curved line mouths 8-12mm wide
  - **Pose Flag:** `frontal-rigid` with bilateral symmetry, minimal perspective distortion
  - **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe` for 2:3 vertical emphasis
  - **Media Hybrid Flag:** Not applicable - pure pen-and-ink illustration
  - **Material Physics Authority:** Strathmore 3-ply paper, India ink, Esterbrook 914 radio pen (drawing), Speedball C-5 pen (lettering) specifications override aesthetic preferences.
  - **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Newsprint reproduction requires simplified detail hierarchy and high-contrast line work.
  - **Cultural Production Authenticity:** 1960s-1970s American mass-market paperback methods take precedence over modern printing.
  - **Quantifiers authoritative:** All numeric specifications (line weights, halftone frequencies, registration tolerances) are binding targets.
  - **Text policy:** Always allow text for cover format - hand-lettered titles essential.
  - **Safety/IP:** No Peanuts characters, names, or copyrighted elements; create original "Beagle" universe characters.
  - **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Characters are children - simple, modest clothing appropriate to 1950s-1970s suburban youth.
  - **Gender expression:** Simple, non-gendered children's clothing variations.
  - **Material authenticity:** No digital smoothing, vector conversion, or modern gradient effects - authentic halftone dot structure required.
  - **Period Production Authenticity:** 1960s-1970s offset printing limitations (visible dots, registration drift, ink spread) are mandatory, not optional.
  - **Composition boundaries:** No decorative frames - cover bleeds to trim edges.
  - **Failure Mode Flags:**
    - Avoid: anime autopilot, digital vector smoothness, modern printing perfection, gradient shading, complex linework variation
    - Require: mechanical line consistency, visible halftone structure, period printing artifacts, simplified geometric forms
  - **Silent validation:** Apply Schulz technique checklist (round heads, zigzag stripes, minimalist features, flat composition, hand-lettered text); regenerate silently if fail.

## 4) Technical Method & Mark-Making

  **Line Quality:**

  - **Primary tool:** Technical pen 0.3mm-0.5mm producing consistent 1-point line weight
  - **Nervous quality:** Intentional slight wavering in longer lines (2-3mm deviation per 10cm)
  - **Crosshatch density:** 1-2mm spacing for mid-tones, 0.5-1mm for shadows
  - **Contour precision:** Clean outer edges with minimal correction marks visible

  **Color Application (Sunday editions):**

  - **Watercolor transparency:** 20-40% opacity for background washes
  - **Limited palette:** Earth tones (ochre, sienna, sage) + primary spot colors
  - **Wet-on-dry technique:** No color bleeding, distinct edges between washes
  - **White paper retention:** 30-40% of panel remains unpainted

  **Texture Methods:**

  - **Stippling density:** 8-12 dots per square centimeter for skin textures
  - **Parallel hatching:** 45-degree angle, 1-2mm line spacing
  - **Cross-hatching:** Secondary layer at 90-degree offset for deepest shadows
  - **Brush texture:** Visible individual bristle marks in watercolor areas

  **Pose Anchors:**

  - **Animal anatomy accuracy:** Skeletal structure correct beneath anthropomorphic clothing
  - **Human gesture mapping:** Recognizable human body language translated to animal proportions
  - **Expression economy:** 3-5 facial features convey complex psychological states
  - **Physical comedy:** Exaggerated proportions up to 150% for comedic effect

  **Scale Hierarchy:**

  - **Figure dominance:** Characters occupy 40-60% of panel space
  - **Environmental detail:** Background elements 20-30% smaller than foreground
  - **Text integration:** Caption box 15-20% of total panel height

  **Material Authenticity:**

  - Visible pen pressure variation in line weight
  - Watercolor paper texture evident in unpainted areas
  - India ink matte finish, no digital sheen
  - Hand-lettered caption text with slight irregularity

  **Period Consistency:**

  - 1980s-90s newspaper reproduction limitations
  - Halftone dot pattern in color separations
  - Registration drift ±0.5mm in color alignment
  - Newsprint paper absorption creating soft edges

  ------
## 5) Wardrobe, Props & Setting Conventions

  **Wardrobe Tracks:**

  - **Animal-as-human:** Business casual, scientific lab coats, generic contemporary clothing
  - **Human characters:** 1950s-80s American suburban/rural aesthetic
  - **Period accuracy:** Avoid contemporary fashion post-1995

  **Fabric Behavior:**

  - **Cartoon simplification:** Minimal folds, 2-3 lines suggest draping
  - **Pattern economy:** Stripes, polka dots, simple geometric patterns only
  - **Color limitation:** Solid colors or simple two-tone combinations

  **Accessory Caps:**

  - **Minimalist:** 1-2 props maximum per panel
  - **Scientific equipment:** Beakers, microscopes, field guides rendered accurately
  - **Everyday objects:** Telephones, chairs, simple household items

  **Color Palette:**

  - **Earth tones dominant:** Browns, tans, muted greens
  - **Accent colors:** Limited bright spots for focal points
  - **Historical dye limitations:** Colors achievable with 1980s newspaper printing

  **Wardrobe Variation:**

  - Cycle through period-appropriate casual/professional mix
  - Avoid identical costumes between iterations

  **Props (YAML pool):**

  ```yaml
  scientific_equipment:
    - microscope
    - beaker
    - field_notebook
    - specimen_jar
  household_items:
    - rotary_telephone
    - simple_chair
    - basic_table
    - window_frame
  nature_elements:
    - cactus
    - rock_formation
    - simple_tree
    - grass_tuft
  ```

  **Coherence Filter:** All elements support absurdist scientific scenarios; fallback = minimal environment

## 6) Safety & IP Constraints (Hard Rules)

  **❌ Canvas Negatives (≥2):**

  - "original aspect ratio"
  - "source dimensions"
  - "digital smoothing"
  - "gradient shading"
  - "photorealistic rendering"
  - "complex background detail"
  - "ornate decoration"
  - "conventional beauty"

  **✅ Canvas Positives (≥2):**

  - "exactly 4:3 daily panel ratio"
  - "pen-and-ink crosshatch texture"
  - "watercolor wash transparency 20-40%"
  - "nervous line quality with 2-3mm natural wavering"
  - "scientific terminology accuracy"
  - "absurdist animal anthropomorphization"
  - "newsprint reproduction limitations"
  - "1980s newspaper printing halftone dots"

  **Vocabulary Warnings:**

  - Avoid "beautiful," "harmonious," "elegant"
  - Avoid "detailed background" or "intricate pattern"
  - Avoid "smooth gradient" or "digital polish"

  ------
## 7) Composition & Lighting Patterns

  **RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (4:3 daily):**

  - Horizontal emphasis with central focal point
  - Character(s) occupy 40-60% of frame
  - Simple environmental context 30-40%
  - Negative space 10-20% for visual breathing room

  **STYLE-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION:**

  - **Perspective regime:** Minimal perspective, near-flat staging
  - **Grid/symmetry:** Informal balance, slight asymmetry preferred
  - **Figure:ground %:** 60:40 character to environment
  - **Density %:** 50-60% panel coverage, intentional emptiness
  - **Lighting logic:** Simple top-down illumination, minimal shadows
  - **Detail hierarchy:** Sharp focus on characters, simplified background

  **REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

  - **Surface Context:** White Bristol board texture with visible tooth
  - **Frame/Band:** Single black border 2-3mm width; Sunday editions may include decorative rope/branch border
  - **Production Context:** Newspaper newsprint with halftone reproduction
  - **Ratio Enforcement:** Composition designed for declared newspaper column format

  ------
## 8) Typography & Text Integration (If Historically Present)

  **Binary:** ALLOW (essential to humor delivery)

  **Caption Requirements:**

  - **Zone placement:** Bottom 15-20% of panel in rectangular box
  - **Copy limits:** ≤25 words per caption, single sentence preferred
  - **Hand-lettered aesthetic:** Slight irregularity in letter spacing and baseline
  - **Font recommendation:**
    - Closest: "Special Elite" (typewriter analog, 75% match)
    - Better inspiration: Hand-lettered caption style with ruler-guided baselines

  **Format-Specific Rules:**

  - **Daily format:** Single caption below image or speech balloon integration
  - **Sunday format:** May include title header "The Peculiar Perspective" with decorative border
  - **Text emphasis:** Deadpan delivery, scientific vocabulary, setup-punchline structure

  **Historical Accuracy:**

  - Hand-lettered text with visible guideline marks
  - Consistent but imperfect letter heights
  - Caption box borders hand-drawn with technical pen

  **Production Method:**

  - India ink lettering on same Bristol board as illustration
  - White correction fluid for text errors creating visible texture
  - Newsprint reproduction softening text edges slightly
