## Renderer-Agnostic Adapter

- **Constraint precedence:** Sections 1→8 are **hard constraints**; earlier overrides later.
- **Canvas Override Mandate:** Always ignore source image dimensions; compose for declared target aspect ratio.
- **Style over likeness:** Likeness via silhouette/gesture/expression unless photographic.
- **Technical Measurement Authority:** Quantitative specifications ("3-5mm impasto thickness", "60-degree brush angle") override descriptive language.
- **Process-Over-Result Priority:** How oil paint is applied supersedes visual appearance descriptions.
- **Commercial Illustration Authority:** Saturday Evening Post editorial constraints take precedence over fine art preferences.
- **Narrative-First Mandate:** Every compositional element must serve clear storytelling function.
- **Anti-Slick Bias:** Visible bristle brush texture required; smooth sable finish explicitly prohibited.
- **Face-Treatment Flags:** `oil-fat-over-lean`, `bristle-brush-texture`, `impasto-sculptural`, `glazing-layers-buildup`, `mixed-media-linear`
- **Pose Flags:** `candid-motion`, `psychological-tension`, `gestural-fluid`, `cultural-traditional`
- **Canvas Control Flags:** `strict-reframe`, `adaptive-extend`
- **Material Physics Authority:** Oil paint application, canvas preparation, and bristle brush specifications override aesthetic preferences.
- **Scale-Dependent Technique:** Magazine cover reproduction requirements affect brushwork precision and detail hierarchy.
- **Narrative Production Authenticity:** Every element serves clear storytelling purpose - no decorative elements.
- **Quantifiers authoritative:** numeric anchors are targets.
- **Text policy:** Only render text if Section 8 authorizes - magazine mastheads/coverlines only.
- **Safety/IP:** No nudity/gore; no real logos/watermarks/signatures.
- **Age & wardrobe guardrail:** Minors = modest 1940s-appropriate clothing; unknown age defaults to adult neutral.
- **Gender expression:** Respect presented within period social norms.
- **Material authenticity:** Authentic oil painting techniques with visible bristle brush marks; no digital simulation.
- **Period Production Authenticity:** 1940s-1950s Saturday Evening Post reproduction methods - offset lithography halftone patterns.
- **Composition boundaries:** Magazine cover format with potential masthead integration zone.
- **Failure Mode Flags:** Avoid fine art autopilot, abstract elements, dramatic angular perspectives, glamour photography aesthetics.
- **Silent validation:** Apply checklist, regenerate silently if fail.

- **IP Safeguard Declaration:** Create original sincere, homespun character designs avoiding copyrighted magazine elements appropriate to Rockwell's editorial constraints.
- Declare **Face-Treatment Flag:** `oil-fat-over-lean`
- Declare **Pose Flag:** `candid-motion`
- Declare **Canvas Control Flag:** `strict-reframe`
- **Style Dominance line:** Narrative illustration over aesthetic perfection.
- **Mode Selector:** Magazine cover editorial illustration.

------

### 2) Canvas Strategy & Spatial Logic

**MANDATORY RATIO SELECTION:** `2:3` (Saturday Evening Post cover format)

**CANVAS RECOMPOSITION STRATEGY:**

- **Reframing Method:** extend-background and recompose-entirely for magazine cover layout
- **Spatial Allocation:** Subject placement in upper 60% with lower 40% potential masthead zone
- **Background Treatment:** Environmental context supporting narrative without overwhelming figures
- **Format Justification:** Vertical portrait optimized for newsstand visibility and editorial content integration

------

### 3) Artistic Style & Context

- **Influences:** American Realism movement, Ashcan School mentorship (Robert Henri), Old Master genre painters (Pieter Bruegel), commercial illustration traditions
- **Medium/Production method:** Oil on double-primed linen canvas, bristle brush application, impasto buildup with glazing techniques, raw sienna imprimatura base
- **Thematic purpose:** Human-interest narrative illustration for mass-market family magazine audience
- **5 hallmark motifs with quantified specifications:**
  1. **Expressive Faces:** Genuine emotion through extensive model direction - 15-20 degree head tilt variations, authentic character casting over conventional beauty
  2. **Character-Defining Hands:** Occupational/personality revealing hand positions - gnarled laborer hands vs. graceful feminine gestures, specific 45-degree finger articulations
  3. **Authentic American Figures:** Sincere, homespun types - 0% glamour models, 100% neighbor/friend casting, Michelangelo classical proportions for heroic figures
  4. **Meticulous Prop Detail:** Weather-beaten authentic objects - field-purchased farmer trousers, genuine period accessories, 3-5mm paint texture on fabric rendering
  5. **Narrative Center Focus:** All gazes/gestures directing toward single story point - mathematical convergence within 15-degree cone angle
- **Period framing:** 1940s-1950s peak Saturday Evening Post era, wartime/post-war American optimism
- **Tone Tag:** Heartwarming, sincere, accessible American family values
- **Production Era Authenticity:** Offset lithography reproduction requirements - visible halftone dot patterns, newsprint color limitations, magazine paper texture absorption

### 4) Technical Execution (≥5 anchors + measurement specifications)

- **Oil Paint Application:** Mixed technique combining opaque impasto (3-5mm thickness) with translucent glazing, fat-over-lean layering methodology, bristle brush texture preservation
- **Surface Preparation:** Double-primed linen canvas or gessoed Masonite panel, warm raw sienna imprimatura wash, tempera-like luminous quality achievement
- **Brush Technique:** Rubens long bristle flat brushes exclusively, 60-degree angle application for visible texture, explicit avoidance of sable brushes for non-slick finish
- **Color Mixing Method:** Complete color studies on photographic layouts before final canvas, specific Winsor & Newton palette: French ultramarine blue, viridian, lemon yellow, cadmium yellow pale, yellow ochre, raw sienna, raw umber, burnt sienna, vermilion, cadmium red deep, Venetian red, zinc white, ivory black
- **Detail Hierarchy Anchor:** Meticulous prop accuracy with subordinated background elements, clear center of interest establishment, narrative clarity over decorative perfection
- **Pose Anchors:** Choreographed authentic action through model direction, specific verbal coaching documentation ("Toe in! Raise your elbow. Relax! Lean forward!"), extensive reference photography integration
- **Scale Hierarchy Anchor:** Figure dominance 70-85% of picture plane, environmental context 40-60% supporting without overwhelming
- **Material Authenticity Anchor:** Authentic oil painting surface characteristics with measurable impasto thickness and visible bristle marks - no digital simulation permitted
- **Period Consistency Anchor:** All elements serve 1940s-1950s editorial illustration function with documented Saturday Evening Post production methods
- **Canvas Adaptation Anchor:** Composition optimized for 2:3 magazine cover format with masthead integration consideration
