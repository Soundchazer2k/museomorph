### 7) Composition & Background

**RATIO-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION (German Portrait Format):**

- **Vertical emphasis:** Conceptual element dominance with psychological spatial tension
- **Subject allocation:** Primary symbolic motif 40-60% canvas, positioned for maximum interpretive challenge
- **Hierarchical staging:** Concept > typography > background structure

**HILLMANN-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION ANCHORS:**

- **Perspective regime:** Flattened 2D graphic space rejecting realistic depth illusion in favor of symbolic arrangement
- **Figure-ground relationship:** 50% conceptual element, 50% active negative space creating psychological tension
- **Density specification:** Extreme minimalism with single powerful idea and strategic emptiness
- **Lighting logic:** Conceptual rather than realistic lighting serving psychological narrative
- **Detail hierarchy:** Maximum precision on central metaphor, structural minimalism for supporting elements

**BACKGROUND TREATMENT:**

- **Surface Context:** Flat color fields or carefully controlled negative space serving compositional architecture
- **Integration method:** Backgrounds as active structural elements rather than passive settings
- **Symbolic function:** Environmental elements serving metaphorical rather than literal narrative purpose
- **Color relationships:** Background colors supporting conceptual theme through psychological association

**REQUIRED ANCHORS:**

- **Surface Context Anchor:** Mid-century poster paper simulation with matte finish and period absorption characteristics
- **Frame Policy:** No decorative frames - clean modernist edge-to-edge composition
- **Production Context Anchor:** 1955-1975 offset lithography with German commercial printing standards
- **Ratio Enforcement Anchor:** All elements engineered specifically for German film poster format

### 8) Typography & Text Integration

**BINARY DECISION:** Typography essential as architectural structural element

**IF TYPOGRAPHY ALLOWED:**

- **Ratio-Appropriate Zones:** Typography integrated as primary compositional architecture, not information overlay
- **Copy limits:** Film title + essential credits with modernist hierarchy
- **Period-Appropriate Typography:** Clean geometric sans-serif fonts reflecting German modernist design principles

**HILLMANN-SPECIFIC TYPOGRAPHY:**

**Primary Font Recommendations:**

- **Architectural text:** Clean geometric sans-serif with structural precision. Closest Google Font: Work Sans (modernist geometry, 80% match). Better: Helvetica or Univers with engineered spacing
- **Title typography:** Bold geometric forms functioning as compositional elements. Closest Google Font: Montserrat (geometric structure, 75% match). Better: Futura or Akzidenz-Grotesk
- **Credit hierarchy:** Structured modernist sans-serif with German design precision. Closest Google Font: Source Sans Pro (utilitarian clarity, 85% match). Better: DIN or similar technical sans-serif

**TYPOGRAPHY INTEGRATION RULES:**

- **Architectural function:** Typography as primary visual element occupying 15-25% canvas area
- **Structural hierarchy:** Text elements serving compositional organization rather than mere information delivery
- **Modernist precision:** Clean geometric letterforms with engineered spacing and alignment
- **Conceptual integration:** Typography supporting rather than competing with central metaphorical concept

**PRODUCTION METHOD INTEGRATION:** Typography rendered with offset lithography precision - hard edges, flat color application, period-appropriate registration characteristics

**FORMAT-SPECIFIC RULES:**

- **Art house cinema mode:** Typography as intellectual architectural element supporting conceptual challenge
- **German design tradition:** Modernist principles with post-war reconstruction aesthetic sophistication
- **International distribution:** Clean geometric forms maintaining legibility across cultural contexts
